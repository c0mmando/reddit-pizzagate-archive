        <strong>[/r/conspiracy Xpost] Reminder: Aaron Swartz was likely killed for attempting to expose the elite's pedophile ring.</strong>

        <p><p>The story is that Aaron in his quest for horizontal information sharing pulled the entire JSTOR archive and despite the fact that JSTOR wanted to drop charges, the feds (including the secret service) wanted to go after him hard. MIT could have been able to intervene to assist but seems not to have.</p>
<pre><code>"The MIT investigation seemed to me reasonably well done. MIT's contribution to the tragedy was mostly negative: It didn’t take aggressive measures to try to free him from the charges, or at least mitigate them, as it should have," Chomsky told HuffPost. "Part of the tragedy is that there were apparently very good opportunities to reduce the punishment to something fairly limited, nothing like the crazy threats of the prosecution in the early days."
</code></pre>
<p>The idea is that because he was a political activist and quite successful at that, that they thought they would make an example of him. If that's the case however, why did the need the full force of the secret service and FBI involved and not simply rely on the legal system to fuck him up.</p>
<pre><code>"Among the documents released are accounts of the several raids the federal government made on Swartz's property. In these accounts are pages upon pages of lists of all of the property the government confiscated from him. Pages worth of hard drives, phones, computers, iPods, and compact discs were seized."

<p>I'm struggling to find a working link to the rense article that started this line of inquiry. I did find a copy of it on facebook but if I include that link this post gets deleted. Just type facebook dot com before this /DavidShurter/posts/538236202889492 if you want to see it.</p>
<p>Yoichi Shimatsu presents the idea that elite academics from American universities frequently visit South East Asian orphanages and child housing to exploit them for their pedophilic tendencies and satanic ritualistic abuse. One of the primary investigators of this story was killed after they fell from their high rise apartment in Thailand when police were coming to arrest them.</p>
<pre><code>"Nicholas Negroponte with the notorious President Kagame. "The 'One Laptop per Child' project was initiated by the MIT Media Lab founder, who is the brother of former UN ambassador and intelligence official John Negroponte." "
</code></pre>
<p>Nicholas Negroponte works with MIT and allegedly is involved with child abuse videos.</p>
<pre><code>"Frank Moss, who was trained at the Technion Institute in Haifa, a center for the Israeli Defense Force’s cyberwarfare R andD projects. The Media Lab itself is heavily involved in military-related projects with the US Air Force, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, the Army Research Office and Google, which is a high-tech contractor in artificial intelligence for DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) ."
</code></pre>
<p>"MIT Media Lab is yet another spin-off from the all-powerful MK-ULTRA and DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency).</p>

<p>Just putting together a few dots here, but Penn state uni has been involved with Sandusky, Alan Dershowitz of Harvard defends Jerry Epstein the billionaire pedophile, Nicole Kidman's father from Sydney University of Technology was allegedly involved before his death:</p>
<pre><code>"It has emerged that Nicole Kidman's father died after fleeing Australia when accused of the sexual abuse and murder of children in an elite Sydney pedophile ring. A month prior Fiona Barnett had filed a complaint with the Australian NSW police and Child Abuse Royal Commission alleging Kidman’s sexual and physical assaults on her throughout childhood. When the Commission opened an investigation the clinical psychologist suddenly left his 43 years with the Sydney University of Technology and Royal North Shore Hospital to stay in Singapore until he died. "
</code></pre>
<p>The intelligence community don't seem to interested in pursuing internal allegations of such behaviour within the Pentagon</p>
<pre><code>"In 2006, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which conducts Internet pornography investigations, produced a list of 5,200 Pentagon employees suspected of viewing child pornography and asked the Pentagon to review it. But the Pentagon checked only about two-thirds of the names, unearthing roughly 300 defense and intelligence employees who allegedly had viewed child pornography on their work or home computers."
</code></pre>
<p>It's pretty well established that the CIA is well aware of this, and with all likelihood heavily involved, considering George Bush Snr's claims that Sandusky's boys organization was a ray of light in this world and the myriad of other allegations surrounding their murky dealings.</p>
<p>Here's something to take the idea further though: Noam Chomsky and the Willful Ignorance of 9/11</p>
<p>http://digwithin.net/2013/11/29/chomsky/</p>
<p>In this the author cites a number of statements by Chomsky that demonstrate either intellectual dishonesty and hypocrisy or intentional dishonesty.</p>
<p>Miles Mathis takes this even further in his piece on Chomsky being a spook: http://mileswmathis.com/chom.pdf</p>
<p>Mathis presents ample information which shows Chomsky's involvement with numerous individuals associated with intelligence and propaganda efforts, strange numerology, possible deception for his academic work, intentional obfuscation of linguistic principles etc.</p>
<p>IF Aaron pulled the entire MIT network and found pedophile information, he may well have pulled sensitive documents from Chomsky which would have blown his cover as a spook. Chomsky is basically the gatekeeper of the left and if he fell, a whole shower of shit would reign down. Chomsky's misinformation on 9/11 would cause people to investigate it properly, his role in the scuttling of occupy would become obvious and all manner of other deceptions. He'd be an asset that must be protected at all costs, hence the secret service involvement and heavy handedness on coming down on Swartz. </p></p>
