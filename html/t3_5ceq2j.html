        <strong>[Suggestion] Anonymous website for uploading all evidence/theories, since neither Reddit nor 4chan can be fully trusted anymore</strong>
        <p><p>I've been seeing a lot of reddit and 4chan posts related to comet ping pong being deleted, it would be a good idea to create a website with DDOS protection on which we can upload all evidence related to the crap its going on. </p>
<p>Doing this can speed up and generate new evidence, and we could have all the evidence in one place. This can REALLY help bring this situation to public eyes and maybe even start an investigation against them.
We could use a .onion link for better security.</p></p>

        <p><p>I, for one, would love a visual map that shows the various connections between people, organizations, and major evidence. I've been doing my best to keep up but inevitably I miss things whenever I take breaks, and it's a bit easy to get lost trying to keep up with what things have been found already. I agree that the censorship is a huge problem. I was shocked at how there's still not any major coverage on it, other than a few more obscure sites claiming Clinton has been 'tied' to a trafficking ring.</p></p>

<p>This is helpful. Maintained by a /r/conspiracy &amp; /r/C_S_T &amp; /r/sorceryofthespectacle regular:</p>

<p>Great software, but it is shareware. You have to pay to import maps from another computer or the web. Also I don't super trust their handling of potentially sensitive data, as their application isn't open source.</p>
<p>A problem I keep having relating to this case is finding the original post regarding a certain link or bit of evidence. Mostly since a lot of the posts are deleted from 4chan. Reddit's search is fucking horrid, so I resort to using google in the fashion of (terms just an example):</p>
<pre><code>site:reddit.com "comet ping pong" "james alefantis" -"spirit cooking"
</code></pre>
<p>And then setting the advanced search options "Time: Custom Range" for appropriate dates. This is especially helpful when a term has become media wildfire (#SpiritCooking) and you're wondering when the fuck it was first used and in what context (for instance, I can't find Crowley referencing anything about cannibalism or cooking/eating kids. It might have been a metaphorical reference using other terms, I guess - someone enlighten me if you know). There are still sites that backdate their content, which obviously makes things a little confusing, but it still helps narrow the field.</p>
<p>Even with all that l still sometimes have to settle with coming up empty, it's bullshit. Gotta start archiving everything I come across and making a huge spreadsheet and filling a column with all the tags for each piece.</p>

        <p><p>Going to copy this comment from another post here as I think it is pertinent.</p>
<p>I'm not a religious man, I'm not a supernatural believer, I'm not very trusting, I'm not one to believe in conspiracy theories that are far out. </p>
<p>However I am one that understands that evil in this world exists and in ways that I could never even fathom. I also understand that just because something sounds outrageous. (One of the things for me, a place like heaven after I die.) I still don't discredit it and write it off, because the absolute truth is that I DONT KNOW and NO ONE has ever truly known.</p>
<p>I think that applies here to a degree considering the amount of smoke billowing out at this point. Do I believe all of this is true? Unlikely, for instance the Obama flying in pizza and hot dogs thing, probably Occam's Razor should apply.</p>
<p>However, there is no denying, once you look through the information at hand that something is off. I mean just the sheer amount of affiliations with known pedo's in this social circle is a cause to be weary. These are actual people that have confessed or were in imprisoned. Solid facts. That are associated with names mentioned throughout.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, how many pedo's do you know or have you known in your social circle throughout your life? Me? None. </p>
<p>Its disconcerting at the least and at the most does call for an discerning eye to sift through and ensure there isn't cause for alarm.</p>
<p>Another thing I'd like to add, and you may judge, is that I did not vote in this election, didn't even pay attention to politics at all. Hell I was watching impressions last night and saw some of Trump and thought, well, I don't know that one because I havn't really watched him speak. </p>
<p>I know, I'm a poor citizen of America for not caring. My point being that I in no way have an agenda for Trump in reference to this scandal. I could give a f about him. I do care about childrens lives, and the evil that can destroy them.</p>
<p>I say all this, and bare with me as I know it sounds cookoo, but is legitimate because think about how they would react if this were true. If there was a higher level/political ring of sorts that was involved in something so Diabolical. </p>
<p>If that were true, then right now there best bet would to make sure that anyone investigating was deemed a "Conspiracy Nut". I mean wouldn't that be the most effective way of dousing the flames. Delete pics, delete weird stuff, hire a few online trolls to get on sites like Reddit and 4chan, where this stuff is breaking, and completely discredit them.</p>
<p>A person going through may be thinking, wow, this actually has some pretty disturbing warning signs. This may need to be investigated. But then read a comment like some on this page and remember, "Oh silly, c'mon, shit like this doesn't happen, look at you being so foolish and thinking something so evil like this could happen."</p>
<p>Evil happens.
True evil.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is real, I hope, hope hope, it is not. But, IF IT IS. Just what if it is? We must do something about it. The only way we could something about it is by the general populace accepting it, allowing folks like the FBI to investigate and have the publics support, because without OUR support? Well anyone could scrub off a lone conspiracy nut.</p>
<p>In conclusion, be semi-open minded with a scrutiness eye. </p>
<p>Be weary that people are hired to post "troll" comments on forums to swing opinions.</p>
<p>Lastly, do not doubt the evil in this world, but also do not doubt the good.</p></p>

<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cdvfr/message_the_mods_over_at_rthe_donald_to_white/d9w1ho3/?context=3</p>
<p>The_Donald has been actively censoring any pizza-related threads and banning the users for the past few days.  They are not the safe haven of information people think them to be, and what's troubling is the vast majority of their users are unaware of whats happening.</p></p>

        <p><p>To do that you need to identify the trustworthy people first, which in itself is nearly impossible given the nature of 4chan and reddit.  I'd suggest at least having an IRC channel, but "trust nobody" still applies.  Since we're all strangers anyway, you never know.</p>
<p>The best approach in my mind is just to know that the data is what the data is.  Preserve everything.  Screenshot everything.  Backup everything in multiple locations.  Independently validate findings with other users.  There's always the risk of somebody removing content, but also the risk of trolls / shills ADDING content to make the situation seem like a big joke, i.e. downloading a Comet Instagram picture, adding steg where there was no steg, and posting that elsewhere in anticipation of it being discovered as a fake.</p>
<p>It's inherently problematic to say the least.</p></p>

        <p><p>How is 4chan being compromised?  I thought that place was safe from CTR and the like?</p>
<p>Also,  keep in mind the pedoring now knows a lot of people know their codes, signs and symbols so they will be changing them.  Look for changes in words.</p>
<p>They are going to stop using "pizza".  They are going to hide and try to erase their tracks.  There move to hide and erase their tracks <em>will leave tracks</em> so follow those as well.</p>
<p>God bless you hero autists.</p></p>

        <p><p>godlikeproductions.com is a Tavistock Operation...go ahead and type "Tavistock" on that site and see what happens...they are covering up these crimes against humanity at the very least and wouldn't surprise me if the high level mods on that site are perpetrating them.  All "conspiracy" sites are compromised.</p></p>

        <p><p>Is imgur a good choice? I recall them removing images, prompting the_donald to move to sli.mg instead. I can't say if sli.mg is a better solution, but if imgur is possibly removing images it isn't a safe place for storing or sorting evidence.</p></p>
