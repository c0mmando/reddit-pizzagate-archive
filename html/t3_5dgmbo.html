        <strong>The art is for money laundering</strong>
        <p><p>Art is a low tax commodity that is often retraded and sold. How didn't we realize this?</p></p>

        <p><p>Of course.  But, "modern art" is mostly a joke.  Like, the people who create it laugh at the people who "get it," because the people who create it know it's just a vessel for money.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's an outlet for thoughts that take form in geometry and colors. The primal human mind communicates with patterns and there are great modern artists that highlight that. One of my favorite artist, nicolaas warb, almost exclusively does this. </p>
<p>I recommend we take a step back to appreciate the things and beings the syndicate are abusing. Understand their beauty and purity, whether it's a truly unique mind or a thought painted. </p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>nicolaas warb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Dutch painter of modern art?  All this occult stuff traces back to Amsterdam, Brussels, etc.  Exactly where he is from.</p>
<p>Sure, art can be subjective.  You can draw a few red triangles on a canvas, scribble on top of that, and jizz to flavor... it may look interesting, I guess.  Not to me.</p>
<p>I view it in terms of technique, effort, style, mechanism, etc.  Less subjective terms.</p>
<p>They view it in the amount of money it covers.  That it resells... they laugh all day.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah I agree and respect your opinion. Even if an awful man, his art catches my eye. It's modernist Islam geometry and giri. Just my 2c</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>How does it trace back to Amsterdam?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why did Donald Trump call Brussles a hell hole?</p>
<p>The US is a Dutch colony.  That's where the Freemasonry and black magic occult stuff comes from.  The system is/was run by Freemasonry to some extent.  I'm sure there's overlaps between the child rings, the child charities, government, pizza, etc.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm getting old.  I want to say "it's only rock and roll," but look at the black metal scene.  Burning churches.</p>
<p>Look at Ron Johnson YouTube channels <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN2LHSIB1BQ&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLJ1kS_c52TRfF7pMg5R1HJhdm_0gjaNjX">videos on the occult in Amsterdam</a>.  They had a NYE "vampire" party I think last year were people where showered with blood.  They did this at a club.</p>
<p>The EU is based from Brussles.</p></p>

        <p><p>sure of course its for laundering,</p>
<p>its also possible that its to attract more rich pedo buy-ins
how simple is it it to come to an art convention, stare at a picture of a little boy and say "damn that is sexy" to the people in charge there. </p></p>

        <p><p>I've notice Art collectors and shows swirling around this whole mess. No secret, and not saying it proves anything but Tony Podesta has an amazing/world famous art collection. Probably nothing but if you walk out of Comet PP and make a right...the next building is Chevy Chase Art Gallery. No website. zero reviews anywhere.</p></p>

        <p><p>Art School Drop-Out here:</p>
<p>Jeff Koons (top 5 wealthiest living artists) from his wiki:</p>
<p>Koons is a member of the Board of Directors of the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (ICMEC), a global nonprofit organization that combats child sexual exploitation, child pornography, and child abduction.[129] In 2007, Koons, along with his wife Justine, founded the ICMEC Koons Family Institute on International Law and Policy.[130] It is the International Centre's research arm.[131][132][133][130]</p>
<p>As highlighted by articles over the years, including a Wall Street Journal article entitled "Pooling Resources to Fight Child Abuse and Abduction", the issue of child abduction is personal to Koons.[133][134] Following the end of his marriage to Hungarian-born Italian porn actress Staller in 1994, as she wanted to continue to perform as a porn actress and Koons wanted them to be monogamous, Staller, in violation of a US court order, left with their then-two-year-old son, Ludwig and took the child to Italy.[132][133][135] After Koons spent millions of dollars in legal fees over a five-year period pursuing parental rights to his young son, the Italian Supreme Court failed to recognize the couples' US-based joint custody agreement and instead sided with Staller.[133][134][136]</p>
<p>This loss for Koons led him to establish the Koons Family Institute, and devote over $4.3 million to the International Centre’s work.[134][136] In addition, Koons’ 2010 partnership with Kiehl's to design the artwork for a limited edition moisturizer line raised $200,000 for the Koons Family Institute.[130][134][137]</p>

        <p><p>That is their biggest mistake... she assumed her private server was going to be untouchable because she has been above the law for so long.  </p>
<p>That is the nice thing about the accelerated pace of technology and information sharing.  If you are in the 1980-1999 age group (mix of xers and millenials I think -- labels are stupid) you know more about tech than someone that is Hilldog's age.  And by "know more" I mean we know more about what we don't know to the point where I would never trust a server for sensitive shit no matter how powerful I was.  </p>

        <p><p>I would argue that after 2000, there are too many levels of abstraction from machine code, so that younger generations are actually leveling off in terms of tech-saviness.  Of course there will be another tech-Renaissance (think the 90's) at some point when we move away from silicon based chips/semiconductors, but it has yet to happen.</p></p>

        <p><p>There's already tech in trial for proton transistors. A very small electrical current can reverse the spin of a proton aka 0 or 1. Size advantages aside, the chip would run colder than most ambient temperatures as while the proton is reversing its spin, there's a moment where the particle reaches absolute 0. </p>

        <p><p>This is where I find it all falls down for myself. These are powerful people who seem to be signalling to the pedo world who they are. Then there a pedos who are so down in the darkest holes of the Internet and your telling me these circles have never crossed. That a scum of the earth would not offer security for more access to their pizza. </p>
<p>It's a more crazy to believe that they are so ignorant to the tech world then it is to believe pizzagate is real imo. </p></p>

        <p><p>That's one of my guesses. Can we see the price of some of podestas collection? There could be a trend in size/style that indicates certain works value? A form of currency. I doubt they've began high frequency bitcoin trading, although there is a link between the FBI seizing sr2 and their assets with the huge inflation in value that occurred after. Maybe billions of bitcoin began being moved in their syndicate. </p></p>

        <p><p>I agree and do see the benefit from this, but I think theres an aspect im not grasping.</p>
<p>So, the artist makes the work for free? Say someone had 100k in dirty money, how does art turn that into clean cash? What happens to the person who takes the dirty money?</p></p>

        <p><p>Flexible value too. If some art critic says a $12 piece is worth $40,000, then it is ostensibly worth that. The purveyor of [choose your illegal good / service] just sells a $12 piece of art for $40K, and boom - no suspcious transaction. The guy bought art after all, and that art critic says it's worth what it's worth.</p></p>

        <p><p>That's one of the major points of art. I think most of this subreddit is complete horseshit, but art for money laundering purposes is right on the nose. Not just for this group, for pretty much everyone.</p></p>

        <p><p>For people who don't see how this could work in the context of pedophilia, here's a <em>hypothetical</em> scenario:</p>
<p>Let's say you want to buy CP or illicit services. You go to Comet Pizza (which incidentally has the initials CP) or whatever outlet, and ask the owner. He then says, "if you mention my name to the owner of the art gallery, he'll give you the menu of prices."</p>
<p>So, you go to the gallery. The owner pulls out the price list, and because they're listed as the price of paintings (which cost next to nothing to produce, esp if it's shitty modern art), it looks legit. There can be many permutations, such as buying the original print if you're requesting something expensive, or a simple print if what you want is cheap. You then become an art buyer and your purchase is masked, and the gallery owner (or artist himself) looks legit, too.</p>
<p>This artist then becomes an "investor" in the restaurant as a way to repay the restaurant owner/supplier. Or, the gallery has a cash component which suffices as the cut back to the restaurant operator. </p>
<p>In some cases, the restaurant owner may sell the CP merch back to the artist for an upfront lump sum, ideally in cash but if not, then under some phony vendor receipt/contract like "payment for hosting an event." Unlike cash there'd still be taxes, but it's still a sound way to launder the money. It is then the artist's job to sell the material to customers how they wish, all under the guise of, "payment can be made by buying this (overpriced, marked up) print." </p>
<p>And in this particular case, a pizza place offers a more plausible excuse for why kids are present (the production side) than an art gallery, which clearly has the easier vehicle for payments/laundering.</p></p>

        <p><p>That is probably all this is...  money laundering.  If you are about to get caught moving around 100s of millions you might as well muddy the waters so any real evidence is mixed up in articles posted between alien and bigfoot articles on tinfoilhat.com</p></p>
