        <strong>Why satanism?</strong>
        <p><p>Even as a Christian this has called into question my worldview regarding spiritualism, organized religion and matters of the occult. But I keep seeing that for many of you this is where "doubts" of the whole ordeal creep in. It's hard to believe there are people with this inherent desire to hurt children while worshipping mythical creatures.</p>
<p>A couple things to keep in mind:</p>
<p>Cathy O'brein states that "they" picked out her father as an incestuous child pornographer then basically black mailed him into power with offers of immunity. This was not an average person thrust into the political scene and THEN corrupted. He was a perverted worm digger with a 6th grade education that was suddenly making six figures a year and rubbing elbows with the elite.  So how many people does it really take to influence the balance of power with corrupted individuals? The answer is a small handful. One powerful person could be recruiting like minded perverts into power around them. In my opinion this is what is most likely. As I chose to believe even the most horrible person I know could not be coerced into raping and murdering children. At least I hope that to be the case. </p>
<p>But still-why Satanism? Why child sacrifices, black mass, bohemian grove rituals? Well when we are talking about child molesters it's important to keep in mind most of these individuals have perversions that get them off on the power and control that comes along with assaults on children. Is it really that far of a jump to murder? And from murder is it really that far of a jump to corporate meetings where these murders are experienced and indulged in (ew) by multiple people at the same time? </p>
<p>Consider Stanley Kubricks -Eyes Wide Shut. There was nothing inherently mystifying about the rituals themselves. It was just an orgy and (possible) ritual murder that wasn't shown. But to Dr.Bill (Tom Cruise), the knowledge of those rituals is what gave "them" all the power. The fear of who and what was involved and what kind of power they had in his life, family, and work is what drove him (and the viewers) into paranoia. I also believe this to be the case with what is coming out now.</p>
<p>To me this was more evident after watching the Bohemian grove ceremony. It was so corny and "all over the place" as far as what rituals they were combining into the event. It was like a hodgepodge of occult symbolism thrown into one night where I'm guessing a majority of them didn't even know what they were participating in. I'm sure most of them were just there to affirm themselves into this "secret society" of powerful people and stroke their own ego and perversions at the same time.</p>
<p>This is not to say that they don't worship Lucifer- I'm sure some of them do. But the question is whether that gives them any special favor or power in their roles in society. In my opinion- it does not. There is nothing magical or mystical about what goes on behind those closed doors. It is a sick and twisted perversion that happens to play into what has already existed for thousands of years in pagan and polytheistic ritual.</p>
<p>Anyways, that's just my gathering of what's going on. I hope it helps some of you.</p></p>

        <p><p>Good read. As a (wannabe) Christian myself I always kind of shrugged off this stuff until I actually looked into it. The thing is; people worshiping evil and making sacrifices goes far back into history doesn't it? Some things never change I guess.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, and even in the Bible these things (Baal, Moloch) had no power. I believe it was Elijah that tested something like 400 prophets to call down fire in the name of Baal. But nothing happened. One of my favorite stories. </p>
<p>Edit: this is probably why they have to have pyrotechnics for their silly ceremonies </p></p>

<p>The same power structure in pizza gate is the one that was doing sacrifices at Stone Hendge.</p>
<p>DC is actually geographically and mathematically connected to stone Hendge.</p></p>

        <p><p>Ive looked into this stuff since the franklin cover up. The prevailing theory is it is used for multiple reasons. 1 the shock of demonic symbols works for brainwashing purposes and in experiments nothings worked better. 2, so no one believes the child victims and it comes off as crazy. Even if physical evidence. Is present you can use the trauma as a reasob their own testimony cannot be used. 3, black mail for public life. The blackmail of being outted as tied to the occult is damaging enough to ruin someone pr wise but not cause investigation into the real illegal shit. </p></p>

        <p><p>If you're a Christian do you really see Satan as mythical? The fact that there are people hurting kids this way makes a pretty good case for his existence, i think.</p>
<p>Whether they call it Satanism or not (and they don't), what these people do is actually worship beings that they believe will give them power...and you know, it seems to be working for them.</p>
<p>If you're Christian you will identify these worshiped beings with demons and Satan and if you aren't you might call them something else, but the elite DO literally believe in them and their power, and these beings (whether you choose to believe they exist or not) fit every description of a devil.</p>
<p>This aspect of pizzagate is 100% real whether that takes anyone out of their mental comfort zone or not. Whether it clashes with your world view or not. The truth is sometimes very, very ugly and there are thousands of ritual abuse survivours who will tell you so.</p></p>

        <p><p>The devil has no power over God but God gave this world to human domain and humans can choose to hand that domain over to evil. The ruling powers have done that because they believe that they can attain to godhood just like the first lie told to the first humans "you will become like gods." That's the prevailing idealism of the elite.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think it's mostly likely that people in power tend to worship Satan more than people that worship Satan are likely to come into loads of power and riches unexpectedly.</p>
<p>As I said this has really tested my Christian worldview. But there are a few things I know as truth in regards to Satan. One is that he is the ruler of this world two is that he hates all humanity with a passion- whether they worship him or not. If his power is at work it is for his own good not for the good of humans.</p></p>

        <p><p>True, its for his own benefit, or so he thinks. If you want the whole red pill.. the end goal of all of this is to see their pseudo-Messiah rule the world. A global Luciferian theocracy.</p></p>

        <p><p>Lucifer tempted Jesus with rule of the world. Makes me wonder who else, throughout history, has been given the same offer. "Then the devil led Him up to a high place and showed Him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. 'I will give You authority over all these kingdoms and all their glory, for they are mine to give to whom I please. If You worship me, it will all be Yours.' But Jesus replied, 'It is written:'"‘Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.'"(Luke 4:5-8)</p></p>

        <p><p>LaVeyan satanist here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not understanding the jump here. Not all Satanists do this. In my spiritual understanding sacrifices aren't right as you're removing the sacrifice's right to life. It's a whole do whatever you want as long you don't impose deal. So what exactly are those considered who do sacrifices like this?
And yes, I know LaVeyan Satanism has only been around since the 60s but it's still nothing new.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not sure what you're getting at. This is basically the equivalent of someone saying "I'm a catholic but my home church doesn't sacrifice babies and drink their blood". Yeah, it's true- not all satanists sacrifice things nor do all Catholics partake in black mass or touch little kids. But there are people that do in the name of God, Satan, Baal, Molich etc. What they consider themselves while they do it is kind of irrelevant. The fact is-it happens.</p></p>

        <p><p>I guess I'm upset that the most prevalent things you see on Satanism is disgusting things like this. It'd be similar to someone nothing nothing of Christianity except the crusades.</p></p>

        <p><p>I find it suspicious that some people are being so vocal about the need to dismiss the occult connections because it will just make this movement look crazy. I don't know if it's because they are intentionally trying to cover it up or if they really think it's just preposterous. However, we can't ignore the the mound of evidence that connects many of these rings to cult like practices and mental programming. </p>
<p>To be honest, the whole pizzagate investigation looks crazy at first, and it's only after closely analyzing the evidence (both historical and contemporary) that we see something disturbing is going on. If people aren't comfortable with the occult aspect of all of this, then they don't have to go down that rabbit hole. But don't try to convince others that it's all just crazy conspiracy theories and should be ignored. I agree that the occult connections aren't what we should lead with when explaining this investigation to new people, but we do need to have an open dialog about it here and investigate it further.</p></p>
