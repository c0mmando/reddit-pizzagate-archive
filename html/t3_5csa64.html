        <p><p>These aren't necessarily donations or "giving." It shows he either rented the space or hired them for catering. If you're in DC and you want to host a fund-raiser, renting out a pizza place that people like will bring in a good amount of people. </p>
<p>That or he is an 85 year old pedophile who loves pizza!</p></p>

        <p><p>Not really. It's probably steep for a PIZZA place but if you include food, alcohol, and exclusive use of a restaurant that's probably about right. It was also a Friday (March 21, 2014) according to the tax return. You can rent out just a small room (20-50 people) according to the website but my guess is George Soros doesn't need to worry about saving money and would get the entire place.  The place looks massive as well. </p>
<p>There's a small chance he just gave up $11k to have sex with a child. But I would say it's much more likely that he rented out a space to host a party or a fund-raiser.  Is the price justified? Maybe, maybe not. I don't know how DC prices work or how the restaurant looks and feels. It appears to be very hip and artsy, so that could have a higher price. It seems the owner of comet pizza is a big donator to liberal causes so maybe Soros is paying him back by agreeing to an inflated price. </p>
<p>In the end, there are a million justifications for the price outside of pedophilia. This is a very loose thread. </p>
<p>Also - George Soros is a fucking billionaire. Why is he reporting paying to fuck kids on his taxes? If he really wanted to fuck some kids he has a million ways to do it and NONE of those are going to show up on a federal document as an expenditure. </p></p>

        <p><p>That's my issue with all these pedo allegations from the Biden CSPAN tapes to this Soros giving a pizza place $11K thing. If these guys are the super pedo smugglers everyone wants them to be, they wouldn't be needing to do anything on camera or with a paper trail to get their fix. So many conspiracy theories hinge on the idea that these people are clumsy and we're smart enough to catch them and I don't buy that. </p></p>

        <p><p>No a lot hinges on the fact that the buzz comes from exerting your malevolent power in plain sight (with enough plausible deniability to keep you safe). That's a pretty solid argument. Not of course enough in itself but enough to negate - but why wouldn't they do it in complete secrecy. Imagine you are one of the most powerful people on the planet - would you want to have to hide away to do your thing. Also imagine that these actions are energetic. They need to be in someway public for the magic to work.</p>
<p>Let's look at this picture
http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/moving-reason-hillary-clinton-wore-9230587</p>
<p>The purple is so obviously symbolic that even a rag like the Mirror has to report it as symbolic - but gives the reason that the Clintons are advocating unity between dems and republicans. It's of course plausible. May even be the case (although if it is it would be for me a media stunt rather than heart felt). It's also of course the colour of royalty and the occult. </p>
<p>I think many times this sort of exterior and interior (occult) meaning is what TPTB get their rocks off too.</p></p>

        <p><p>Am I missing what else the purple is supposed to stand for? There's a whole documentary out there somewhere about the social science behind political attire colors, so I see the "obvious" reason why she wore purple. I typically don't like assigning alternate theories when the first explanation is so innocently derived. </p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not asking you to believe anything. I'm explaining why hidden in pain sight might be a thing and an example where it could be happening. No one example is going to be convincing otherwise it wouldn't be 'hidden'. However if you take the idea that any simple external reason is sufficient you simply demonstrate how effective such duplicity could be. </p></p>

        <p><p>I'll break this down into 2 parts to make it easier to respond. </p>
<p>1.) The code. The FBI released that document nearly 10 years ago and said there was a code. That is verified and true. However, it doesn't say how prominent it was. There's also a LOT of pedo porn online and lots of pedophiles online.  You would think the codes and symbols would be more prominent on 4chan or other sites where pedos actually lurk if people actually used the secret code. I don't doubt that it's a real code but I do have doubts about it authenticity. </p>
<p>The link to the restaurant is dubious though. Sure, someone linked to Hillary has said the word pizza multiple times and enjoys this restaurant.  But when the secret code is literally "pizza" it's going to be pretty fucking hard to not accidentally use some of it. </p>
<p>2) They are a punk music venue and bar as well as a pizza place. I think artsy/hipster/punk venues are allowed to have weird instagrams. DC is the birth place of punk music. If people want to put pictures of themselves eating pizza naked then they can, it's a weird-o place. That does not make someone a pedophile. </p>
<p>There are 4 legs to this table and they appear to be this: </p>
<p>1.) There is a secret code about pizza and this is a pizza restaurant.</p>
<p>2) They have weird images on their instagram, including pictures of kids. Do kids eat at a pizza restaurant ever or would an older man have friends with kids? Probably not. He must have kidnapped them. </p>

        <p><p>I don't know where it's located (as far as high traffic/low traffic) or how large it is, but 11k to rent out a large restaurant, in a high traffic area, in a high cost-of-living location, on a weekend evening, with full kitchen/bar is entirely reasonable.  You've got to make up for all of the lost revenue, AND all the lost tips AND the inconvenience of all of the staff (because it's likely they are opening early/staying open late for your party because it's not like you're going to kick the billionaire's party out at closing time if they want to stay a bit longer), AND the potential in lost marketing (if someone wants to go there and they find it closed for a private function they might find they like another place better or not think to go to your business next time out of spite).  And then after all that, you're going to be charged a little extra because all of this is going to be on the books and why not?  If you know you are making 9k on an average weekend night, why not see if you can get 11k out of the rich guy?  Worst case he says no and you still make your 9k from average business.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, but you need to look at the other side of this also.  Very few restaurants (if any) will rent out the <em>complete</em> restaurant on the busiest night of the week!  Think about it.  What most will do is reserve a <em>section</em> of the restaurant and close it off.  So, what was this 'party' doing that they felt they needed to close off the entire restaurant?</p>
<p>As someone who worked in the industry for years, this transaction smells to high-heaven, if it was for renting the facilities.</p>
<p>The <em>only</em> way it makes sense is if it were for catering fees offsite.</p></p>

<p>I've never heard of a independent restaurant (which, again, I have no clue if this place is) refusing an offer that was worth their while.  Obviously it's not something they offer, but if a rich guy comes along and wants to rent out his favorite place and overpay for it, literally every business owner is going to take that deal.  </p></p>

        <p><p>I mean, like I said, it's not something they advertise and I doubt it's common but for an independent restaurant, if they are able to make more money doing a private function, they will always do that.  Because money.  It's just logic.  If you can make 8k doing X or 10k doing Y, you're always going to do Y.  </p>
<p>Like I've said, I have no knowledge of this specific restaurant or event, but the notion of "No restaurant would ever shut down for a private party" is laughably myopic.  I've been to plenty of private functions where restaurants/bars/clubs have been bought out for the night.  And, like I said, even if you've never been to a private function held in a public place it's just logic.  If you pay enough money you can have access to an establishment, and 'enough' will always be a function of that business' potential earnings.</p></p>

        <p><p>If I were a billionaire I'd definitely rent out whole restaurants because why the hell not? Doubling their nightly take is pocket change relatively speaking. Even more so considering even an innocuous George Soros party is likely filled with other wealthy people and political operatives </p>
<p>The fact that restaurants tend not to want to rent out the whole place to one party actually gives credibility to claims the $11k was spent on a pizza party</p></p>

        <p><p>I have no idea what the other comments are talking about -- that is a ridiculously high price for renting out a pizza place. I can only imagine that this investigation will implicate many powerful people who could use CTR tactics in a subreddit like this, just sayin'.</p>
<p>Don't be the guy who thinks <em>"Oh look, a lot of people thought that the dude named pizza_shill made an astute comment, and same with the comment agreeing with him! I'm going to ignore the fact that $11k is an astoundingly high price to rent out a pizza place!"</em> Don't be that guy.</p></p>

        <p><p>No, it's not absurd at all. </p>
<p>My place has a max occupancy of 51 people, I.E. It's tiny. </p>
<p>A buyout for us <em>starts</em> at about $3500.00 and goes up from there depending on what other special requests they have. This pizza joint is much, much larger. </p>
<p>The bar I worked at, when we ran a buyout for Sony during ComiCon, they straight up offered 20k as their starting point. </p>
<p>11 Grand sounds about right for a decent sized place on a weekend. </p></p>

        <p><p>Could be wrong, but some of the pics of the interior of this place didn't look conducive to having a party room. Heck it looked like it was takeout only iirc. </p></p>

        <p><p>True true, but that place didn't bring in $11k that day, so that's absurd for him to rent it for that much. </p>
<p>Also, the place if you've seen the images, is very hipster ish, why in earth would an ancient old man choose that place over a nice steak house or Italian restaurant? </p>
<p>Hmm...</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't know.  I'm not a regular on this sub, but I read about "pizzagate" during its early development.  Some of the Podesta emails are really strange, and it seems like they are talking in code at some points, when referencing pizza.  There are also a lot of terms that are allegedly used by pedophiles.  The most compelling evidence was that there are two other businesses near Comet Ping Pong, and all three of them use stylized symbols that are used by pedophile rings according to FBI unclassified documents.  There seem to be <em>a lot</em> of coincidences.  It could be nothing, but I think it might be worth an investigation.</p></p>

        <p><p>I have a theory here.</p>
<p>The reason that he's saying that George Soros gave 11k to Comet Pizza is because of an amount that came from <em>American Bridge 21st Century</em>, a company owned by David Brock.  And then sock gnomes blah blah blah.</p>
<p>My theory is that this is an intentional red herring.  David Brock is the owner of CTR and various other propagandist groups employed by Hillary, and would probably go to lengths to misdirect our attention.  It would make more sense for him to make Comet Pizza look interesting to take attention off of stuff that is actually legitimate.  </p>
<p>As for Soros, I have my doubts of his involvement in everything, but he makes no secret of what he does or intends to do.  There is no doubt a conspiracy behind globalism, we're seeing it exposed before our very eyes.  But I highly doubt that Soros is the secret Illuminati leader behind the scenes.  The people doing this have made mistakes, but they are not dumb.  It would surprise me more if Soros was not being used as a distraction from the truth, after one of their analysts saw his interview on 60 Minutes from 1998.</p></p>

        <p><p>I just wanted you to know how insane you look from outside this subreddit. Nothing from this subreddit makes logical sense but here you are requesting someone be killed. Cool murder fantasy bro.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I just discovered that Marina Abramovic is a lynchpin in this conspiracy and others. As someone who has cursory knowledge of Abramovic's art since the 2000's, this is stupidly hilarious. Is Lady Gaga involved in this too?</p>
<p>Please keep up the great comedic work. Here's something that might help you in your witchhunt.</p>

        <p><p>The fact that you even think a mainstream media outlet will report on something like this shows how ignorant you are to the reality of the world we live in. You can keep checking in to see the progress. But until then, you can keep the negativity to yourself and stop trying to demotivate people from seeking the truth. </p></p>

<p>The tweet that this post links to belongs to a ridiculously anti-semitic dude named "Goy Orbinson" who is obsessed with pro-white bullshit. So, if you want to get this to MSM, maybe you shouldn't be letting closeted white-supremacists lead the charge :D</p>

        <p><p>You do know that the Pope spent his time  volunteering in Argentina. How is that white supremacist?</p>
<p>If you're talking about fox news? How is the fact that they are biased any different from the other newsgroups? All the newsgroups are effectively ignoring the fact that trump now has 309 electoral votes. Google is stuck on 290.https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=Donald+trump+electoral&amp;eob=enn/p//0/0///////////</p>
<p>In fact, I expect, beyond a doubt, that the real supremacists are the ones who would let rioting occur for over seven days over a perfectly legal election and refuse to say a word. Hillary Clinton has not tweeted for nine days, not even to denounce the riots. Donald Trump has told rioters to stop destroying property. Hillary? Nope. https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor</p>
<p>In fact, she seems more interested in staging things for good publicity and playing the blame game than actually doing her civic duty and telling people who could very well be her supporters to knock it off. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3929382/Was-Hillary-hiking-woods-photo-staged-Woman-picture-met-Clinton-fundraiser-family-hosted-ex-candidate.html</p></p>

        <p><p>A lot of stuff referenced on here makes sense. Unfortunately, there are also a large number of incensed morons banging on about cutting people's balls off for renting a restaurant for the evening.</p>
<p>It tarnishes the whole thing somewhat.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't think Abramovic is a lynchpin. The whole 'spirit cooking' thing is a performance art piece that the Christians on here got scared by.</p>
<p>What I hold to be valid pieces of information are the leaked Podesta emails, symbolism used by various involved parties, and content uploaded to social media.</p></p>

        <p><p>It must be this Jeffrey Epstein pedophile fella then, right? </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/">"I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,'' Trump booms from a speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life."</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this sub going to start accusing Trump of being part of the pedophilia ring too?</p></p>

        <p><p>Considering Trump and Epstein are the only ones that have been charged in court about it, Trump would probably end up being found as a lot more than an accomplice. I was skeptical about the person who <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/06/23/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit/">accused Trump of raping her when she was 13</a>, but this sub is really starting to lend credence to it.</p></p>

        <p><p>I thought this video didn't paint him in all bad light. </p>
<p>And I did not know that he escaped the holocaust. 
Very interesting video</p>
<p>Edit: lemme just say I'm not saying he isn't a bad dude but I am saying this video wasn't very in your face anti soros either. </p>
<p>And the holocaust part was very interesting. </p></p>

        <p><p>Soros did not 'escape' the holocaust!  In fact, he HELPED the Nazis during the war, outing fellow Jews, supposedly.  Don't remember where I read this, but it's available if you search for it.</p>
<p>But, 'escape the holocaust'?? If anything he contributed to it.  In fact, he's on record as saying in his 'memoirs', that it was the 'most exciting time in his life'????</p></p>

        <p><p>In this video he says that he was forced to do so. And that it "defined who his is today"</p>
<p>Which is a bad person who is detached emotionally. I can see how being forced to out your fellow countrymen could do that to you. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, sorry, but if you read his memoirs and then watch the things he has done for the last 30+ years, this is a man who needs to be in prison for causing pain, misery and suffering in the world.  Of course, by that definition, most of the US Gov't should also be in prison...</p></p>

        <p><p>Paul Town. He's a former Comet Pizza employee who had shared a revealing pic on his IG account.. naked man with a slice of pizza on his genitals and a bottle of honey (img can be seen here https://youtu.be/GtuY-JRdiG8?t=1551, at around 25:50 mark). Just today Paul Town tweeted along with a pic of Podesta: "tfw you will never have a 🍕 party in the white house", as well as a very creepy "BRB PIZZA PARYY🐇🐰🍕". Still up for anyone to see.

        <p><p>This is a compilation of many different links, including links to suspicious emails etc... https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cr74l/pizzagate_link_compilation/ 
Another option is to look up youtube videos. The one referred up above is decent, has most of the info. This is some fucked up shit.

        <p><p>well, that's a doozy. thanks for the links. I'm kind of looking for something shorter, a summary of the most important links between everything. There was a thread on here im trying to find but i can't seem to find it. </p>
<p>That's kind of the problem with stuff like this is, it's like everything i can find is either too much or not enough information haha.  People don't have the patience to wade through all that stuff or watch a 45 minute video - if you want the masses to be able to take this in it needs to be digestible. I know my gf wont have the patience for that. But again, thanks, I'm reading through this now.</p></p>

        <p><p>The purpose for the $11,600 disbursement was listed as "Catering and Facility Rental".</p>
<p>The date of the disbursement: 21 March 2014, three days after Russia's annexation of Crimea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soros was present at a post-coup meeting on March 21, 2014 that involved US support for the New Ukraine. One document describes the New Ukraine as a key measure to reshape the European map by offering the opportunity to go back to the original essence of European integration.
