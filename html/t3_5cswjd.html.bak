        <strong>Guys please please PLEASE archive your links with archive.is or other BEFORE posting. We're in danger of losing evidence.</strong>
        <p><p>It's super easy: Just go to http://archive.is and paste in the URL to archive, click the button. It'll forward to a new archive page with the archive link in the URL bar. Just copy it out and paste in your comment. All the pics and txt on the page will be archived.</p>
<p>(Not video though. Use http://www.ssyoutube.com to archive youtube vids to local. Or I like Jdownloader2)</p>
<p>Or drag their button to your bookmark toolbar and it'll do that for you.</p>
<p>This should be done with ALL WEBPAGES OR PICS <strong>BEFORE POSTING</strong>. The danger is, obviously, that a Bad Guy will see the evidence online and wipe their site, server, or account. Then we're fucked.</p>
<p>edit: ALSO SAVE TO YOUR COMPUTER in case archive.is gets borked. Be sure to save the COMPLETE PAGE, not just HTML, so you get all the pics.</p>
<p>I realize this will be uncomfortable for many. You have a choice to make.</p></p>

        <p><p>Do NOT only use archive.is for this. Save material on your COMPUTER TOO! You never know when that website might get taken down. Never depend on online services, aspecially not with a case like this.</p></p>

        <p><p>What's worse is that a current archive can be saved over with a new one. </p></p>
