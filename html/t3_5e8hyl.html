        <p><p>Two fat fucks and a cat is what composes Snopes's research team, remember that. Also, I just debunked Snopes for being a government mouthpiece for disinformation. If people stop talking about them and referring to them in any way, they'll disappear as fast as their allegedly credibility.</p></p>

        <p><p>Snopes uses "factcheck.org" as their source of reference. Factcheck.org is largely influenced by the government organisation "Stratfor". I wouldn't trust Snopes. (Go to Wikileaks.org, type in "stratfor" "factcheck") You'll see over 60 pages of emails discussing the use of Factcheck ("factcheck the shit out of this", etc.) (try to go to the earliest pages.)</p></p>

        <p><p>These numpties just think with whatever their key idea sites tell them to think. </p>
<p>They're going to run to fact check next? Or CNN? All that clearly demonstrated bias to Clinton during the election instead of remaining objective? </p>
<p>You can't beat the insular environment they operate in.  These nutjobs genuinely believe that RUSSIA helped Wikileaks and Trump because that's what the idea progenitor of their echo chamber says. 
They also believe trump is the next Hitler because of the FUD stirred up by biased media interests with conflicts of interest. </p>
<p>I'm not saying the "alt right" is infallible in its reasoning, as there's plenty of propaganda on that end, too. </p>
<p>To make light of child exploitation shows you the general moral relativism of the left.  They care more about their narcissistic sphere of consumption than they do about suffering of other people.   Don't fuck with their pizza joints, man.  That's where they go to pick up girls, HUHHUHUH.</p>
<p>Fucking pathetic degenerates.</p></p>

        <p><p>My favorite part:</p>
<p>"Now, there is obviously some weird stuff in there, but I really think these people are starting to go crazy!! One of the supposedly inappropriate pictures they pull from James Alefantis' instagram is of a smiling girl with her hands taped down to a table. Yeah that's weird but, can that not just be a really innocent game? Like just picking on a little kid?"</p>

        <p><p>Keep in mind that Snopes basically works for the U.S. government. If they don't already they might as well be collecting paychecks from them. Don't believe anything on this site ever under any circumstance and I promise you they are going to label pizzagate as false so everyone on r/politics can spread it around and call everyone "alt-right conspiritards".</p></p>
