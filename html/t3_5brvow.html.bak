        <strong>Another Connection in the neighborhood. I haven't seen any mention of Politics and Prose.</strong>
        <p><p>https://www.google.com/maps/@38.9554688,-77.0701022,3a,15y,83.78h,88.36t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s0-tiSgOn-MJLr6hd2YBmyg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1</p>
<p>Maybe I missed the connection before but this place in the same lot is owned by Hillary Clinton's former Speechwriter from her time as First Lady, Lissa Muscatine, and her husband, 15 years at the Washington Post, Bradley Graham. Haven't discovered any oddities yet as I just found this. Dig Dig. </p>
<p>Also, because I know how things go, the logo is a fox, not an owl. </p>

        <p><p>Also, they use Authorize.net which if you look at the reviews seems to be a total scam. Lots of complaints of money blatantly being not refunded, overcharges, really strange policy like you have to call a specific day of the year in order to cancel.
"Politics &amp; Prose uses Authorize.Net, a leading payment gateway since 1996, which provides the latest technology to keep your credit card information safely encrypted on a secure server; and we are registered with the Authorize.Net Verified Merchant Seal program. The Authorize.Net Payment Gateway adheres to strict industry standards for payment processing, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>128-bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology for secure Internet Protocol (IP) transactions.</li>
<li>Industry leading encryption hardware and software methods and security protocols to protect customer information.</li>
<li>Compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)."</li>
</ul>
<p>EDIT: Authorize.net is owned by Cybersource, which I found has made large to donations to Hillary for America, over $500,000. This could be a scam payment service that steals money from actual small businesses looking to use it, and of course actually works with the Politics and Prose website.
