        <strong>This is from at FAQ area of a survivorship web site. Interesting In light of all the UFO talk in the emails and all the suspected Hollywood involvement/child actors etc. Link to source in comments</strong>

        <p><p>I want to say this about that reference to screen memory: compare this to false memory syndrome, a manufactured diagnosis specifically created to discredit victims. </p>
<p>Though memories can be implanted, take my word for it they are not covering something else with Satanic ritual memories. They may cover occult memories with completely innocuous recollections such as "i ate  pizza last night" as opposed to "i was the pizza last night".</p>
<p>There is and always has been an extremely concerted effort to hide the occult element, but i promise you that it is not only a very central element to all this, it is THE CORE reason it goes on.</p></p>
