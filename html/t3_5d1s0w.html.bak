        <strong>Possible Bombshell! Most "PNG" Attachments in Podesta emails contain encrypted text files. Just cracked one after decrypting font. Contents seem Extremely confidential. Translated directly from chinese, Grammar is off due to direct translation.</strong>
        <p><p>Dear Moderator: DumbScribblyunctious, you did not message me regarding post. You closed comments when discussion was not out of hand.</p>
<p>You decided that you had authority to close discussion because this was "Fucking Stupid"</p>
<p>I am done posting to this channel as it seems to have people who essentially step in front of you to tell you that is  not the path we want to take this investigation, you lead us no where.</p>
<p>Before I could even provide everyone with my step by step of how I came to this, you closed discussion. </p>
<p>No one knows how I pulled it, or from where. I was given no chance for you to discredit. </p>
<p>Thanks for the equal opportunity!</p>
<p>I will be providing all of my experience and solo investigation at a different host. </p>
<p>thanks for silencing a contributor. </p></p>

        <p><p>You would see the same kind of thing for any random data interpreted as unicode and translated from Chinese. If you interpreted it as UTF8 instead of UTF16 you would see nonsense strings of English characters too.</p>
<p>Good effort -- it's not unlikely some of the attachments contain something, but it would seem unlikely we'll have any luck decrypting them. You'd need to identify candidate image/video/audio files, the steganographic tool they used, and then bruteforce the password.</p></p>

        <p><p>Should be at the top.</p>
<p>How hard would it be, if possible, to identify separate candidate files.</p>
<p>Is there some way to make an educated guess to which tools they use? Like any guess as to how many different tools there are out there, and which ones may be common in government? (ones sold by defense companies perhaps)</p></p>

        <p><p>I wrote like 5 in my lifetime, 3 of which openly available. Therefore i can only conclude that there are thousands of tools. Most of which dont leave any traces to which tool was used. There is no need for government approved tools or anything because you can just build those on proven technologie. (Like simple using AES and follow through a specific pixel changing tactic.)</p></p>

        <p><p>In my opinion the best way to accomplish this is to pool all similar image files, look at signal features, use these as a training set (hopefully large enough) for a machine learning algorithm between the same photos (if available on the web), hopefully come up with a model for deviations in signal features from the original and determine if this model matches any known steganographic methods.  Then we can use the right software to desteg them.  I assume there are other people doing this as we speak (if the dos attack on 4chan holds any water).  If you do not have the tools to carry out the steganalysis then the best way to contribute is reverse image search any of the images you find.  As for the png files that are not images, it is a shot in the dark.  What do you compare it to?  I think we are on the right track, as far as suspecting that the content of these emails are suspicious, but there is no easy solution for decrypting any of these things a priori.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Mind sharing the entire text in Chinese before your translation? We could find someone who speaks the language to do a more thorough revision of the message. Amazing find, nonetheless.</p>
<p>Edit: hijacking top comment to inquire as to how exactly you arrived to this message and how we can reproduce it. And off topic, another important conspiracy which should have eyes on it is the disappeareance of Assange. Exploit libtards' progressiveness and "empathy", get #RIPAssange trending on Facebook and Twitter. Nobody will care that Assange is actually important, they'll just go like "oh, somebody I haven't heard of died, let me post something to show I care". And people might actually educate themselves on the topic when it's all over social networks.</p></p>

        <p><p>Please, let's keep the name-calling (i.e., "libtard") to a minimum if we can. I ask this because the delineation between a "D" and an "R" is illusory, given that the fake two-party system has been foisted upon us. It's a con that works well. We as a populace spend more time arguing between ourselves and less (or no) time on the pedocabal. </p>

        <p><p>Like opening a image in a text editor assuming you have found hidden text?</p>
<p>Seriously, if you would have included what you have done in your OP, or even answered to a single time someone asked i would not mind. But coming up with this, while obviously having no idea is just a bad attitude.</p>
<p>Its cool that you try and learn and stuff, but again. Mention how you've done it so somebody can come by and tell you why you are doing it wrong. That is how actual learning works.</p>
<p>Edit:// BTW! I am not mad at you at all! I really appreciate people getting into this stuff, i am more annoyed by this sub upvoting this long after multiple comments explain that its obviously nothing.</p></p>

        <p><p>I find it interesting that some of the names we can translate are Unavem iii, (Angola peacekeeping mission), Boao Forum, (non profit Asian business think tank),  etc. I think this might be important and crucial info regarding the CF. Great find.</p></p>

        <p><p>... w. T. F. Which email was this associated with? And I agree with posts prior- there's gotta be a Pede (or someone) who can translate the text as you originally found it.   ... we're the emojis there ? So weird.  Maybe that's a translation creation? </p></p>

This would enable more people to do it as t hey are looking at other leads and also to verify your work and look at it from another angle.</p></p>

        <p><p>The text mentions Russian gang involved and I'm starting to believe it from some of the other websites I found. </p>
<p>This is from my other post, and i saw websites identical to the investhk.com.
Part 1 The creator of pipto.com is lassejensen.gmail.com found his email in this seemingly secret conversation with others: http://archive.is/3Q2D4#selection-2007.45-2185.4 I also found this http://domainbigdata.com/nj/DlYRmhB0q1wurK-AV2S1cQ that shows all the domain names that are registered to lasse jensen. One of the website's spiked my intrest was called bestsexprice.com which is apparently offline.
Part 2 I typed in "bestsexprice" into google and the first thing that popped up was an interesting site called flagsworld.ru/directorycfo which link you to directorycfo.com as well as other possible websites. -These websites seem to be a market place of sorts.. links to this guys twitter- https://twitter.com/PeteGouldSocial?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw
Part 3 - Forgot how I came to this, but its the most disturbing so far. http://successfulmarketing4u.blogspot.com/ and it is how I reached this website: http://archive.is/wYDPS -look at "Family Vacation are Fun" shit even the creepy fucking van too... but that directed me to this other website for child prostitution in vietnam (I believe). http://archive.is/LXzVn why does it make you choose child as infant or children, and the price only changes when you add a child/infant to your cruise but doesnt change with another adult.
Part 4 Using http://spyonweb.com/jkdstreetdefense.com I went to adatravel.net, which is in the same IP address as jkd website which sends you to the vietnam cruise. I found a document on google that had the adatravel email address, hwallace@adatravel.net. Finally this lead me to http://www.universal-spanish.com/children.html which I believe to be the similar to the vietnam cruise but for mexico. To try to further prove my theory I looked up the universal-spanish address on google maps. Right next door to the business there was a sign with a heart and a baby in the middle of it. https://www.google.com/maps/@18.9212806,-99.2415729,3a,66.6y,237.94h,75.4t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1snng2HV57PQsDjT6VK8bhug!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1
OH and fucking Ping pong !!!!! http://www.universal-spanish.com/activities.html</p>

        <p><p>If I had to take a stab at any coherency in this, I would say it has more to do with money in politics... I just looked up Vincent Fang and the two results I'm seeing are both liberal Hong Kong politicians. With the repeated mention of bank or other monetary terms, it would appear this to be scandalous in a pay-to-play sense, but probably not pizza-related.</p>
<p>When translating Asian characters in a batch like this, mixed with the Wingdings and other characters, it's not going to look pretty or make sense in certain cases. Some of these "words" are reliant on other syllables to make any kind of sense. For example, in Korean, "strawberry" can be poorly translated to "daughter machine."</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't think it's Chinese, because there are lots of different characters. It could be any kind of data, which falsely interpreted as unicode text would always look quite like this.</p>
<p>There are lots of Chinese characters in the unicode table, so the chance of something being interpreted as a Chinese character is much higher than a character of our alphabet that only uses 26 letters.</p></p>

        <p><p>It doesn't translate correctly bc it is a mix of languages.  Chinese, japanese, Korean and Arabic from what I can ascertain.  Only have access to mobile so I have no way of hashing this out but, can someone try to separate the languages and the translate each independently? </p></p>

        <p><p>If it helps, it is just completely random gibberish. If something was hidden in the image, its not that. See the other comments for the explaination.</p></p>

        <p><p>how the fuck is this random gibberish that is this uncommon? Bro they are fucking talking about defaults on a security company! buying subs, and various international agencies. Ill double check on the validity of this later for myself. If this is fake it is extremely elaborate.....</p></p>

        <p><p>Try what he has (most likely) done with any image. Google (or whatever translator he used) Is trying really hard to give this remotely sense, thats why some things may sound like actual sentences. Do you know the theoretical story about the unlimited monkeys on typewriters and one will at some point end up writing the bible? This is that.</p></p>

        <p><p>Holy. Shit. Boys. </p>
<p>We are on the path of Chinese nationals cloning Nazi scientists who were searching for the Holy fuckin Grail? </p>
<p>We are way out of our league here, fellas. </p>
<p>If only there was someone we could call.  Someone who was better at cyber. </p>
<p>Boys, we need Barron. </p>
<p>If we're going to be tangling with cloned Nazi scientists and ancient Chinese mythology we need a cyber expert.  </p>
<p>Seriously, this is getting ridiculous. </p>
<p>You're losing people who were on board not even a week ago. </p>
<p>Can we just go back to when it was a few autists on the chans investigating this? </p>
<p>Member how fun that was?</p>
<p>Member how real it felt like it might be? </p>
<p>I member ):</p></p>
