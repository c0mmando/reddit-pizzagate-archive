        <p><p>Again, to play devils advocate, if someone started falsely accusing or correctly accusing my company of being a pedo den based on the logo, I'd change it too.  All it means is that they know what people are saying.</p>
<p>As an example, I have a friend who used to work for a language school called ISIS.  They changed their name last summer.</p>
<p>They weren't connected.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes but there are a lot of new people that are learning about this.  I don't think it really hurts. It's still on topic. Just older news to some of us</p></p>

        <p><p>Advocate for the devil: If I had a business that was implicated in any form of inappropriate sexual activity such as this, even a logo causing implication, I'd issue a statement in some facet. Everything has been fixed on the dl and no one has said the accusations are false, they are just hanging there. And many people have been going there causing a ruckus. </p></p>

        <p><p>People are gonna argue that if they got heat about it theyd change it, and it's true, but you would also make some sort of PR statement being transparent about the change and it wouldn't seem weird at all.</p></p>
