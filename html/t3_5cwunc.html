        <strong>Lovettesville Ranch house, Podesta emails</strong>
        <p><p>Has anyone noticed that the lovettesville ranch house that's is in the Podesta emails has no pool. They mentioned the kids were going to be "swimming" on goggle maps there is no pool. Also Zillow and other realtor pages show that there is no pool! </p></p>

        <p><p>Do you have the wrong address? Maybe I did. But I looked into this last week and zillow was stating the house had a pool, and what looked like a covered pool on google earth.</p>

        <p><p>You're making big claims without any evidence. You need to provide links to Zillow or google maps, while also showing that the property is in fact the same one as referenced in the email. There was already a similar post to this one, and no evidence was provided</p></p>

        <p><p>Good work, detective. It's suspicious that the OP just created their account, and this all they've posted. It feels like they're trying to spread disinformation/misinformation. If rumors like this pick up steam, then it just helps to discredit all of the other good research people are doing. </p>
<p>This is how the media is able to hush up scandals. They will claim how preposterous it all is and then show all of the weak and flawed evidence supporting it (while ignoring the strong evidence). People who don't do their own research will then accept the media's spin at face value and not look into it further.</p></p>

        <p><p>Your right. That's why I fact check what I find here. It's a shame we can't trust others, but that's why we're all here digging in the first place, right?</p>
<p>All that to say, there may be more to this farm and some of the findings. Anything can be a link, a trail, something to chase.. But this is why we search.</p></p>

        <p><p>So, I dug a bit more.. Found a better image.. Is that actually a covered pool, I can't tell? Every image I found on this site dating back to 2010 has the "cover on" the pool, I can't confirm seeing the water. heh. </p>
