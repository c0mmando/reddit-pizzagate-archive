        <strong>Where is the evidence that the McCann sketch is based on more than one suspect? I'm sick of people claiming it is, not providing evidence, and then downvoting those who doubt their claim.</strong>

        <p><p>And on top of that, why would the Podesta brothers themselves carry out the kidnapping. Sounds way too risky for people that have so much to lose and have supposedly been involved in child abduction for a long time.</p></p>

        <p><p>Consider the parents were loaning their daughter out to elites to be raped after she had been drugged and left home alone for these elites to use her. Suppose they decided to just take her, knowing full well the McCanns wouldn't be able to point out who did it without implicating themselves. It would explain why the mother screamed "They've taken her!" when she discovered that Madeleine was gone.</p></p>

        <p><p>Interesting. I'm definitely all for speculating but the number of people here who keep claiming things as evidence just because someone else has spouted the same shit is disheartening.  </p>
<p>I feel like there really could be something to this pizzagate business but we're impatient and coming up with spurious links that make us appear as crazies.</p></p>

        <p><p>Maybe, but unless you've lost a child in such a way you have no idea what the normal reaction is. Imagine the panic of realizing your child has been taken, anyone who says they would be able to think clearly and rationally is deluded.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, like you said, this is all speculation. I'm taking the approach of basically turning this into two cases. One in which the parents are guilty and one where they aren't. It's the only way, to me, to really rationally explain how she disappeared. </p></p>

        <p><p>I hear that theory a lot, and it makes sense. If it weren't for the Podesta brothers matching the efits, I would go with that explanation. There's debate about whether the efits are the same person, but the distinct mole above Tony's eye, and the weight differences between both efits gives me pause to chalk it up to that theory.</p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>E-fits of men police want to trace (Top row l-r): Sighted at 22:00 carrying girl; Seen near McCanns' apartment; Charity collector; (Bottom row l-r) Different image of man sighted at 22:00; Seen near McCanns' apartment; Seen in Ocean club resort on 3 May </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two sketches in question are top and bottom left. It only says the bottom is it is a different image of the man sighted at 10pm</p></p>

        <p><p>Because it says...<em>top left to right, bottom left to right</em>. Guess which efits are on bottom left and top left?!  </p>
<p>And then goes on to say that these two efits are based on the same 22:00 sighting. Have you read nothing I've posted?</p></p>

        <p><p>The leading theory of which is about a gang of thieves. </p>
<p>Regardless, you're missing the point. No one is disputing there are multiple suspects. </p></p>

<p>As you say, they released six efits. Two of these efits are of discussion on this subreddit and per that article you linked, are believed to be of the same person. The other efits are based on different testimony and are not believed to be of the same man and are not believed to be the Podesta brothers.</p></p>

        <p><p>I missed the part in the article that said "they are not believed to be the podesta brothers" Where does it say the name podesta in the atricle for you to verify that?</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm talking about the four efits that aren't being used by pizza gate from that article. The key word I used was <strong>other</strong>. Is anyone here claiming that those other four efits are the podesta's?  </p>
<p>I said they're not believed to be the podesta's as I'm yet to see someone claim the other four efits are the podesta's.   </p>
<p>Just to make sure you get the point, here is the image of the six efits: http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/410/media/images/70493000/jpg/_70493984_untitled-1.jpg. </p>
<p>I said that the other four, I.e. the four not in question here, are not believed to be the podesta's. Can you show me a claim that says otherwise?</p></p>

You filed to mention that the article released 6 e-fits. </p></p>

        <p><p>No I didn't, that's in my last quote above. Additionally, that quote relates specifically to the two efits of discussion on this subreddit:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Police, who outlined their latest findings in the search for Madeleine on the BBC One's Crimewatch, released two e-fits of a man <strong>seen carrying a child in Praia da Luz at 22:00</strong> on the night Madeleine went missing.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Relate that to the quote from earlier:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>E-fits of men police want to trace (Top row l-r): <strong>Sighted at 22:00 carrying girl</strong>; Seen near McCanns' apartment; Charity collector; (Bottom row l-r) <strong>Different image of man sighted at 22:00</strong>; Seen near McCanns' apartment; Seen in Ocean club resort on 3 May  </p>

        <p><p>Right so 2 e-fits are of the same person. There are 6 e-fits. Nowhere does it state all 6 of these e-fits are of the same person. </p></p>
