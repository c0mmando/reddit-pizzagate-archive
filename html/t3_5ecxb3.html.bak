        <strong>Children's Hospital Las Angeles :(</strong>
        <p><p>I was thinking about other big families and 
looking into their ties, this goes deeper 
than Paris Hilton... but this is how I found a possible
pedo link.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hilton is listed on the "First Families" of 
the Children's Hospital Los Angeles, which 
means she has donated US$100,000 or more to 
the hospital.[289] In 2008, a room at the 
CHLA was named in her honor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Look at their logo :( - non-profit that is 
mainly private funded.</strong></p>

<p>The Saban Research Institute</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Saban Research Institute of Children’s 
Hospital Los Angeles is among the largest 
and most productive pediatric research 
centers in the western United States. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Hospital_Los_Angeles</p>
<p>Funded by Haim Saban</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Originally established in 1992, The 
Children’s Hospital Research Institute 
became The Saban Research Institute in 2003 
following a $40 million gift in support of 
pediatric research made by Cheryl Saban, 
PhD, <strong><em>Haim Saban</em></strong> and the Saban Family 
Foundation.</p>

<p>Who bought his way into government, particularly the Clinton-era government</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the Clinton administration, the 
entertainment executive served on the 
President's Export Council, advising the 
White House on trade issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are very good friends</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" Saban remains close friends with the former President. Clinton described Saban as a "very good friend and supporter."[5] Saban contributed between $5 million to $10 million to the William J. Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>This is just my initial peel back of the 
hospital.  I am sure there is plenty more to 
find unfortunately...</p></p>
