        <p><p>Jeffrey Epstein is a sick fucking pedophile who even has a criminal record for it.  His butler released this book of his clients and was murdered after.</p>
<p>Does anyone know where to find a non-redacted version? Dark web maybe?</p>
<p>Also researchers please start cross referencing this book to Pizza Gate suspects/pedophiles.</p></p>

        <p><p>Some notable names I found, probably missed a lot: Rupert Murdock, Courtney Love, Peter Soros (George Soro's nephew), Kevin Spacey, Ivana,  Ivanka &amp; Donald Trump, John Kerry, Tony Blair, David Blaine.</p></p>

        <p><p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/52046">Doug Band</a> is also on the list and then a shitload of other Clinton Foundation employees beneath his name. </p>
<p>More importantly, Bill Clinton's phone number is in there at the bottom of Doug Band's entry ("no. 42 do not use")</p></p>

        <p><p>How did you find this?  I don't think it matters if it's redacted. We don't need the phone numbers to read the names.</p>
<p>Awesome score. I'm really curious what lead you to it. Thanks.</p></p>

        <p><p>Research.  Known about it for a long time.  Enjoy.  If someone could make a list of names and paste here that would be awesome!</p></p>

        <p><p>check out pg 91 and 92</p>
<p>under massage-
(GM really likes)
(GM still to try)</p>
<p>another note on this page says (sec gov agent)</p>
<p>and the last page the massage girls in CA one says (courtney love's)
her contact info is also in the book and circled. </p>
<p>Other names circled include his known slaves and others accused of pedophilia like Alan Dershowitz. </p>
<p>To me the best leads are actually the listing for his other apartments- who are these employees, who else wants to talk?  </p></p>

        <p><p>Hmmm, I have found Ted Kennedy's son in there, Ted Kennedy Jr (page 30), who currently works at "Epstein Becker &amp; Green". A law firm for health services. Dont know if relevant, but there's definitely connections to the Kennedy family.</p></p>
