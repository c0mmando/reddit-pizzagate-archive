        <strong>[Serious] Recent Influx of Downvotes</strong>
        <p><p>I noticed that within a time frame of only a few hours nearly every front page r/pizzagate post has either dropped by 100 or the upvote score isn't even showing. Any info Mods?</p></p>

        <p><p>We are being hit hard with vote fuzzing.  Use your brain and critical thinking to figure out who is shilling and what is legit.  MAKE SURE TO CHECK https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/new/ as much as you check top posts.  There is going to be some post the shills do not want to hit the front page and other post they do want.  The votes are about to be compromised.  Pizza gate is exploding and they are fucking scared. I have been watching things unfold and we are up against a big shill army ( Probably 100 people sitting in the white house behind computers shitting their pants ).</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree with the need to have people dedicated to downvoting the shills while ALL OF US upvote the real leads. We need to keep power of our sub by having a good mod team like we did with the_donald</p></p>

        <p><p>Mods are being added as the sub is gaining ground. When this was only a few hundred subscribers it wasn't difficult, but now it's nearly up to 6,000 it's getting difficult to handle. I haven't added any mods myself, but /u/pizzathrowaway777 was adding mods as he started the subreddit and he's picking mods he feels are credible/trustworthy. But we can't rely on just mods, all the subscribers need to help counter any shills/vote manipulation. We are only human after all. This shit gets very very tiring to try to stay on top of. Especially since it's growing so damn quickly. </p></p>

        <p><p>I see.  Well lets hope for the best and thanks for the post.  Mods can be compromised, blackmailed, or even killed on something like this just over an account.  We must keep an eye out on that.  More mods = higher chance of compromised sub.</p></p>

        <p><p>You're right, and it's something we're (I hope) all aware of. It's still a work in progress trying to find that balance between a reasonable number of trustworthy mods, keeping everyone safe, and keeping the sub on the right tracks while avoiding compromise. </p></p>

        <p><p>I haven't been down voting, but I made a plea to keep quiet. They're destroying evidence while this gains ground. I was banned for it, then the ban lifted after I plead my case. </p>
<p>I don't want to openly dissent because I also want justice, but after besta changed logos and now the risqué posters are coming down in comet, we should seriously think about being quieter. They just have too much time to cover up the hard evidence that's going to be needed to convict.</p>
<p>I feel this sub was too hasty. We should have developed a code to keep our digging quiet. We don't need America to know, we need official investigators to gather evidence. Ask a lawyer how difficult it would be to convict politicians of these charges on suspicion and circumstantial evidence alone. </p>
<p>Digging is great and all, but telling our enemies everything we find is just dumb.</p>
<p>Us: We know you're raping kids and we're gonna tell everyone! We know you have people in the DOJ covering you for the next two months, but everyone will know!</p>
<p>Them: (takes a week to destroy all evidence) What are you talking about? What kids?</p></p>
