        <strong>The Republicans have been shifting through the Clinton's lives for almost Two Decades, if there was anything to find they would have been screaming it through megaphones all this time</strong>
        <p><p>Seriously you people honestly think two of the most scrutinized people in modern history could hide a fucking child sex ring!</p>
<p>The entire world knew within a year that Bill fucked the secretary, if they were raping kids we would have known years ago!</p></p>

        <p><p>The whole reason this is on the scale that it is is that it's a massive cover up and I'm sure some republicans are involved in it as well. This is not a partisan fight, this is a fight to stop pedophiles who have all the power in the world</p></p>

        <p><p>this isn't a republican/democrat thing...and frankly if you think it is then that tells me you've done ZERO research into this...it's an elite occult power thing. Kinda like how Kerry-D and Bush- R both refuse to talk about skull and bones</p></p>

        <p><p>From a casual observers stand point. They did get away with a lot over the years. How long did it take people to catch on to the Clinton foundation.</p>
<p>This post does not reflect my opinion on what is going on with this. Just making a point.</p></p>

<p>I don't wanna give you any ideas, but these are really bad childish arguments. You literally sound like Hillary, and we all feel a certain way about her.</p></p>
