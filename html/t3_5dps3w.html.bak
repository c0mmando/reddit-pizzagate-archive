        <strong>How the election was won. Palantir: The scrying stone of power responsible for Trump's success. (And how pizzagaters can be brought to justice)</strong>
        <p><h1>How the election was won.</h1>
<p><strong>Palantir:</strong> The scrying stone of power responsible for Trump's success. </p>
<p>The story begins with two emails I uncovered on Wikileaks. The first is from Haim Saban, an Egyptian born, Israeli-American media magnate and one of Hillary Clinton's top donors, sent to John Podesta in summer 2015.</p>
<p>Re: A potential break through technology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you familiar with Dr Alex Karp of Palantir? They’re the real deal in identifying various group of people and Alex is an eccentric genius. The various security and intelligence agencies use their services. He was asked multiple times to work with various campaigns, but in a conversation I had with him yesterday,he stated that he would make only ONE exception: HRC. Your call but worth checking it out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Podesta's reply.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Know him pretty well. Agree and will reach out. Thanks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/57524</p>
<p>Podesta did indeed know him well. As the following email update on Chelsea Clinton's activities sent to donors of the Clinton Global Initiative on September 21, 2014 attests (possibly a coincidence, but notice the date, the autumnal equinox)</p>
<p>A Chelsea Update</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Continuing her obsession with data, Chelsea has led an effort to look at the lifetime of every CGI commitment over the past 10 years and figure out what can we learn from the commitments that worked, and what can we learn from the ones that didn't. With the help of Palantir, CGI is planning to release special report that examines this data and looks at what characteristics lead to the most successful CGI commitments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>So what is Palantir?</strong></p>
<p>In short, it is a piece of software that adds a simple user friendly interface to the modified version of Inslaw's <strong>PROMIS.</strong></p>
<p>The intelligence agencies needed a way to search their own and each other's databases, but they also needed to restrict access, so only those with the proper security clearances could see certain streams of data. Enter Peter Thiel and Alex Karp, PayPal's creators. The algorithm used by PayPal became the standard in electronic financial clearing because it could rapidly assess transactions and detect fraud in real time. At it's heart the fraud detection apparatus is an “attribution” software, meaning it’s used to find the people behind pieces of data. (Sound familiar) That algorithm was then developed into Palantir Gotham for use in the security establishment and  Palantir Metropolis for use in private industry, especially large banks. Both program suites enable users to integrate, analyze, and visualize data from multiple different contexts. </p>
<p>The software is really quite remarkable. l'm sure everyone has seen those giant interwoven conspiracy theory webs of people, organizations, and events, well Palantir is an automated software that churns out multilayered, interactive, and highly detailed versions of those. I would love to get my hands on it but I don't have $500k + to burn.</p>
<p>The software has the capability to track and classify every node of information no matter how small, "down to the level of a single person or nugget of intelligence." If a user isn't authorized to view certain nodes then those nuggets of intel simply remain hidden or fall off the visualization completely. This method also allowed the agencies to follow privacy laws by keeping personal information on American citizens behind a layer of protection. The software even has the added benefit of creating "an audit trail of what the Palantir users were reading, whether they’d handled the information properly, and whether they’d modified it in any way." It sounds like a wet dream for those in charge of the alphabet agencies; no more leaks, no more whistleblowers, and they get to catch all the bad guys, meanwhile the analogical calculus machine par excellence does all the heavy lifting. </p>
<p>People at the CIA were so eager to give the software a spin that "according to a government official familiar with the episode, the CIA allowed Palantir to set up its software in the agency’s counterterrorism center... The official was astounded that a little-known company from Silicon Valley was allowed to place its equipment on a network that pulses with some of the most highly classified intelligence the government collects... an extraordinary departure from normal security protocols." </p>
<p>Apparently finding that whole "reading thing" boring is a more systemic problem than we thought. (Laurence Rockefeller admitted in his biography that reading was too much work) Any good Tolkien fan would of seen the significance that lies behind the name chosen for the company. In the Lord of the Rings, Palintir is "a magical scrying stone that lets it holder see across great distances." The stone is used by Frodo to aid in his quest to destroy the ring of ultimate power, but at the same time it is also used by the evil Sauron to spy on his enemies and "peer into their hearts." Much like it's fictional namesake, the software can be a double edged sword, entirely dependent on whom is holding it, or rather in this case who has sys admin access.</p>
<p>Surely it's no coincidence that Peter Thiel is one of Trump's ardent supporters and given the way in which Hillary Clinton was exposed and defeated I'm willing to bet he played a very large role in that strategy. It's possible that the general public has been distracted looking for individual leakers of information, meanwhile the true culprit was not so much a person, but rather the infrastructure itself. The panic exhibited by the oligarchs was akin to the panic we saw immediately after 9/11 and that surrounding the bailouts. It seemed to ferment immediately after Wikileaks published the Stratfor emails, intensified after the Syria leaks, and culminated with the Podesta leaks. Given the fact that Palantir was the common surface behind all those entities, the elites must of known what was coming and that's why they were so panicked.</p>
<p>However the question becomes, did Frodo just save Middle Earth or did Sauron just ascend to the most powerful office in our country?</p>
<p><strong>Evidence supporting the Frodo scenario</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hitlery was taken out of power and it seems that Darth Soros is next on the short list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In public remarks, several employees have said their job is to assist the people “who are out saving the Shire.”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Palantir is a bottom-up insurgent in the security establishment, it gained influence by persuading and convincing analysts of it's merit, rather than the top brass </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"It recruits employees from among the ranks of its customers. Most of its “embedded analysts,” employees who work on high-priority national-security threats, are former users from the military and intelligence community. A job description on Palantir’s Web site describes the ideal embedded analyst this way: “Although you loathe the bureaucracy, you have a deeply held belief that a revolution in intelligence affairs is not only possible, it is imminent. Help us craft that revolution.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The company has built "a real culture that’s not based on money.” All employees have their salaries capped at $127,000, and are "compensated with bonuses and equity stakes, but most of the engineers could make much bigger salaries if they defected for Facebook or Google. If someone goes to work for Palantir, it’s probably because he or she believes in Palantir and its mission. As naive or unsettling as that mindset may seem, it’s aligned with a credo of public service found more often in the government than in its contractors."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite recommendations by soldiers in the field and a higher success rate uncovering IED attacks, the Pentagon muscled the company out of it's role of providing a more efficient battlefield awareness system. When neither the military or Palantir took that decision lying down the Obama administration sued the company on trumped up discrimination charges.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Sauron Scenario</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thiel is a staunch transhumanist and has avowed that he wants to live forever. This is the same guy that advocated blood plasma transfusions from younger people for life extension benefits (a colossally stupid idea and an efficient means to spread stealth infections)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thiel is a big proponent of artificial intelligence and founded OpenAI with fellow brain trusts Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos among others. Unlike Musk he is not as concerned with the probable negative consequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Employees of Palintir were hacked by Anonymous and caught trying to bring down Wikileaks and Julian Assange. Some of those employees were fired only to be rehired at a later date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one has seen Julian Assange since October 17th, the same day the power was cut to the Ecuadorian embassy and an unplanned drill was enacted at London Heathrow. One would think it would be safe for Julian Assange to show his face now that Trump has won.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Poindexter, the architect of the Iran Contra Scandal, has been involved with and was contracted by Palantir since it's founding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Background on Palantir primarily derived from a 2012 article in The Washingtonian
https://www.washingtonian.com/2012/01/31/killer-app/</p>
<p>Questions </p>
<p>I hazard you're somewhat knowledgeable about the topics surrounding PayPal's rise to prominence given your friendship with Catherine Austin Fitts. The public story is that PayPal was fighting to prevent financial fraud being waged against the clearing system by the Russian Mafia. Was the Russian Mafia, at that time, acting as a cutout for the Black Eagle Trust and those responsible for the crash of the Soviet economy? Did PayPal initially work for against that Bush/Clinton nexus? Which faction from within the establishment was their primary backers and why? Was the secret service heavily involved? Was PayPal a threat or a help for the hidden network of finance and the secret bond market?</p>
<p>What is your sense of Peter Thiel? He is clearly someone that needs to be watched, but who's team do you think he fights for now? How worried should we be about his close relationship with the soon to be Trump Whitehouse? Palantir has already stated that they have set their eyes on entering the healthcare industry. The software could be used to solve a great many problems in medicine and give a better picture into countless diseases, but I also worry it could be used for immense evil if coupled with entrainment technology. </p>
<p>Do you think the technocrats are holding the government hostage? If so is it for their own purposes or are they genuinely trying to do good for the sake of our country? The type of genius people that become high level computer programmers or engineers often fit the mold for "conspiracy theorists".  Maybe I'm grasping at straws but I'm trying to remain hopeful that we've had a positive outcome. </p>
<p>During the live election coverage on Fox, once it was clear that Trump would win, one of the younger commentators excitedly remarked that after bringing down the Clintons, Trump would reopen the 9/11 investigation and go after the Bushes for inside knowledge. Karl Rove did NOT appreciate that statement and immediately tried to head the conversation off. The anchor challenged him and brought up Trump's prior statements on the matter. Rove than got nasty, he said he pulled Trump aside and told him if he were to keep making statements about the Bushes and inside jobs that it would be all too easy to tie him up in endless litigation for libel, and that's when Trump shut up. The other anchors quickly steered the conversation to a new topic. Then when Rove thought the camera was off of him he gave the young anchor a straight up death stare and a look of horror crossed the young anchors face. Do you think it would be wise for Trump to reopen a 9/11 investigation? I can't seem to figure out where the Bush family fits into this puzzle. Did they turn on the Clintons and hang them out to dry? Where are the Bush emails? Are they next on the short list? </p>

        <p><p>My theory is that Trump is also implicated with the Clinton's involvement with Jeffrey Epstein, which is why he never tried to use it against them. Trump has 14 contact addresses in Epstein's Black Book, and has been to Epstein's island at least once.</p>
<p>Trump won't prosecute Clinton. No way in hell. He donated to the Clinton Foundation for access! They Clintons and the Trumps were good friends, for years. They had to act differently in order to give the election the appearance  that it wasn't really a shell game, but they have connections going way back. </p></p>

        <p><p>I think he may be holding back from naming a federal prosecutor as a means of gaining political capital. Pizzagate has the potential to bring people down on both sides of the aisle. In the 60 minutes interview when asked about it his response was my focus is on jobs, the economy, immigration etc. It's his way of saying let me get my policies through or else I blow the lid off of everything. Very very smart imho. Nor is there any reason why he can't pursue investigations privately. It's possible we are looking at Soros and Hillary going down first, as a means to soften the public up, opening them to hearing about pizzagate.</p></p>

        <p><p>As far as i know, Palantir is the software that would be used by well equipped professional investigatiors to investigate organizations and uncover their rings, networks and hierarchies by analyzing, aggregating and visualizing data about communication and money flows and things like that.</p></p>
