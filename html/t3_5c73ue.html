        <p><p>I have a relative who has been a fan of Colbert for years, and I have watched a lot of Colbert in the past as a result. It's what he primarily does for a living, mocking people. He also says outright that he is going to mock the devil. If you look at places like BuzzFeed, liberals have been talking about "pizzagate" for days already and mocking the hell out of it. No reason why Colbert wouldn't also seize on it, again it is what he does for a living. I don't really want to see people with good hearts trying to look into something suspicious be used for some jackass's troll bait comedy, so that's why I'm giving my 2 cents on the matter. </p></p>

        <p><p>I agree, but there are very few in the entertainment industry who would not stoop that low, especially the politically-charged ones. And because it is not a joke, as you put, and is actually a very emotionally charged topic, I know that those of us who are invested in looking into such things might be at higher risk for taking troll bait. Evil comes from many angles. If you're not in denial about pedo rings all over the world, then certainly it wouldn't surprise you if a comedian would mock the topic, too.</p></p>

        <p><p>OK. We get that you think people shouldn't even be looking in this direction because "he was just trying to mock/troll, nothing more or less." You already made your case. Why are you then so intent in trying to downplay any relevance this might have, being borderline defensive about it?</p></p>

        <p><p>It has potential relevance, in that he might be baiting/mocking the people on 4chan and reddit who have been looking into the whole thing, for the reason I already explained. You dodged my question, so I'm just guessing.. Do you think it was some sort of sign that he is also in on some pedo ring? I'm trying to gently inject a little calm and reason, it's easy to fly off the deep end when looking into such scary shit. Massive pedo rings throughout the world and in governments are absolutely real, but if you see a pedo everywhere you see pizza you're gonna start trippin balls. And that's why it makes such excellent troll bait from a comedian who makes a living off of mocking people. Think whatever you want. I'll let you be now.</p></p>
