        <strong>2007 "Mamma Pesto" WaPo about Podesta& Pizza</strong>
        <p><p>Disclaimer: This doesn't give any direct connections to pedophilia. I am searching "around" these links too (thats how i found what i am going to share with you) but i think its important to share everything. This is very basic stuff which doesn't debunk the pedophile story for me but doesn't support it neither. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Podestas Mom had a Italian catering which made dinners for political fundraisers she had many connections and Podesta and brother used to work there too, according to this WaPo article 
Mary Podesta; Staple At Political Dinners</p>

<p>second: I was a small child when that happened and am from Europe BUT is it common that Podesta was a Bill Clinton Buddy AND pizza plays a big role in the Lewinsky scandal(she was ordere to bring him pizza and then blew him)? maybe it is also referencing this? </p></p>
