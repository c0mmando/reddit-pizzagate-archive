        <p><p>Well there are some that believe it to be a means to have investigators chasing their tails. Everything thus far is speculation and all "evidence" seems purely circumstantial, yet a significant amount of manpower is utilized in hopes of finding a smoking gun... to no avail. Now if it were a true psyop, what would they be trying to distract from? That's the question you should be asking.</p></p>
