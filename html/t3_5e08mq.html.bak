        <p><p>Completely horrible fucked up shit you don't want to see. I'm jaded and its rough. Its children, a boy and girl, no older than 7 but acting much older than their age. They discuss that they have decided to stop touching others and themselves [privates], then they say they will also stop killing babies. The boy says they have decided to stop letting people put stuff in their bottoms. Apparently, social services does this to them. That's when I stopped watching.</p>
<p>And I went back in to watch for indications they've been coached to talk. The boy and girl say a lot of stuff in unison, which is a sign of rehearsal. But with that being said, there are breaks where one talks alone and it appears as valid memories. They don't look rehearsed or lying, on their own.</p>
<p>This was posted in the youtube comments, I cant correlate the two incidents. http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ricky-dearman-dad-falsely-accused-5553483</p>
<p>It would completely fall in line with their talking in unison being coaching.</p></p>

Either that's a hell of a coincidence or there really is an international connection with these pedophile group claims.</p>

        <p><p>I know all that stuff is hard to believe (and to listen to), but for some reason, in the video (the UK one) of the girl when she was being interviewed by the police officer she said that the entire school, as in all of the parents (around 400 people iirc) were involved, I found that kind of hard to believe that that amount of people would be involved in that stuff. But on the other hand, some of her responses to the questions were instantaneous, like if she was telling the true, and the same for her brother. I think if she was lying, she would probably stop a little to think of an answer. But after watching this video (the french one), I find it to be way too many coincidences... this shit is crazy as fuck.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not sure we have enough evidence to get celebrities involved yet, but it is worth a shot. It's all in how you present it, it has to be the strongest evidence and should stay as close to the Podesta emails as possible. WL emails are very credible to normies, that's how this has gained any traction at all, remember that.</p></p>

        <p><p>Guys, this OP has only been around 10 days, ive seen this video before and people were telling me its fake. I dont know man, take caution. Shills want to provide false info so they can then cause damage to this all by saying look, pizzagate people are on a massive witch hunt. I try to be very cautious on what i upvote, even the guy with 2gb of cp i didnt upvote cuz u have to be very cautious of someone who blantantly posts tons of cp online.</p></p>

        <p><p>You fucking idiots, this is a prime example of "Satanic Panic", and was covered and debunked in DETAIL in many places. Best coverage is a podcast called Sword and Scale, they grab audio from police interviews etc. </p>
<p>The man you hear talking is their weed- addict step father that forced these children to drink the "green soup" -  a hemp extract soup, which fucks with them.</p>
<p>Please don't take this video at face value, its very easy to do so. They Sword and scale episode explains it all, and why satanic panic is such a dangerous hysteria. iirc the stepfather was jailed</p></p>

        <p><p>No, this was debunked. The psycho mother and her BF had the kids memorize a bunch of bullshit accusations against their father because she's a cunt and wanted custody. They were caught lying and fled the country. </p>
