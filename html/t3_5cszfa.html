        <strong>Gabriella, and Rosa Rosa two other Pizza places, From PA and Italy discovered through Podesta Powerpoint and picture</strong>
        <p><p>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/53523</p>
<p>Translate this to English, somewhat strange subject line, no?</p>
<p>Digging through attachments...</p>
<p>I did a google image search and found that the picture was associated with:
http://www.rosarosapizzeria.com/</p>
<p>The powerpoint had a link to this website at the end of it:
http://www.gabriella.it/</p>
<p>I should add that I am doing feature extraction on any of the jpg pictures I can find and comparing the DCT to that of the stock image (if it exists) to try to discern if there are any major difference in the jpg files.  I am not sure this is useful, but I will let anybody know if anything jumps out.</p></p>
