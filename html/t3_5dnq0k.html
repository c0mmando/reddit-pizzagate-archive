        <p><p>"In their path to the present, the Mahbubanis developed a bond with Haiti, through a family owned manufacturing business that employed 300 people there in the '80s. In this, the poorest country in our hemispehere, the EKTA Foundations has made measurable impact working with stellar partners - the Haitian Education &amp; Leadership Program (HELP), Inveneo and Water.org - to change ground realities for the better. Perhaps more fulfilling is the experience of seeing Haitians at all levels strive to take charge of their destiny, directing their irrepressible spirit to rebuild their country as they find their new place in the world."</p></p>

        <p><p>I guess I should've searched before posting my thread at https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5eam6z/has_anyone_saw_email_5716/</p>

<p>I feel like there may be something new with this. In the e-mail I highlighted, they have a strange picture with the Pope/someone dressed like the Pope. Kind of odd for a simple pizza party.</p></p>
