        <strong>Potential Lead? Strange Powerpoints sent to Podesta?</strong>
        <p><p>Hey everyone, this is my first time using reddit. I've been following all of your research on Pizzagate/Operation Berenstain since the beginning, and it's been truly impressive to say the least. 
I'd like to share a thought with all of you. 
Those who managed to "hack" into the Comet website found a powerpoint presentation of images of bats. Why would that be there?</p>
<p>I then remembered seeing an odd powerpoint slideshow sent to Podesta from this email: johnson_lo@mail2000.com.tw</p>
<p>Here is the email in question: 
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/53544</p>
<p>It's a powerpoint of exotic birds, and seems to me like the sender is from Taiwan.</p>
<p>Why would someone send Podesta this? I mean seriously!</p>
<p>It gets stranger: if you do a Wikileaks search using the email address above, you'll discover that numerous powerpoints have been sent to Podesta, with seemingly completely random subject matter. 
I've seen slides of show dogs, flowers, paintings, buildings.... </p>
<p>If people think steganography is being used, this would be great lead to check out. 
What could be hidden with those images in the various powerpoints?</p>
<p>Thoughts?
Anyone know how to find out if these images are more than what they seem??</p>
<p>EDIT: Here's the one of the flowers...https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/35594</p>

        <p><p><strong>Step 1: I Google translated Podesta Email 35594</strong></p>
<p><em>Peony</em></p>
<p><em>To my dear friends:</em></p>
<p><em>A year has passed! Sadness and joy of joys and sorrows mixed 365 days. . .</em>
<em>Expectations of the new year we can really get back. power. Act happy.</em>
<em>Zen-free persons with folded bow 2009/1/12</em></p>
<p><em>Invite everyone to participate in the party! Invite everyone to participate in the party!</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: I searched Google for "Peony Pedophelia"</strong></p>
<p>Bingo.  Check the results and I think this email might hold the key to other pics. Definite the Peony is coincidentally the name of a park were a huge pedophelia ring was uncovered. Peony means Aphrodisiac.</p>
<p>OK, with this and all the art linked below that is so sick, I think the local NYPD should be contacted. I don't trust the FBI. </p>
<p>Do the hackers know how to decript the Peony image? </p></p>

        <p><p>I don't know! Some pics have been decrypted already, but I don't think anyone has checked these specific powerpoints yet! Spread the word. 
And so many threads relating to this are disappearing on 4chan... Please let me know if you pick up a new thread anywhere!</p></p>

        <p><p>I've been thinking about this a lot today. </p>
<p>What if they aren't used to transmit encrypted data but are instead some type of "receipt," received after a transaction? </p>
<p>I'm going march up against Podesta activity </p></p>

        <p><p>I'd say leave it to the 4chan hackers, there's a lot of different ways to do this stuff. Looks like they've already uncovered a secret service agent sean gallagher is in on it. FBI couldn't do shit about this, seems like the artificial intelligence of the internet is the best way for this thing to become unraveled. </p></p>

        <p><p>I just had a very dark thought. What if they are "serving" some of these kids that go on make a wish trips? There's no concern of them living, and no need for disposal. Any death would be attributed to the terminal illness or condition they suffer from.</p></p>
