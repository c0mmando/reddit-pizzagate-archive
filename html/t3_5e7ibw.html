        <strong>Looking for help from people here to get my story out - I knew all this was happening years ago plus I made many discoveries that I feel could change the world.</strong>
        <p><p>About 8 years ago I began researching something that happened to a family member of mine. I started researching related information and more and more incredible and scary things began to unfold. Eventually it led me to this bizarre occult stuff. I tried to tell everyone on message boards like this but no one would believe me or bother to look deeply into my information. I had to keep elements to myself because I felt my life would be in danger if I revealed too much too soon. I was in an impossible situation. I had the idea to write a fiction story to get people to look into what I had discovered. I wanted to make something entertaining to get people to look more deeply into what I found. The problem is I had to teach myself how to write and reteach myself how to draw to make a graphic novel about the info I wanted to convey. This has been an incredibly long process and my writing is terrible. I put a rough version online to try to get people interested and get feedback on my story.</p>
<p>I am looking for people who have success in writing who could help me or at least give feedback. It would be helpful if people had knowledge of the stuff going on now as well that way I would have to convey less info to them to have them help me with the story.</p>
<p>Also, if people would be interested in helping me financially I have been working on this for 8 years without pay - living with a family member to help me do this. I am at the point now where I may have to stop doing this for financial reasons which would slow my progress getting this out even more. </p>
<p>I could try to convey the info I have discovered here to get support from people.. I might do that if enough people are interested. But there are dangers as I stated above.</p>
<p>If people want to read what I wrote it's here.</p>
<p>The chapters are below - start with "Hidden History"</p>

        <p><p>One of the problems with getting this kind of information out is that the conspiracy community is so divided. I think this is intentional. And I have found that the truth is demonized the most so even in the conspiracy community people won't take the truth seriously. Just like with this pizzagate thing. People who tried to tell others about satanists were not believed by most the conspiracy community.. this is the exact same situation I am in with many of my discoveries. Even the conspiracy community won't help.</p></p>

        <p><p>I would convey what I discovered if we could find someone who I know could be trustworthy and not put me in danger. They could verify my info for others. This person would need knowledge of science.</p></p>

        <p><p>I can give you one small aspect of what I discovered - there is much info that surrounds this as well. But I came to the exact same conclusions as this scientist from a totally different direction. She verified everything I had already discovered on my own.</p>

        <p><p>I believe energy,  and how much we actually know about energy,  is a huge fucking injustice. Is that where you are going with this? Do you believe it is tied in</p></p>

        <p><p>Energy is a huge part of it.. but there is much more. Much of the info is out.. but people haven't quite put the pieces together. Just like rumors of the pedo satanists was true and out there but people didn't believe it.</p>
<p>This is a great video to see as well - but it's just a small introduction to the bigger story.</p>

        <p><p>Well, there are plenty of people who claim that such technology is being suppressed, but this is more of a discussion for /r/conspiracy. I read through the "Hidden History" chapter, and you cover a lot of interesting areas, but I didn't see any connections to pizzagate (maybe it's in the later chapters?). I'd love to hear more about your research and experiences, but I'm afraid this isn't the proper sub for discussing it. PM me or start a post in /r/conspiracy so we can dig into this deeper</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes - the satanic elements come later. But keep in mind that the info I am conveying is the biggest secret of these people.</p>
<p>Also, something I reveal ties into proving why these people take the occult so seriously. It's mind boggling stuff.</p></p>

        <p><p>I've been actively digging for the truth since 2003, and I saw several things that piqued my interest in your story. I look forward to reading through it all later this evening. Thanks for sharing and let me know if there is anything I can do to help</p></p>

        <p><p>the distractions on pizzagate is already bad as it is. plus a fictional story isn't helping anything. even if it was based of rl experience</p></p>

        <p><p>This information is bigger than pizzagate.. MUCH bigger. And it isn't a true fictional story. It's called a roman a clef. It's a story that appears fictional and has fictional elements but reveals secrets.</p>
<p>If I wrote this as fact no one would believe it. Just like if someone told you about pizza gate without the emails to prove it.</p></p>

        <p><p>A "fiction" story that isnt really fiction ... I dont see how it will help. Write that shit as fact, create blog, post it on R/conspriacy oneof the chans. If ts truly a lot of info protect your identity if you do so. If you have facts it doesnt matter that " peoplewont believe me" facts are facts.</p></p>

        <p><p>NOW I could write it more as fact... what is happening now has changed things completely.. remember that before this pizza gate stuff came out people would never believe this. That was why I had to try unconventional methods...</p>
<p>But also realize that this info I have discovered is highly technical.. most people would be lost trying to understand it.. so I had to figure out some way of speaking to the masses... </p></p>

        <p><p>Like I said.. if there was enough interest here I would tell everyone what I know..</p>
<p>But also realize.. if I only tell like a handful of people here.. I could be killed and so could all of you.</p>
<p>There is a reason I have tried to do this the way I have. If I just told you the punchline of everything I discovered it wouldn't make sense.. it takes a lot of time and education to understand it all. Kind of similar to how if people didn't know the child porn code words they would have no idea of what was going on. It took someone with knowledge to see that. This is a 1000 times more complex...</p></p>

        <p><p>It is stupid self interest to use r/pizzagate to solicit people for money and promotion of your book. Get out of here.  </p>
<p>If something really happened to a missing family member, how about giving us legitimate info that will help us with this investigation? Chances are your raw story would gain plenty of traction today, no "book deal" needed.</p></p>

        <p><p>It isn't a missing family member.. I wasn't asking for money.. just conveying my situation.. how people could help.</p>
<p>As I said.. the story I have up is free... The only reason I brought up money is because I could possibly pay someone to help me get this story out. It would just speed up the process. You may not understand that because you don't know how difficult what I am trying to do is.. especially for someone who isn't a writer and who hates writing really. I understand your skepticism and paranoia about scammers.. but try to see this through my perspective. If I cared about money I wouldn't have devoted 8 years of my life to doing this for free... but also keep in mind I had no real career path before doing this. So I tried to make it into a career while getting this info out.. just out of desperation.</p></p>

        <p><p>My father witnessed a true flying saucer at point blank range in the late 60s. He was a senior in high school. He told me about it many years later. About 8 years ago I started researching info related to that... and it was like the proverbial rabbit hole. Info my dad had told me was verified in my research. this led to more and more discoveries. It helped me put the info together that others couldn't.</p>
<p>But what my dad saw was not aliens... or other worldly. There are many many things tied into all this.. it's mind boggling stuff people find impossible to believe...  What we have been told about world history is a total lie.... or at least the most important part was left out and is being hidden and suppressed.</p></p>

        <p><p>Look man.  I believe you.  But as someone who is a published author, writing is freaking HARD WORK.  And it takes a modicum of talent.  At the very least, it is a craft and requires patience and education.</p>
<p>There's no way someone could just sit down with you and explain how to 'write'.  Everyone has a 'voice' and there are many people who are just <em>bad writers</em>.  They can't put into words what they feel.  There are lots of books one could recommend, but I think you are going in the wrong direction here.  It's way more important that you tell the story, and get it online, than it is to try to write the 'great american novel'.  </p>
<p>Your time would have been way better spent learning how to post <em>anonymously</em> than spending 8 freaking years trying to do something that at least, it appears, you realize you're not meant to do.</p>
<p>But if you insist on this path, the best advice anyone could give you is use nouns and verbs and avoid adjectives and adverbs.  Grammar is <em>important</em>, and most people can't even manage a grammatically correct sentence, never mind a freaking book.</p>
<p>Find someone who can help you learn how to post anonymously.  That is the direction you need to take, IMO.  I've also been down this rabbit hole, and while I don't know exactly where you're heading with this story of yours, absolutely nothing would surprise me anymore, since I also <em>know</em> that our history is a freaking lie, a stinking path of lies going all the way back into antiquity.</p>
<p>Evolution, my ass.  These 'evolutionists' can't even explain Rh factor, never mind all the OOP artifacts in the world...</p></p>

        <p><p>Hey, thanks for the info. The thing is I wrote a script. I felt a graphic novel would be better for me to do because I am not a great writer and I don't like the actual process of writing.</p>
<p>The reason I chose to write a story isn't just due to the anonimity issues... it's also because if I tried to tell people what I have put together no one would believe it. From what I have seen this isn't an accident. These people control all the media and news and even the conspiracy community. They have targeted the truth and made it so people in the conspiracy community AND the general public won't take it seriously. This left me little alternative. Even with pizzagate.. people still can't believe it. They still won't believe satanism is for real as well as mind control and other crazy sounding stuff. By using a fiction story my hope was to try to get people to look at these ideas and when they look deeply I feel they will see the truth in it.. </p>
<p>One thing I imagined was that someone who can write could read my story and work with me and possibly rewrite it into something that people would be more interested in. But the tricky part of that would be having to teach them everything I am trying to convey. If they could work on it full time it could go quikcl though.</p></p>

        <p><p>Regarding satanism -- how is the other side, Jesus Christ, holding up against it?</p>
<p>I read the first chapter. Too much jumping around, i.e., too many cuts. Each cut to a different plotline (looks like you have A, B, C running -- which is likely 1 too many) needs to be 4-5X longer. </p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks! Remember this is going to be in comic form so I am hoping it will make more sense that way. What if people read A all at once then B then C?</p>
<p>"needs to be 4-5X longer."</p>
<p>So make each section of the story longer before cutting? Like full scenes rather than shot?</p></p>

        <p><p>About Jesus Christ... I don't know. Maybe this is something we have to go through. If life was easy what is the point? But what scared me is that the elite of the world with all the info I know about have chosen to be evil... That scares me.</p></p>

        <p><p>I spent about 30 minutes reviewing what you have...which, no offense, but is a complete mess.</p>
<p>Writing 101:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>WTF is the synopsis???  You know, a one-two page summary of the plot?  All you have is a nebulous back-cover spiel which could describe about 1000 books already in print.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where is the OUTLINE?  Chapter by chapter summary?  You can't write a book until you know what and where things are going to develop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where are the character descriptions?  Even in a non-fiction book you need to describe the participating characters.  Their personalities.  Their roles.  You have nada.  Nothing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Sorry to be brutally honest, but you should not be pursuing this avenue.  It's obvious from what I have seen, especially since you have spent 8(!!!???) years doing this?  Did you ever read ONE book on the craft of writing?  I don't see how, since you have violated every rule of book writing from the evidence you provide.</p>
<p>Again.  Read my comment.  Find someone or spend the next week (seriously, that's more than it should take) finding out how to post anonymously.  </p></p>

        <p><p>First of all.. I didn't spend 8 years on writing.. just the last couple. I spent 8 years researching this subject matter and learning all the things that I show in the book... And I did read books on writing.. but my story isn't like other stories.. or I didn't know how to do it like other stories. Also, this is a comic.. not a movie.</p>
<p>Have you ever read Watchmen? I tried to do something similar to Watchmen but to go even more extreme with it. Also, keep in mind that I feel it will be easier to understand in comic form.</p></p>
