        <p><p>At this point i feel like this is why society was made. To support this cult presence. And perhaps they just decided it would be easier to do if they could keep more people in a single area. The whole pedo thing has been a part of governments since they have been around. In some cases it was the societal norm (western roman empire). Moloch has been around as long as there has been written word.</p></p>

        <p><p>No, thats bot why society was made. But the peoppe in power are so far out of touch with whats normal. Its possible to have all these secrets if theres an orginization dedicated to it. Just like cancer. </p></p>

        <p><p>Because its the 1% vs the 99% and that one 1% are the gatekeepers to all the media we watch. No "conspiracy" there. Look how consolidated media is.</p></p>

        <p><p>What we have is thin circumstantial evidence that can easily be explained away.</p>
<p>The renders of Madeleine McCann's abductor (and Martin and Mary Smith, who described them, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann#Smith_sighting">only saw one person</a>)? Coincidence. Lots of people look like that. The mole is just noise and it's on the wrong side.</p>
<p>The Instagram photos? A little suspicious, yes, given that Mr. Alefantis has no children, but they don't prove anything. Perhaps he just likes babies but can't have one of his own.</p>
<p>The logos? Innocent mistake, because not everybody bothers to read an FBI report about pedophilia symbols. And stretching the ping pong paddles to look like a butterfly is just sad.</p>
<p>Besta Pizza's logo change in response? They heard the rumours about them, understood that it might be a little creepy to have such a logo, and changed it.</p>
<p>The occult art? Marina Abramovic is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_0">a little weird in general.</a> The Jeffrey Dahmer thing is just coincidence.</p>
<p>Already this subreddit has embarrassed itself enough in searching for evidence. Remember the Italian conversations and z-sec, and now we're jumping all over these trolls who are teasing us? </p></p>
