        <p><p>Let's go through each fact then, for the benefit of people reading. Sticking only to facts, no assumptions or conjectures. Go ahead and tell us which item below you feel is not a fact, and why. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that Podesta's assistant sent an email on his behalf on May 4, 2007. Here is the actual email: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9364</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that emails from John Podesta himself are missing leading up to May 4, 2007: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=&amp;mfrom=&amp;mto=&amp;title=&amp;notitle=&amp;date_from=2006-11-01&amp;date_to=2007-05-04&amp;nofrom=&amp;noto=&amp;count=50&amp;sort=6#searchresult</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that Madeiline McCann went missing on May 3, 2007: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/madeleine-mccann-latest-are-police-any-closer-to-knowing-the-tru/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that the Podestas look very much like the police sketches: https://i.sli.mg/OGaXaM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that the police sketches show a mole above T. Podesta's eyebrow and that T. Podesta indeed has a mole above his eyebrow: https://i.sli.mg/OGaXaM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that Tony Podesta collects imagery from Biljana Djurdjevic: http://archive.is/JgiQk#selection-1205.0-1207.1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that BilJana Djurdjevic's imagery depicts abducted and abused minors: https://i.sli.mg/CO6j0G</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that Tony Podesta has an "arch of hysteria" sculpture in his home: https://archive.fo/vddrO#selection-3905.217-3905.230</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that the sculpture resembles a victim abducted and killed by Jeffrey Dahmer: https://i.sli.mg/jiPRGc </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that people in Tony Podesta's home were horrified when they found photos in his bedroom from K. Grannan who does naked teenagers: https://archive.fo/vddrO#selection-3905.217-3905.230</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that Tony Podesta was found to have stuffed animals near his bed despite being in his 70s and having no children of his own: https://issuu.com/washingtonlife/docs/wl0615_inside_homes/3 and close up: https://i.sli.mg/RZ8nxV</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that Tony Podesta has been friends with Dennis Hastert for many years and still keeps in touch with him: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48488</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that Dennis Hastert molested multiple children: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/09/us/dennis-hastert-molested-at-least-four-boys-prosecutors-say.html</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, all of the above is factual -- 100% :) -- and links have been provided for you to verify it as such. So if you want to say none of it's true, then the onus is on you to tell readers why you think the information contained in said links is forged or otherwise wrong. Downvoting or counter-asserting without argument is not a valid answer. You will have to address the actual details. </p>
<p>Now that we have the cumulative set of facts before us, it is justifiable for people to ask what the explains this set of facts. Whether the facts are best explained as a matter of total coincidence or whether they are best explained as a matter of the Podesta's being involved in child abduction is a determination that readers can make on their own. All we have done is provide verifiable data. </p></p>

        <p><p>The only disputable fact here is that the one about the mole on Tony Podesta's sketch. It is disputable because those sketches can't be of two brothers because they are renderings of two people's accounts of one person. </p>
<p>But that's not the point. The point is we have no reason to connect any single one of these points to any of the others. </p></p>

        <p><p>Podesta was gaining info on Portugese politics via subscription. https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/41384</p>
<p>The Podestas confirmed traveling there. https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/23724</p>
<p>Podesta is tied to Murdoch and Freud (villa in Portugal) https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/hacked-emails-reveal-plan-to-counter-rupert-murdochs-climate-denial</p>
<p>The Podesta Group does consulting work for Tyco which has three facility and office locations in Portugal. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podesta_Group</p>
<p>Podestas were associates with the Ambassador to Portugal, E. Bagley. https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/24177</p>
<p>Too much to fit inside a summary meme. But it is telling that you chose to focus on terminology and dodged all of the substantive material. You are honestly going to maintain that the Podestas have never stepped foot in Portugal? LOL</p></p>

        <p><p>This sub and your post history are one of the most disturbing and pathetic things I've ever seen on the internet. </p>
<p>It's a combination of cringe and legitimate revulsion at your activity. </p>
<p>I've seen some fucked up things on the internet in my day, but this entire charade of a subreddit makes my skin crawl the most. </p>
<p>You know you're lying. You know you're grasping at straws. Is it mental illness? Is it an easy out so that you don't have to engage in meaningful political discourse? Is it trolling? I just don't understand. It's  simultaneously maddening and frightening.   </p></p>

        <p><p>Like I said, it's fairly obvious you're either a troll, are attempting very amateurish disinformation or suffer from mental illness paired with delusions of grandeur and paranoid delusions. </p>
<p>I'm not sure which one it is, but it's a fool's errand to argue with either possibility. </p>
<p>If anyone reading this does suffer from mental illness, this isn't meant to be an insult. </p>
<p>I hope this person seeks help if he's legitimate. </p></p>

        <p><p>The fact so many people I see here are so quick to <em>personally</em> insult the people who created this "pointless and ridiculous theory" makes me think they are angry that something they love is being <strong>revealed</strong> to the public and that they are hastily trying to protect their pride.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah they could be as you said.</p>
<p>But no, they don't take the time to argue seriously, <em>without</em> joking or memeing or personally insulting the person who posted "evidence". &lt;If they do this as an argument to <strong>anything</strong> they lose all credibility.</p>
<p>I'm not taking a side here. Just saying.</p></p>

        <p><p>B-b-but muh free speech! You claim to have proof of someone being a pedophile... but instead it's just accusation upon accusation. Where I'm from this is called defamation and will maybe get you in jail. So please, while you people destroy other people's lives since you want to find a way to get your frustration out of your system or whatever, stop making me sound like the prick. Because frankly, I am not.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes attack the person because that somehow makes facts less true. I don't even sub here and it's still easy to und r stand his argument, while every part of your argument is "I'm gonna make fun of you for your post history and call you a liar". You sound like you were bred from CTR.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, well then I hope the irony is not lost on you, when you tell me that doesnt make facts less true. He did not bring any facts, all he did was asking Filmpolice if he was mentally ill, without giving any arguments.</p>
<p>So I gave him a bit of his own medicine. I did not call him a liar, I told him that someone with a journalism degree should probably change his attitude and work with facts instead of insults.</p></p>

        <p><p>WHAT ABOUT ALL THE ART WORK OF THE CHILDREN </p>
<p>Ive never, ever, seen any art like that.</p>
<p>For Podesta to get all that pedo art, it wasn 'an accident' but clearly thats his fetish and he search specifically for all of it. </p>
<p>So my argument is based on this artwork alone, this warrants a full FBI investigation, IMO.  If he is innocent, the FBI will tell us.</p></p>

        <p><p>There are incorrect statements in your post.  Particular about the UK Police knowing who abducted Madeleine McCann but international law getting in the way.    </p>
<p>The Police named the person as Jose Carlos de Silva, who worked for the resort and has zero links to Podesta.  The reason for the interference is because he and his accomplices (a gang of thieves) had already been questioned and British Police have no fresh evidence that they would need to be able to question them again.</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree with you. This whole thing is just absurd. I hate Hillary and Podesta and I wouldn't be surprised one bit if he was involved in shit like this, but I won't believe it until there is actual proof. This is purely circumstantial and just conjecture from one person with a kickstarter link at the end. I mean come on.... </p>
<p>This is so ridiculous. This is the problem right here. People believe shit without a shred of concrete evidence. I don't know how anyone can defend this mob mentality. As you stated above this is just grasping at straws. Why make this post? Why spread bullshit? This isn't "awareness," he is just an asshole willing to destroy someone without proof.</p>
<p>I was with Wikileaks every step of the way this election. I think Podesta is a scumbag, but our system is supposed to be based on using concrete evidence for proof of guilt. Not a single bit of this is proof. They are just looking for attention for their bullshit crusade. </p>
<p>You ever read about the Salem Witch trials? It is people like this who propagate that mindless bullshit. They are willing to spread baseless conjecture without proof to destroy someone THEY think did something, when there is no real evidence. </p></p>

        <p><p>Because you still have to fill out too many blank dots to actually call this evidence of anything other than the podesta brothers being in portugal at a certain time. It doens't actually <em>prove</em> anything.  </p>

        <p><p>Yea but that's one piece. The Instagram posts,the strange art work, the convicted pedophiles for friends, the cheese pizza emails that are obviously not about normal pizza. I'm not saying I'm certain he is responsible for the abduction of Madeleine. But what we know for a fact is very strange and he and his brother should be investigated not defended.</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>

<p>Probably not, but there is a HUGE leap from "not normal pizza" to "elite circle of pedophile satanists"  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>and he and his brother should be investigated not defended.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly they should be investigated instead of being flung around the internet wrapped in a bunch of conjecture, but i don't see why the whole thing about assuming peoples innocence until they actually have been convicted of a crime isn't the case with these guys.</p></p>

        <p><p>Not only that, these pizza places have pedophile symbolism everywhere. I'm not saying convict them now. But would that kind of art work appeal to you? It's all very strange and I find it mind blowing that people are writing this off as crazy or trying to discourage people from looking for more information. It makes me more suspicious.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well i'm not well versed in pedophile symbolism, so i can't really tell which of it is fake or not. But have you ever thought about how someone could be making up "facts" about pedophile symbolism to fit with the story?</p></p>

        <p><p>I thought the symbols for comparison were from the FBI website. And I think an open source investigation is a good thing. What I've seen doesn't look like tin foil hat flat earth conspiracy like mainstream media make it out to be. I just want people to keep the discussion going and if it leads to the FBI seeking emails prior to Madeleine being abducted and leads to something then great. If not then it's only a corner of reddit looking through actual leaked information. I'm not spending my time going through emails but I'm glad there are people more enthused than I am that will.</p></p>

<p>And that  truly is a noble cause, cheers to you people. In no way was i trying to discourage anyone from informing themselves and others. On the contrary, but just don't forget that even suspected pedophiles have legal rights.  </p>
<p>When people make up their minds about whether or not someone is a pedophile on the basis of a meme, you could get worried that its turning into a witchhunt.   </p>
<p>All the accusations of satanism doesn't really help anyone. The only one thats a confirmed occultist (not satanist though) is Marina Abramovic, but noone is accusing her of being a pedophile, or how?  </p>
<p>I personaly think pizzagate was set in motion by the democrats. It's their punishment for Podesta not winning the election for Hillary. It will set a hell of an example for coming campaign leaders. "Loose, and we'll sell you to the social media as a satanist pedophile" theres just no coming back from accusations like that whether they are true or not.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think the chances of the Democrats going after one of their own is about as probable as the satanism story flowing from Alex Jones with tears in his eyes. I tell people to look at the subreddit to see what they make of these emails discussing 6,9,11 children in the pool for our entertainment.. that seems real fucking weird. I hope if there is anything to it people keep an open mind to it and see where it goes. Shouldn't matter if your a Democrat or a Republican. The election is over, propaganda from the russians or wiki leaks shouldn't fly. BTW I was told at work today that 20 wiki leaks emails have been proven to be fake regarding hillary confirming isis is backed by the Saudi governmen.. Anyone heard that confirmed?</p></p>

        <p><p>All this 'evidence' proves is that they have been to Portugal before... it is worthless. That weird stuff about child abuse photos is pure conjecture. Teddy's by the bed without having kids is completely normal, my girlfriend has a bunch and we don't have kids. That link there about being tied to Murdoch says nothing of the sort, it actually implies the opposite.</p>
<p>I just don't understand how you can come to any sort of conclusion here. I didn't even know who Podesta is before this post, but 5 minutes of googling shows you to be completely wrong.</p></p>

        <p><p>They certainly hope you only do 5 minutes of googling, also why dont you rationalize their strange coded emails, also im sure "handkerchief with a pizza related map" is a real item and totally not codeword for something insidious. I could go on, but really all this guy would need to do for most of these people to leave him alone is explain this handkerchief. </p>
<p>Just remember they want to have enough plausible deniability surrounding them that most people will only look into it for 5 minutes tops before they shy away and blue pill.</p></p>

        <p><p>Almost all of this is circumstantial evidence. Things were "spotted" without context, the entire argument for Podesta's abducting McCann is based on thinly linked conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>I don't like Podesta or Hilary, but you take things to this degree of absurdity and you weaken/cheapen all legitimate arguments.</p></p>

<p>It is a fact that Tony Podesta has been friends with convicted pedophile Dennis Hastert for many years and they stay in touch: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48488 and 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hastert#Guilty_plea</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that Tony Podesta, in his 70s, has stuffed animals near his bed despite not having children of his own: https://issuu.com/washingtonlife/docs/wl0615_inside_homes/3 and here is a close-up https://i.sli.mg/RZ8nxV</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, if you are going to say none of these things are true, despite all being publicly verifiable, then the onus is on you to explain what specific information in the links above is false, and why. Downvoting everything or counter-asserting without argument that "it's not true" is a non-answer.</p>
<p>It is justified for people to ask for an explanation of the cumulative set of facts above. Whether the explanation is that it is all a matter of total coincidence or whether the explanation is that the Podestas are involved in child abduction is a determination that readers are able to make on their own. </p></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that the Podestas look very much like the police sketches: https://i.sli.mg/OGaXaM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that the police sketches show a mole above T. Podesta's eyebrow and that T. Podesta indeed has a mole above his eyebrow: https://i.sli.mg/OGaXaM</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, all of the above is factual -- 100% :) -- and links have been provided for you to verify it as such. So if you want to say none of it's true, then the onus is on you to tell readers why you think the information contained in said links is forged or otherwise wrong. Downvoting or counter-asserting without argument is not a valid answer. You will have to address the actual details. </p>
<p>Now that we have the cumulative set of facts before us, it is justifiable for people to ask what the explains this set of facts. Whether the facts are best explained as a matter of total coincidence or whether they are best explained as a matter of the Podesta's being involved in child abduction is a determination that readers can make on their own. All we have done is provide verifiable data. </p></p>

        <p><p>Portugal is 35k sq mi, though. That's like saying "a child went missing in South Carolina and a person went to South Carolina." There's no evidence that they were ever even near each other. Everything else is <em>incredibly</em> circumstantial.</p></p>

        <p><p>This headline represents everything that was wrong with the past election cycle and "fake news" in general. Some of the elements in your meme may be true, but other parts are conjecture and assumptions at best, falsehoods purposely presented as facts at worst. What you've presented is a jumbled list of things that leads a reader to the narrative of your choosing. </p>
<p>If you want to present evidence for review and create meaningful dialogue, these fantastical headlines and all caps "screams" do you a disservice. You're immediately discrediting your argument.</p></p>

        <p><p>Look, a lot of this info is really good, I'll give you that. This is first post I've looked at on this sub, and I'm getting convinced. </p>
<p>But you can't go around claiming that suspicions are fact. Claiming something to be 100% factual and true when it's mostly conjecture <em>inspired</em> by facts feels like click bait, and instantly discredits you. </p>
<p>You're doing good work, just present with a little less panic, and take a more level headed approach next time. People like reason, not propaganda. </p>
<p>Keep going though dude. People are turned off on this post, but there IS substance here. </p></p>

<p>So when people upvote pizzagate related stuff we can assume that they don't want that info out either or how does that work?</p></p>

        <p><p>Wikipedia is a wonderful starting platform. It's great for getting general overview and figuring out in what directions to start working, but it is probably the least reliable source you can use. Biased sources are easy to spot, but don't assume because it's presented as an encyclopedia entry that the writer wasn't biased or had any knowledge about the subject.<br>
Start trying to get real sources and verification <br>
First place, Wikipedia will tell you the sketches are two descriptions of one person.<br>
Second, you should recognize that any source referencing Wikipedia has not put in the effort. Additionally, it weakens your credibility by citing that source.</p></p>

        <p><p>This isnt a science or math article its ramblings and conspiracy theories. Without evidence and i mean HARD evidence not bullshit like "hey i heard they traveled to that country" bullshit no one outside of conspiracy circles will bite. Real hard work needs to be done to find proof and that wont be done on Wikipedia.</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>Some have responded that the sketches are only representations of one person. This is false. Initially reports indicated just one suspect, but it has grown to as many as six. As confirmed by the BBC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The number of suspects changing does not change the fact that the sketches were of the same person. You have not yet provided a single shred of evidence to suggest that the sketches were of two different men. And quite frankly, I think you created that stupid site since you parrot it verbatim.</p></p>

        <p><p>You're correct. Go to the wiki page referenced, the section titled Thursday or something. Smith Sighting. The photos are reconstructions from a husband and wife of one individual.<br>
If nothing else, this is a good reminder that witness reconstructions of faces are really poor... try to describe how the last person you saw waiting to cross the street. That's what many people trying to help attempt to do.</p></p>

        <p><p>Okay but you're assuming that the husband and wife weren't involved. Maybe they chose to describe the conflicting appearances of the brothers that they let rape their daughter, to try to throw off the search; only, years later, to lead us right to the actual culprits. </p></p>

        <p><p>Brilliant. They were in on it, but instead of:
A) describing any random other person 
B) making up a person 
C) saying the person wore a mask 
D) saying they didn't see anyone</p>
<p>They <em>instead</em> describe the actual two culprits, but try to hide it by saying it's actually one person. Amazing deduction. </p></p>

        <p><p>Thought we were told not to take Wikipedia as a serious source? But everyone's quoting it in this "its a single person character description". I struggle to see how a husband and wife could differ so greatly in description of a single man. I mean ones clearly fat and the other skinny. </p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mary and Martin Smith, from Ireland, told police they saw a man carrying a child matching Madeleineâ€™s description at around 10pm on Rua da Escola Primaria, 500 yards from the McCannsâ€™ apartment. He was heading towards the beach, did not look like a tourist and did not seem comfortable carrying the child, they said.</p>
<p>Their evidence was compelling, but it was only in October 2013 that two e-fit images of the man, compiled by police from descriptions given by Mr and Mrs Smith, were released by Scotland Yard to coincide with a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction of Madeleineâ€™s disappearance. He remains a suspect.</p>

        <p><p>Although conjecture, the safest way to not get snitched on, would be to do the crime yourself.</p>
<p>Imagine trying to pay someone to kidnap a kid - impossible, its the worst crime in the world. Most criminals would turn you in.</p></p>

<p>Mary and Martin Smith, from Ireland, told police they saw a man carrying a child matching Madeleineâ€™s description at around 10pm on Rua da Escola Primaria, 500 yards from the McCannsâ€™ apartment. He was heading towards the beach, did not look like a tourist and did not seem comfortable carrying the child, they said.</p>
<p>Their evidence was compelling, but it was only in October 2013 that two e-fit images of the man, compiled by police from descriptions given by Mr and Mrs Smith, were released by Scotland Yard to coincide with a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction of Madeleineâ€™s disappearance. He remains a suspect.</p>

        <p><p>To be fair, it does not specify where he was. It simply notes that he was not tending to his emails. </p>
<p>Taken in isolation the fact is unremarkable, but as part of a cumulative case with the other relevant facts it starts to take on significance. </p></p>

        <p><p>I hate to burst your bubble, but in most of these conclusions, you're reaching.  It looks like you're approaching this with an answer in mind and trying desperately to make the pieces fit the answer you want to believe is true.  That's really bad investigation and does more harm to the answer you want than good.</p></p>

        <p><p>No no no no. You are establishing a gigantic link chain to a largely unfounded belief. If the links of the chain are incredibly weak (even just one) the whole thing falls apart. The problem is that you are finding incredibly weak evidence but believe that he is already the criminal so you are exclusively interpreting the evidence to try and corroborate your claim</p></p>

        <p><p>Alt-right is a non-existent thing. Just like with anonymous you can lump whoever you want into that drawer. Before Clinton's speech that basically reinvented the term, you couldn't hear anything about the so called "alt-right" on T_D or 4chan... Clinton invented it as a brand to discredit Trump's supporters (not that they need much help with that). Journalists write as if 4chan was a part of the alt-right movement... they don't realize 4chan (pol and b) is made of different people fucking around, larpers, tards, neets, trolls, conspiracy enthusiasts, fake neonazis, real neonazis, proxy players, all on one board. You can't apply logical thinking on it.</p>
<p>This pizza thing is based on a few real suspicious circumstances about Podesta, however various conspiratards from the whole political spectrum saw an opportunity and latched onto it and laced it with layers upon layers of made up bullshit (see OP).</p></p>

        <p><p>/r/altright - a community for 6 years</p>
<p>Check their storm fronty discord channel if you're short on memes about Jews. </p>
<p>/r/thenewright is considerably less racist but equally shit with their sources and are parroting completely discredited stories like 3 million illegal immigrants voting Clinton (source: a single tweet) . It's a very real movement. Clinton latched onto making fun of alt right but she did it fairly late in the cycle, that shit has been running for a while, both on reddit and the similar sentiments on /Pol/. </p></p>

<p>The credibility of <em>pizzagate</em>?  No, there was no credibility from the get go.  But throwing in the McCann thing pushes the whole absurd, preposterous thing into the "not really even trying to keep the joke plausible" realm.</p></p>

        <p><p>Other than the drawings, the only things we have <em>verified</em> as of yet is the wiped emails, and a possible connection through accused pedophile Sir Clement Freud who owns the villa 1/3 a mile away where the McCanns stayed to "escape the media."</p>
<p>Edit: And the drawings of the suspect(s) look like them.</p></p>

        <p><p>Don't forget the friendship with pedophile Dennis Hastert, the obsession with imagery depicting child abduction and abuse, the odd stuffed animals near the bed. </p>
<p>There are other oddities, like the fact that they have a large underground facility beneath their home -- which they say is for "art" -- but those were left out because they are more speculative in nature. </p>
<p>Based on the known facts alone, there is strong inductive and abductive evidence for people to be rational in concluding the Podestas were involved. </p></p>

        <p><p>No, I'm saying because there's no evidence a child was molested or harmed at the restaurant.  There's also no accounts of children missing in DC.  That's where the comparison to the accounts of satanic ritual abuse in the 1980s seem fully on point.  Here's a good book by Carl Sagan about it.

        <p><p>I just checked wikipedia, and he's right that it's supposed to be a single suspect:</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann#Smith_sighting</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The man was mid-30s, 5 ft 7 in â€“ 5 ft 9 in (1.75â€“1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He did not look like a tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child.</p>

        <p><p>Here's an article from the Guardian about the two sketches of the single man (via Wikipedia): https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/14/british-detectives-efits-madeleine-mccann-suspect</p>
<p>Also the "source" OP linked says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Some have responded that the sketches are only representations of one person. This is false. Initially reports indicated just one suspect, but it has grown to as many as six. As confirmed by the <a href="http://livingresistance.com/2016/11/18/podestas-involved-mccanns-abduction-factual-analysis/">BBC</a>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is false. If the author had bothered to actually read the article he himself linked he would see that the article says that they are different sketches of the same, single person.</p>
<p>Photo caption says for the two images:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sighted at 22:00 carrying girl</p>
<p>Different image of man sighted at 22:00</p>
</blockquote></p>

        <p><p>I don't know shit about this case, only what I've read because of this post, but if the narrative you're advancing is that it's two suspects, then you're going to need to provide additional evidence. </p></p>

        <p><p>As /u/gregmasta has pointed out in the comment just above mine. The article that this person is trying to use as hard evidence states that this claim of it being one person is false. He links the article used for this source in Wikipedia. Therefore the proof refuting this claim that it's two different people  has been proven inaccurate.</p>
<p>If you can provide me information from a source that isnt biased where it states it's one person then we can have a discussion. </p>
<p>Edit: <a href="http://www.gerrymccannsblogs.co.uk/press/78oct13/Times_27_10_2013.htm">link to article</a> so you can read it for yourself instead of taking Wikipedia at face value. </p></p>

        <p><p>I just read that article.  They don't state anywhere that anyone saw two suspects.  There were two different sightings at two different times of men carrying children.  One was ruled out, as it was determined to be someone else carrying his child to a room.  The second sighting, the Smith sighting, is still unexplained and deemed credible.</p>
<p>Heres another article, where they describe those two pictures as two different e-fits of the same person, but from two different witnesses, mr and mrs smith:</p>
<p>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/madeleine-mccann-latest-are-police-any-closer-to-knowing-the-tru/</p>
<p>Maybe you can point to where anyone has suggested there could be two suspects, because it doesn't seem credible.</p></p>

        <p><p>You linked the fathers blog. When the man that made the photo fit you all have faith in saw Gerry McCann he was sure it was him. Plus the cadaver dogs reaction at three different points, plus the dna evidence all point to the parents. Two different detective companies hired by the parents came to the conclusion it was them.</p></p>

        <p><p>It doesn't say what the last edit was or when that section was edited (regardless the post above me proved that they cited the source incorrectly if you actually read it, so there's that) my point was that a Wikipedia page doesn't prove or disprove a damn thing. That was the only form of evidence offered  (which again was incorrect information)</p></p>

        <p><p>It does not. You are misreading the semi-confusing caption, and purposefully so obviously to mislead others. </p>
<p>For anyone truly confused there are 6 pictures in two rows of three. The caption gives two lists, one for each row, in which each picture is identified with descriptions separated by a semicolon. The two sketches in question are the first in each row as are their associated descriptions which indicates they are different sketches of one person identified only by the time they were seen and where.</p></p>

These two refreshed images released years later are clearly pointing the finger at the two responsible - because they are/were untouchable. </p></p>

        <p><p>This got delved into deeply on chans.  I don't keep the screens.  Ask them and they will tell you everything on 8pol.</p>
<p>The one person story exists.  There is a definite account of 2 ppl describing the same person.  The Tony-lookalike cannot be described as thin.</p>
<p>It was a separate person from the guy carrying the kid.  That guy was found and cleared.  The matching pajamas included.</p>
<p>Later reports indicated multiple suspects, more connected to a local group of thieves, and reports of problems due to multiple countries jurisdictions.  The Portuguese claimed they couldn't go after their suspects.</p>
<p>It was easily enough confusion and story changing from both the Portuguese and British authorities to make the conclusion that the pictures were not necessarily of the same people.  Up to 4 sketches exist.  At one point, the UK authorities thought the parents were complicit but they claimed it was retaliation for their persistence.</p>
<p>We are rehashing here.  And I'm done.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm gonna wager a guess he doesn't have sources for almost any of this.</p>
<p>The entire post is subjective interpretation of facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The possession of stuffed animals does not make somebody a pedophile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Mingling with students" when you're a teenager doesn't make you a pedophile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that the Podesta brothers haven't officially responded to these allegations does not prove or disprove their involvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that Wikileaks doesn't have any Podesta emails older than May 2007 does not mean those emails were wiped.</p>
</li>
</ul></p>

        <p><p>Folks attending a house tour in the Lake Barcroft neighborhood in Falls Church earlier this year got an eyeful when they walked into a bedroom at the Podesta residence hung with multiple color pictures by Katy Grannan, a photographer known for documentary-style pictures of naked teenagers in their parents' suburban homes.</p>
<p>"They were horrified," Heather recalls, a grin spreading across her face.</p>

        <p><p>See the issue is when this is presented as fact, and then the actual article just says 'he has photographs from Katy Grannan in his house and bedroom' vs "Guests were horrified when they saw photos of undressed teens in his bedroom."</p>
<p>Nearly everything related to this dumb conspiracy is like this.  A small thing taken out of context, then twisted as misleading as possible, and then the defense is that there is this 'mountain' of evidence.</p>
<p>Like he has teddy bears on his bed?  The fact that is even brought up is retarded, but then its like 'oh but think of all the other evidence then it doesn't seem silly'.</p>
<p>Or that when the bar wanted to stay open till 2 am, it was linked that the zoning official or whatever said he thought the bar had connection to 'rape and murder', then you look at the article, and the official says that he thinks having bars open till 2 am contributes to the rapes and murders in other parts of town, which is a completely different thing to say than something specific about the pizza place.</p>
<p>I'm all for a good scandal but this is just the weakest conspiracy i've ever seen.</p></p>

        <p><p>The actual article says, quoting Heather podesta "They [i.e. 'the guests'] were horrified." It's a fact that Heather Podesta is quoted as saying that the art of naked teenagers prominently displayed horrified her guests. I simply posted a source where one was requested.</p></p>

        <p><p>It is not a fact, unless you can provide a different source.  All I see is these statements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They have artwork from Katy Grannan in their bedroom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Katy Grannan has at some point taken photos of teenagers with shirts off etc.  -- keeping in mind she has a LOT of work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'Guests were horrified' -- in the context of being horrified by the artwork displayed in the house.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So lets review the original statement, proposed as 100% fact:  "Guests were horrified when they saw photos of undressed teens in his bedroom."  -- specifically, where does it say guests were horrified <em>when they saw photos of undressed teens in his bedroom</em></p></p>

        <p><p>The last image about the news headline of McCann's alleged kidnappers being known by police but not being able to be named is also <a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2014/01/06/reports-police-know-who-kidnapped-madeleine-mccann-can%E2%80%99t-arrest-them">from 2014</a>. The image states it's a recent police finding however <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2016/04/28/british-cops-know-who-snatched-maddie-5848349/">this 2016 article</a> sourcing The Sun has updated details where the suspects are all named.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>British police now believe that one of the gang members, Jose Carlos de Silva, who worked for the resort where the McCannâ€™s family were staying, was involved, reports The Sun.</p>
<p>De Silva, 30, who transported tourists around the Mark Warner resort, is believed to have been working with a 16-year-old youth and two other men.</p>
<p>The two men were identified as Ricardo Rodrigues, 24, and Paulo Ribeiro, 53.</p>
<p>The teen later told police he became involved in the gang because he was desperate for money to buy a sports car.</p>

        <p><p>Sorry, I should have been more clear.  They aren't drawings per-se, they're composite images generated by a computer program called "E-Fit".</p>
<p>If you look closely, the eyes/eyebrows, nose, and mouth are almost exactly the same.  The only big differences are the skin tone, jaw structure, and hair.  It makes sense that these features would be more variable, since the witness saw this person in the dark.</p>

<p>I'm just going to keep posting this until you get your head out of your ass and provide any citation or evidence that the drawings are of two different people. To date, you have not, despite my requesting that publicly of you multiple times. In my estimation, it's because you're a shill trying to distract and mislead us with your bullshit.</p></p>

        <p><p>Claiming this meme is 100% fact means the whole thing is compromised, because the police sketches cited in Point #5 were two pictures of the same man. I've posted this about a dozen times. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/madeleine-mccann-latest-are-police-any-closer-to-knowing-the-tru/</p>

<p>So far, no one on this subreddit has managed to supply any link to dispute this fact. I know the sketches are uncanny, but both Podestas cannot be a single suspect.</p></p>

        <p><p>Also, the claim that the (presumed- but even if true, it makes no sense) fact Podesta deleted his emails <em>before</em>McCann went missing- Somehow he knew ahead of time the McCanns would (a) eat out (b) leave Maddie in the hotel, and (c) not hire a sitter?</p>
<p>All indications are the McCann case was either the parents, or a crime of opportunity- planning days ahead doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>The whole 'undisputed' (lol) list/meme/theory is 100% conjecture, (again, even assuming the specific claims are true- even though it's almost all unsourced info).</p></p>

        <p><p>Interestingly, the paintings you speak of were of nude adults. He had numerous large books that contained photos of paintings from all over the world. The pictures of nude children that you speak of is a book called "A Boy: A Photographic Essay" from 1964. You can buy it on Amazon. His copy was found to have an inscription to him from a fan. A gift sealed the deal for his charges. Podesta is actively seeking it out but that is totally fine. It's fucked up. </p></p>

        <p><p>The picture of the girl is not who you say she is, that girl is called Peggy who was kidnapped in Germany over a decade ago. So much for 100% fact? Not saying your shit is wrong but if you can't even verify the source of pictures then your "100% fact" PDF loses all credibility.</p></p>

        <p><p>Listen, I think this is a very jumbled and sloppy conspiracy theory as well, but you're wrong. I checked. Here is an article likening the disappearance of Peggy to that of Madeleine McCann, but the image used is that of Madeleine.</p>
<p>https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1393769/girl-who-went-missing-from-school-15-years-ago-is-discovered-in-forest-just-nine-miles-from-her-home/</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, just reverse image search the picture.</p>
<p>All that being said: Are we really going off that, because a sculpture that Podesta openly displays in his home looks like one position that Jeffrey Dahmer put his victim him and took a picture, it's any sort of 'proof' that Podesta kidnapped a little girl in Portugal (where he's "known to travel", like millions of others)? There is nothing concrete here... It's just random observations put together to create a fantastic claim.</p></p>

        <p><p>There is a lot more to it than just this stupid infographic. https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5b1qtf/comet_ping_pong_pizzagate_summary/</p>
<p>I will fully admit It's all coincidences, but there are a LOT of them.</p>
<p>As for the satanist thing - <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15893">tony podesta</a> attended <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EsJLNGVJ7E">this</a> style of event, and it was inferred that <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/25325">John Podesta</a> has done so in the past.</p>
<p>Satanist? maybe not, but it does have a ton of occult properties. Oh, its also crazy as fuck.</p>
<p>I'm not usually a conspiracy person, and despite some of the fake stuff people post here - there is a pretty good case showing that something is going on here. A few coincidences are expected, but this many is absurd.</p></p>

<p>Agreed. and whenever you start looking to confirm a narrative, its often easy to make connections which, in reality, don't exist.</p>
<p>If somebody could comb through every email I ever sent and look closely at every association with people I've ever had. Who knows what plausible conspiracy they could come up with. And this is how every conspiracy theory works. The sky is the limit.</p></p>

        <p><p>Reddit has become a place where fact/reality/truth literally mean the exact opposite of what they used to mean. It's all about feelings and stupid conspiracy theories. I hope this place goes under, like digg did, and then we all migrate to the new Reddit while the alt-intellectuals crawl back into some other shithole </p></p>

        <p><p>All these stupid wikileaks are lies by the russians! /s</p>
<p>Wikileaks, Edward Snowden, has uncovered a lot of things that would have been dismissed as conspiracy nut posts. That's why it's actually possible there are pedo rings within the most powerful and wealthy. (note: there always has been)</p>
<p>I think most people actually investigating this can clearly see where OP's logic is flawed. </p></p>

        <p><p>That's not a real argument, that's name calling. You obviously haven't read anything about this subject and you have no idea what you're talking about so why don't you gtfo and go read up on it before coming on here and calling people mentally ill?</p></p>

        <p><p>It's not just name calling (though I'll admit it's partially that), it's also pointing out the silliness of his particular argument. Why should somebody have to deny each and everything that anybody says? If a public figure acknowledges every wild claim made against them, the number of wild claims is going to increase to an annoying point (and acknowledging a ridiculous claim can be perceived by the public as give it legitimacy, or give news stations reason to cover it, even if the best evidence is that his email conversations are quirky). </p>
<p>Also, isn't it kind of un-American to say that somebody exercising their 5^th amendment right is wrong for doing so? </p>
<p>Edit - also, who made you the pc police, getting triggered on the behalf of somebody I called mentally ill?</p></p>

        <p><p>Everything about this, from the overly sensationalist title, to the complete lack of credible sources. And wild jumps in conclusions and logic. And How have we come to the point where we can't have any form of disagreement without being a paid shill. Nobody has ever paid me $1 to browse the internet,  but it sure would be nice.

        <p><p>I am not "trying to discredit an investigation into pedos?" because you are not investigators, you are redditors, and i dont need to discredit anything because you have no proof of them being pedos in the first place. </p>
<p>You could make anyone seem like anything you want by using flawed logic and baseless accusations. </p></p>

        <p><p>That is an important point to make. Each fact considered in isolation is rather insignificant. A lot of people delete emails, a lot of people have stuffed animals, and it would be inane to accuse them of anything. </p>
<p>But when each fact adds up to a cumulative case, then an explanation is needed. </p>
<p>In other words, when an old childless man has stuffed animals by his bed AND he is friends with a pedophile AND he matches police sketches in a child abduction case AND he collects imagery of abducted children (etc.) then it is more difficult to suppose that it is all a sheer coincidence. </p></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that emails from John Podesta himself are missing leading up to May 4, 2007: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=&amp;mfrom=&amp;mto=&amp;title=&amp;notitle=&amp;date_from=2006-11-01&amp;date_to=2007-05-04&amp;nofrom=&amp;noto=&amp;count=50&amp;sort=6#searchresult</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that the Podestas look very much like the police sketches: https://i.sli.mg/OGaXaM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that the police sketches show a mole above T. Podesta's eyebrow and that T. Podesta indeed has a mole above his eyebrow: https://i.sli.mg/OGaXaM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that Tony Podesta collects imagery from Biljana Djurdjevic: http://archive.is/JgiQk#selection-1205.0-1207.1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that BilJana Djurdjevic's imagery depicts abducted and abused minors: https://i.sli.mg/CO6j0G</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that Tony Podesta has an "arch of hysteria" sculpture in his home: https://archive.fo/vddrO#selection-3905.217-3905.230</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that the sculpture resembles a victim abducted and killed by Jeffrey Dahmer: https://i.sli.mg/jiPRGc </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that people in Tony Podesta's home were horrified when they found photos in his bedroom from K. Grannan who does naked teenagers: https://archive.fo/vddrO#selection-3905.217-3905.230</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that Tony Podesta was found to have stuffed animals near his bed despite being in his 70s and having no children of his own: https://issuu.com/washingtonlife/docs/wl0615_inside_homes/3 and close up: https://i.sli.mg/RZ8nxV</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that Tony Podesta has been friends with Dennis Hastert for many years and still keeps in touch with him: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48488</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that Dennis Hastert molested multiple children: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/09/us/dennis-hastert-molested-at-least-four-boys-prosecutors-say.html</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone who asserts that none of the above is factual would have to review each link and show specifically why it is false. Simply counter-asserting without argument or downvoting is not a valid response. </p>
<p>Now that we have the cumulative set of facts before us, it is justifiable for people to ask what the explains this set of facts. Whether the facts are best explained as a matter of total coincidence or whether they are best explained as a matter of the Podesta's being involved in child abduction is a determination that readers can make on their own. All we have done is provide verifiable data.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Some people regularly visit r/All and check things out.  I was curious about this post, but it's more crazy ass Alex Jones bullshit.  You haven't linked to a single reputable source yet.  I mean, I can make a website and just say anything, doesn't make it true.  The funniest part about all this, is that if there really was this massive global conspiracy about the Podestas and the Clintons wouldn't she have stolen/rigged the election?  But here we are with President Trump.  The MO doesn't make sense to me, I don't get it...</p></p>

        <p><p>If you view the post on PC you can see % upvoted. If the overall score is like 6000 and it's 70% upvoted you know it's got 70% upvoted and 30% down votes. Then it's pretty easy math to figure out the total numbers.</p></p>

        <p><p>That's because you used a circle-jerky title and made it to /r/all, and then people outside of your little echo chamber saw it, noticed all the bullshit guestimating you used to accuse someone of pedophilia and child abduction, and downvoted this for being incendiary nonsense. But sure, keep telling yourself there's an equally shadowy conspiracy of pedophilic pizza places all designed around downvoting your posts.</p></p>

        <p><p>Bro very little of this is 100% undisputed fact. People are disagreeing with you for being an idiot, not because we are CTR shills. You can't say "SJWs need to learn how to Internet, free speech is the pinnacle of society" and then be unable to handle people down voting your post. There is one standard, free speech is good. It's not "free speech is good for only those who agree with me"</p></p>

<p>Is it proven that they were in Portugal at the time of the abduction? Otherwise this whole list consists of a man that has a weird painting, stuffed animals and is a friend of someone that sexually assaulted people. </p></p>

        <p><p>I just don't understand how anybody could believe this is real. I never really looked into conspiracy theories much, and just wrote them off as a funny distraction from real issues. But holy shit, if this is what all conspiracy theories are like, I don't think I'll ever be able to take them seriously. I apologize to 9/11 truthers. Your theory is Watergate compared to this bullshit.</p>
<p>This "theory" takes so many things that have no correlation to one another, or could be coincidental, and jumps to such wild conclusions with them that it's baffling. This is a true-blue example of someone starting with a statement (i.e. Podesta is a pedophile) and working backwards to find enough things that could be construed as evidence. Half of these "facts" have at least one major flaw in them that would have them thrown out in any court case. Give me a weeks' time and any public figure, and I could "prove" something similar. </p>
<p>Was there nothing else of substance in the Podesta emails that <em>this</em> was the closest thing to an accusation that could be mustered?</p>
<p>Addenda: (1) Could we please stop with creating so many subreddits with barely differing content to fuck with the algorithm?  I don't want to constantly read about how Trump is going to be the best president ever and Hillary and her cronies are going to bring about the End Of Days. (2) No I am not being paid by anybody to say this. I would've voted for Bernie, but begrudgingly voted Hillary. (3) Could we stop adding "-gate" to every single fucking conspiracy theory? Watergate was only called that when there was concrete evidence and Nixon was already found guilty. Adding it to the end doesn't make it any more legitimate, and only serves to make people who want to believe <em>think</em> it's more legitimate.</p></p>

        <p><p>First off, pedo rings are real. The media is going to attempt to dismiss all things negative possibly related to Clinton just like they did to Wikileaks blaming it on alt-right Trump supporters and Russia. This investigation is separate from politics. No one likes pedophiles. FBI has busted many but even they have their limits when some criminals are out of reach. </p>
<p>You should really just read their pizzagate summaries (on the right sidebar) which has the stronger "evidence" laid out before you write up your post. OP's image is terrible and showcased the weakest links of all the things I've seen here. My personal opinion is that there is something going on but this attention is just compromising the investigation.</p></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that the Podestas look very much like the police sketches: https://i.sli.mg/OGaXaM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that the police sketches show a mole above T. Podesta's eyebrow and that T. Podesta indeed has a mole above his eyebrow: https://i.sli.mg/OGaXaM</p>

<p>It is a fact that Tony Podesta collects imagery from Biljana Djurdjevic: http://archive.is/JgiQk#selection-1205.0-1207.1</p>

<p>It is a fact that BilJana Djurdjevic's imagery depicts abducted and abused minors: https://i.sli.mg/CO6j0G</p>

<p>It is a fact that Tony Podesta has an "arch of hysteria" sculpture in his home: https://archive.fo/vddrO#selection-3905.217-3905.230</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that the sculpture resembles a victim abducted and killed by Jeffrey Dahmer: https://i.sli.mg/jiPRGc </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a fact that people in Tony Podesta's home were horrified when they found photos in his bedroom from K. Grannan who does naked teenagers: https://archive.fo/vddrO#selection-3905.217-3905.230</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone who asserts that none of the above is factual would have to review each link and show specifically why it is false. Simply counter-asserting without argument or downvoting is not a valid response. </p>
<p>Now that we have the cumulative set of facts before us, it is justifiable for people to ask what the explains this set of facts. Whether the facts are best explained as a matter of total coincidence or whether they are best explained as a matter of the Podesta's being involved in child abduction is a determination that readers can make on their own. All we have done is provide verifiable data.  </p></p>

        <p><ul>
<li>
<p>Points 1-3 are a classic case of implying causation through correlation. At best, it's a coincidence and is in no way evidence. There is no evidence that he was even in the same country the day her disappearance was reported. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While Point 4 does have some merit (only in that the pictures do resemble the Podestas), remember that these are supposed to be two depictions of <em>the same person</em>. Only one man was seen by the Smiths, and those are attempted depictions of that man. Both of these are compiled images from multiple varying testimonies, and yet the two differ so much despite being the same person. This means that those images are an at-best rough guess, and the fact that they vary that much means that there is no real way to know for sure that the images are accurate. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a side note to 4, the suspect in the Smith sighting was described as being in his mid-thirties and "did not look like a tourist". John and Tony Podesta were 58 and 63 respectively on the night she went missing, and would very much be tourists if they were visiting another country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For point 5, please refer to my point 4 rebuttal. But unless the suspect image is mirrored for some reason, the mole is above his right eyebrow, whereas Tony Podesta's mole is above his left.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Points 6-10 provide no evidence to anything other than Podesta having admittedly weird taste. Weird taste does not define the person, let alone provide evidence to any crime. Specifically, having a work by an artist does not mean they approve of all of the artist's work. Also, having these spread out as five points when they draw the same point seems like padding the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The animals in Point 11 could have just been provided to add some detail to the photo. Professional photographers tend to use props to "liven up" a photo. They don't want to have an empty shelf when taking photos of someone's home for aesthetic purposes. Also, what pedophile would be dumb enough to include things they use to lure children in a photoshoot of their own home?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, Points 12 and 13 imply that an associate of a pedophile is also a pedophile. Keeping someone as a friend despite accusations against them is common in all circles. Also, the email about keeping in touch with Hastert was made in 2015, whereas new evidence regarding the accusation against him was revealed in 2016. Opinions may have changed since then.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Every single point you have made could be interpreted in multiple ways. But none of the points you have mentioned are solid enough to prove anything. Anyone who thinks any of the points mentioned is concrete proof is simply seeing what they want to see. There is a reason the namesake of this theory isn't included in the evidence: It was ludicrous to consider it evidence in the first place.</p></p>

<p>He is in fucking politics, ofc he is not some inbred redneck like you that has never left the country. It is literally his job to work and network with his counterparts around the world. </p>
<p>If you seriously think some american uber pedophile went all the way to portugal to kidnap a no name child you are a fucking idiot. What is so special about madline exept that she was actually killed through the neglect of her parents? Typical brits on holiday, get shitfaced and leave their kids alone so ofc some will go missing.</p></p>

        <p><p>What is the general consensus on Madeline Mccann?  I feel like half the people think it is viable, half think it is a distraction.  Anything more solid revealed yet?  Maybe definitive evidence of location that time period?  Feels like a big jump to me, but I'm not sure if I am missing something</p></p>

        <p><p>The eye witness when he saw Gerry McCann was sure it was him. Two cadaver dogs indicated three different times, in the apartment, outside the balcony and in the boot of their car. Oh and on a book belonging to the mother ad on Maddys teddybear. There was dna evidence that had a match at 15 places out of 19. Two different private detective companies plus the Portugal police came to the conclusion it was the parents. The seven adults who were present didn't have matching stories. </p></p>

        <p><p>I disagree that people "aren't going to find any real evidence through the internet." Everything is through the internet these days. Criminals are humans too and they post to social media and chat rooms. It sounds like you don't even know where Podesta email leaks are from. Even TOR users can be tracked. </p>
<p>First off, read the summary posts on the right which have the much stronger "evidence" for the investigation. The instagram posts are really unsettling. The video where some employee makes some pedo joke during a performance inside the restaurant is more so. Typically you have conspiracy theories grasping at straws for evidence but there's plenty of evidence this time around. It's hard to think nothing is going on at all. I agree that civilians wouldn't be able to contribute much but this will gain the attention of people who do have the skills to help investigate. </p></p>

        <p><p>Do you think the Podestas would be brazen enough to actually kidnap a kid themselves? (Mccain)..Wouldn't they have people to do that for them? I'm not disputing the likeness. I'm just saying they have alot to lose. They were very stupid to pull that off themselves</p></p>

        <p><p>It seems very unlikely that these two could have abducted the girl,  since the parents had already killed her.</p>
<p>Also the police sketches are two drawings of the same man, based on seperate descriptions by a husband and wife who saw one man who looked suspicious. There's no way they could represent both brothers.</p>
<p>Lastly the UK police don't know who did it. That's just a fabrication.</p></p>

        <p><p>So a guy sometimes goes on holiday in a lace where a girl was kidnapped, has art by an artist who also does some rather questionable material, and has toy animals in his bedroom, therefore he's a satanic pedophile?</p>
<p>Also not sure how this is a meme</p></p>

<p>Stop linking everything to Clinton.</p>
<p>The plebs you're trying to convert won't go with it.</p>
<p>They're already connected in that way.</p>
<p>Instead, get them emotionally involved, and only after that let them see that the whole thing was controlled by their party. </p></p>

People saying that your evidence is weak aren't shills, they're just trying to show you that bad research completely undermines any point you were trying to make.

        <p><p>Couple things really;</p>
<p>1) The point about the statue is misleading. There is no evidence to suggest that it was modeled after Dahmer's victim. In fact, looking at the images, there are tons of differences including placement of the arms and legs. I really don't think this is intended to be modeled after the victim. </p>
<p>2) The images of the Madeline McCann suspect are supposed to be of the same person seen by the Smiths, not two people.</p>
<p>3) The police have said they cannot arrest the perpetrators due to international law, but they also said the kidnappers were Portugese and the Madeline McCann abduction was due to a "bungled burglary".</p>
<p>I'm not trying to dissuade anything, there's obviously enough circumstantial evidence to justify an investigation. However, perpetuating this image as "100% fact" is misleading and does not account for lying by omission.</p></p>

        <p><p>Thank you for the thoughtful response. </p>
<p>1) What year did Dahmer kill that victim? What year was the sculpture created? Look at the ribcage, as well as the fact that it's beheaded. None of the traditional renditions of the arch of hysteria were beheaded that I know of. This one is beheaded. Dahmer's victim is beheaded. Check the dates. Is it reality imitating art or vice versa? Google and you will see. </p>
<p>2) That the sketches look very much like the Podestas cannot be disputed.
There have been other suspects as well. The latest list is here: http://findmadeleine.com/campaigns/unidentified_people.html
Police did not conclude with certainty that there was just one suspect; far from it, they only tacitly accepted there was one suspect because that's what they were told during preliminary reports.
It would be contrary to the spirit of rational inquiry to maintain that preliminary reports have veto power over any forthcoming evidence. If new evidence emerges suggesting that more than one suspect was involved, the original suppositions would be revised.</p>
<p>3) That there are reports of a bungled burglary is logically consistent with the explanations being considered. </p></p>

I highly doubt that any Reddit thread is going to lead to a direct conviction of any person; however, that being said, I think we need to be realistic here and realize that the purpose of uncovering information like this is to lead to proper investigation by those in a position to actually do something. </p>
<p>The police photo/sketch may be one man. It doesn't matter if it is not both Podesta brothers. It still has a striking resemblance to John. He clearly has something to hide with his food code. He also is very suspicious considering his choice of friendships and taste in "art". His absence of e-mails prior to the abduction also does not bode well for him. His campaign team's ties to Comet Ping Pong is also very uncomfortable. </p>
<p>Can information like this ever lead to an arrest. Probably not. However, it can lead to someone with the authority to uncover more to be inspired to take action. I have made up my mind that the Podesta's are likely involved in child trafficking at worst and money laundering at least, but that does not mean he will be convicted. Let's get past the semantics people and come back down to Earth.</p>
<p>[EDITS - spelling and addition of Comet Ping Pong bit]</p></p>

        <p><p>Obama administration is tied to large Islamic terrorist group CAIR whose leader was arrested in June 2016 in Florida for child sex trafficking.  Children as young as 10.  Obama's DOJ refused to prosecute.  Judicial watch has a file and they have sued for the records.  The guys name is Ahmed Saleem.  Keith Ellison, congressman, is running to head DNC, and he is closely associated with CAIR.  Ellison has publicly supported this groups terrorism ideology.  More info on One Plaza.com </p></p>

        <p><p>It's a shame the only way to catch a babyfucker is through photos or catching them in the act while people who's vices are drinking and driving and speeding, which hurt a lot less people objectively, get caught and have their whole lives upended.</p>
<p>Not to advocate for any of the above, it's just that perspective is key when considering the worst people who do the most damage destroy their victims at a young age and leave them empty shell's instead of just killing them.  There's near absolutely no way of holding these psycho pieces of shit accountable for turning the world into the economic shithole it currently is.</p>
<p>Babyfucking for the pervert must be what spinach is to Popeye because these pieces of shit sure find a way to get off in nearly all walks of life.</p></p>
