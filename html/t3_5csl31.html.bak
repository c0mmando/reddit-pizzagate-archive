        <strong>Another angle to explore...</strong>
        <p><p>Is there any confirmation that children in the pictures surfacing are still alive? How old are the pictures of the girl having hands taped to the table and the boy being hugged with the necklace around them both? If the photos are somewhat recent, then they'd only be a couple of years older, right? If there parents are willing to post their photos on IG then maybe you'd expect more as they keep growing up?</p></p>
