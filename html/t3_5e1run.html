        <p><p>LOL! Come on man, did you even read the link you posted? It's a fake news site. From that same link, which was posted November 2, 2016: "Military Confirms No Elections in 2016."</p>
<p>Kent Dunn: Sir what is going to happen with the election?</p>
<p>Military Colonel: “When we’re done, what election?”</p>
<p>Do you remember a week and a half ago? Was there an election, or did the military cancel it? If there was an election, how credible do you think this source is?</p></p>

        <p><p>https://mainerepublicemailalert.com/2016/11/21/unbelievable-billboard-near-dearborn-michigan</p>
<p>Here's an article they posted today claiming a billboard was posted in front of an Islamic Centre in Dearborn with the message "America we will kill you all", showing a picture as proof which was clearly made in 2 minutes using Photoshop or similar. Completely fucking fake news with an agenda. It astonishes me that people build up ideologies and fully formed opinions based on these wildly speculative claims that can be checked in 30 seconds to be bullshit. People just do not care if what they are saying is true.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's a real threat to democracy and even national security. The combination of an open society and an uncensored Internet opens the door for manipulation by foreign powers, or at the very least, simply a massively uninformed population immune to facts living in their own reality, disjoint from the actual one the rest of us live in.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is one of the largest displays of circular logic and conclusion-jumping I've ever seen. Jesus Christ. You've connected Benghazi, the Haiti earthquake, the Clinton Foundation,  Jeff Epstein, Wikileaks, and "photos of the Clintons having sex with children", all based on a lot of admittedly weird shit but pretty much zero evidence. Come on folks even if you disagree with me you can not actually take this infographic seriously</p></p>
