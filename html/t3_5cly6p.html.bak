        <strong>ATTENTION: WE NEED A NEW, CENTRAL PLACE TO POST AND DISCUSS EVIDENCE. URGENT.</strong>
        <p><p>So I have been shadowbanned on my other account I've been using to post evidence. I only just realized it after I made several posts and saw that no one was upvoting or commenting. It is my understanding that many others are experiencing this as well. We immediately need to come up with one safe and central place where we can maintain all of the evidence at the very least, but it would be great if we had a central place to communicate without censorship as well. People are probably posting tons of evidence that is not coming to light because they may not realize they've been shadowbanned. Leave your thoughts please. Let's figure something out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Edit: Please upload all evidence you have onto this Github repository according to the instructions <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5clut3/created_a_github_repo_to_fight_the_censorship/">here</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If anyone else has created a safe place for uploading evidence and/or communicating without censorship, let me know and I'll review it to add to this post. Also, if you have further suggestions for personal or collaboration tools people can use to simplify our investigative process, let us know that in comments as well. More to come. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Please also continue to post your evidence on r/pizzagate after you've uploaded your evidence to the git repository for safekeeping. It's important because we need to continue to build this subreddit. As always, archive everything before you make any evidence public. Keep up the great work everyone. High energy. Let's destroy these pedos and save the children!</strong></p>

        <p><p>It's too much of an open public forum here on Reddit.  Reddit pulls a wider innocent audience but at the cost of being countered by the bad guys.  If you want to counter the bad guys then 4chan/8chan would be the best bet.  They're pretty much fucked there.  Complainers will be told to fuck off or targeted.  This stuff is already in the open out of the darknet.</p></p>

        <p><p>/v/news has fewer subscribers than /r/uncensorednews does. The main news sub is considerably less active than a small offshoot on Reddit is. Niche subs on Voat never catch on and die out much more quickly than niche subs on Reddit, as well.</p></p>

        <p><p>You said no one uses it and it is not maintained which are both not true. I am not comparing it to Reddit. Yes Reddit has more active users. So what? The OP was looking for a place to post and discuss without fear of censorship and Voat is just such a place. OP was not asking for most popular place....Why trash Voat? If no one uses it, then should not bother you.</p></p>

        <p><p>Voat will welcome you guys. One of you posted the Olsen pizza song on Voat and linked to this place. This is my first reddit comment in about 2 years. Voat is great, maybe more for the mature audience. But since Pizzagate is a rather 'mature topic' I thought to reach out a hand and welcome you to check out Voat.</p></p>

        <p><p>Go to voat.  Reason why things are going to get deleted is probably because FBI already has an investigation and this will ruin everything they've collected.  Like spooking a deer you've been hunting.  </p>
<p>We KNOW the NYPD knows about this stuff.  There are also cases they do this to blackmail foreign dignitaries.  Its been done for a long time.  Russians did this during the cold war.  </p></p>

<p>Or maybe because witchhunting and publishing personal information was never allowed on reddit? (Well witchhunting was, but not after the boston thing)</p></p>

        <p><p>Guys I have an idea for this and have used this method for a year it works.  We can use a  collaberative table solution so any number of people can free flow organically add to the document a piece which records the date of evidence detail, archive link and link and tag. Thats it. then set it loose.  very quickly the picture will form of how it all links together. As the tag web builds later  we can then categorise the evidence with more detailed tags that link the individual submissions to individual cases that link together into the bigger picture.</p>
<p>I have been trying to find help for this but usually the one word bogus answer trick shoots it down before it is considered.   I really think this will cause a huge revealing.  We have many coders, is this very simple to do? is there something that exists already we can use for this?</p></p>

        <p><p>There are a few points that are critical:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The images &amp; Zips. Mirroring this data could be fatal because we dont know what is actually contained. "Owning" child pornography in any way (even if you cant access it) is illegal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Drawing connections" can and will be interpreted as defamation &amp; slender. Owning a domain, and therefore having data "public" does not make you to a public person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pictures and texts are not owned by you, therefore could they be DCMA'd. Ignoring such a request is also illegal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably a few more points. Also something like reddit can not simply be seized. If police thinks one of the above points is the case (which it is obviously, the question is when they realize that) they are able to seize the servers, so hosting anywhere else than in a country that simply does not care would most likely not work for long.</p></p>

        <p><p>Lots of people are saying IRC but I think a Discord may be better since it loads images immediately. I know multiple nazi groups that haven't been banned on Discord, so I think we'd be safe there with this topic as well.</p></p>
