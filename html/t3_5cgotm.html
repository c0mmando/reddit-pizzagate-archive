        <strong>Obama does cocaine. Has anyone else found drug references?</strong>
        <p><p>-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obama had written in his first book, "Dreams From My Father" (1995), before entering politics, that he had used marijuana and cocaine ("maybe a little blow"). He said he had not tried heroin because he did not like the pusher who was trying to sell it to him.

<blockquote>
<p>Pretty typical though. I would not be surprised if wjc told him to do it. Just as I'm pretty sure mark Penn didn't do his cocaine rang against Obama without some higher up approval.

        <p><p>Cocaine is addictive, Obama probably does cocaine still. This means Comet Ping Pong could be involved in drug trafficking. Obama is also open to blackmail if he is a cocaine user, or could even be blow buddies with Clinton. It could also mean that this whole thing is linked to past Clinton conspiracies

<p>Pizzeria are also used frequently in drug trafficking rings

<p>They use a lot products that you can hide drugs in (cans, bags of flour etc.) and they also have a large amount of cash flowing through the business making it easy to launder their drug money.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Cocaine has very obvious long term effects. Obama has none of them. Its also very possible that Obama just asked an aide or someone he knew to just set something up and he had no knowledge. While the Clintons are into some super super awful things, Obama's corruption and lying is a completely different kind and very very tame in comparison.</p></p>
