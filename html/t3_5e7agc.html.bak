        <strong>Ben Jones: Artist and Hollywood Creator on Jeffrey Dietrich's website (JD is best friends with Jeff Koons who is connected to David Brock/Comet Pizza)</strong>
        <p><p>Ben Jones is an artist that Jeffrey Dietrich held an exhibition for at his gallery in 2009. Ben Jones also helped with the design of Jeffrey Dietrich's website (www.dietrich.com). Jeffrey Dietrich is a high-end art advisor (he started Citibank's Art Advisory in 1979). He is also best friends with Jeff Koons. My investigation into this nexus started with the article below which places Jeff Koons, Jeffrey Dietrich, and Marina Abramovic in Qatar together. That's tangentially interesting because Qatar has been funding ISIS and promotes Wahhabism which is essentially a satanic form of Islam IMO complete with blood rituals (sending enemy soldiers to hell by forcing them to eat the dead bodies of fellow soldiers?). Also, see Hector Morenco's tweets explaining HRC - Qatar pipeline link.

<p>If you're not familiar with Jeff Koons' connections to James Alefantis and David Brock et al, go here:

<p>Here are pictures from Jeff Koon's 50th birthday party which Jeffrey Dietrich threw him. Dietrich says, "Jeff Koons is the artist with whom Iâ€™ve had the closest dialogue and the strongest friendship during my four decades in the art world."

<p>It's ironic that Jeffrey Dietrich was in Qatar, which funds ISIS, because he has an art exhibit dedicated to the plight of the Syrian refugees, a situation caused by ISIS. You can go here to read about the exhibit and why he is passionate about the refugees:

<p>So who is Ben Jones? He is an artist who says in an interview he was influenced by his mother who is a "high priestess" of western and non-western spirituality. Now she is a licensed spiritualist that "talks to the dead" for people. You can find that in the interview here:

<p>Here is his wikipedia page:

<p>Here is some info on his bizarre New Dark Age exhibit:

<p>Here are some interviews about the exhibit that references his "abiding interest in sacred geometry and occult esoterica":

<p>You can see in this image the 3-symbol hand symbol called "Sign of Elder Gods" which is how the occult control spirits and protect themselves while conjuring spirits. It also looks like the person in the bed is being harassed, or at least terrified, by a spirit but the exact meaning is unclear.

<p>Here he decorated a room with ping pong tables:

<p>Here is another image with an old man, with a strange hand symbol, that frequently shows up in his art. I don't know what it means. I've seen it referenced as an "inverse satan" symbol but not gotten further than that.

<p>Here's another image with the 3-finger salute:

<p>Ben Jones now works in Hollywood. He created the television show Problem Solverz (2007) that was on the Carton Network. He created the pilot Neon Knome which aired on Adult Swim in 2010. He created the show Stone Quackers which aired in 2014 on Fox.</p>
<p>This is not smoking gun for the pedo network nor am I claiming Ben Jones is involved in that side of it. It's another small step in exposing this strange nexus of pizza parlors and ping pong / art / politics / the occult. </p></p>
