        <strong>Carrying This Weight</strong>
        <p><p>I'm sure there are others out there struggling to take care of their own well being while researching this. This hits home for me in many different ways. Anyone chatting anywhere right now? I feel like I need a support group on here but how the hell do you manage that without just getting trolled or talking to shills? luckily I got my parents to slow down and listen to me enough today that they are now confident I'm not insane, I'm sure others aren't so lucky. Just remember you aren't alone.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah the problem is I've been aware of this for over half my life now (32) and put it aside daily to live a fairly creative happy and compassionate life. I'm very empathic and the fact that thousands are waking up to evil has me unable to calm down. I also have been in a position that lead me very near being victimized and have lost loved ones who were abused. I'm barely reading info anymore - just trying to get back on an even keel.</p></p>

        <p><p>Sucks the only response so far is essentially telling me to do something other than talk to others about this. Family and friends do come first but sharing common trauma is helpful in its own right to bring us back to center.</p></p>

        <p><p>Not really. Start with your most trusted and establish a baseline and make sure you both have time to be calm and patient and hear one another out. I don't recommend yelling at them that if they love you they'll not hang up on you and listen. That tactic set me back a couple of hours.</p></p>

        <p><p>There is a way.  You need to spread the movement; the more people in general that know about this, the more people who would be willing to talk with you about it.</p>
<p>Of course, you can always just talk with us here on this sub ;D</p></p>

        <p><p>Hey bud,
I've got 2 kids do this is on my mind all the time.  </p>
<p>I used to read a lot about freemasons and the illuminati since I was 15 and the satanic cults surrounding them. </p>
<p>All this information that is coming out only provides more in believing in people's evil actions.  </p>
<p>Sometimes it's so overwhelming and probably like yourself I sometimes felt like I was going insane for the simple fact that no one ever believed me. </p>
<p>But somehow just keep pushing.  One day I did find someone really educated and you need someone that knows what's going on but brings you down to a reasonable level.  </p>
<p>These last few weeks has been crazy though.  And I feel like my mind is working overtime.  And I feel so sick for these kids.  Specially the ones that are left to suffer dieing.  </p></p>

<p>There's already a thread about this towards the top.  There's a few good responses.  Go talk to them in there.  It's a heavy burden to shoulder, OP.</p></p>

        <p><p>That's okay, OP. It really is a heavy burden  to shoulder.  I keep having waking nightmares where I come across a For Sale list, and my daughters on it.  Terrifying stuff.  </p></p>
