        <strong>Guccifer wanted us to know this months ago</strong>
        <p><p>Guccifer was the Romanian hacker that hacked into Hillary's server and he was the reason we found out about the server in the first place.</p>
<p>Since his letter is quite lengthy I will go ahead and paraphrase something very important very few people seem to be paying attention to. In the letter to Fox news he states:
“Hillary Rodham Diane Clinton is one of the high priests, a goddess of this ocult, satanic, shadow group. One must see their evil and profoundly corrupt nature to understand what I am talking about."</p>
<p>This matters because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We saw the spirit cooking stuff (satanic and also involves children/effigies of children)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We see emails from a top Hillary aid about Moloch (God of child sacrafice)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then we see all of the numerous connection the clintons have to pedophilia (Weiner and so on)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As of right now I understand that this is all considered "conspiracy", but there is an avalanche of evidence piling up for this pizzagate concept. </p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>The Romenian authorities query that I have to be sent back home “right away”, is a silly, hasty move, by the way.
I will not leave this beautiful country without saying that the “Guccifer Project” was a failed project. My will / intention was to fully expose the Illuminati / the Council, and their crimes, but I failed!
Hillary Rodham Diane Clinton is one of the high priests, a goddess of this ocult, satanic, shadow group. One must see their evil and profoundly corrupt nature to understand what I am talking about.
Though I know I invested a great deal of time &amp; effort trying to expose the crimes of the Rockefellers, the Bush klan, the Clinton, and many others, maybe my skills (or lack of skills?) were NOT matching my faith.
So, I apologize in front of the unknown soldiers who struggle to take this fight against these monsters to a glorious end. Many of ’em are risking their lives, while doing this behind the computer screens, from inside or outside the system.</p>

        <p><p>He didn't fail, he was just looking in the wrong places. He was on the right track. The Roman Catholics is what he missed. The jesuits and the black pope. The people who <em>truly</em> rule the world through their blackmail pedophilia, ancient banks, and occult rituals. <a href="http://childabuserecovery.com/pope-francisbergoglio-queen-elizabeth-charged-for-child-trafficking/">There's something truly fucked up with the Jesuits</a> and this stuff will never stop until they're wiped out.</p>
<p>To anyone reading this, know that Podesta is a Jesuit. So is Tim Kaine. Go to the Podesta WikiLeaks and search the term "Jesuit" and you'll be blown away. Then search "Malta" or "Knights of Malta", they're a Jesuit order. They went to Haiti around the same time the Clinton Foundation was there.</p></p>

        <p><p>No one group "truly runs the world."   Money doesn't care about race or religion.   The international ruling class is made up of multiple groups from multiple countries.   Money is power.  </p></p>

        <p><p>I agree 100%. The group is fairly large, numbering at least in the thousands, and it is not as tightly coordinated as we may think.</p>
<p>That's why people looking for a small group that is ordering everything always fail, even though they do realize that some group may have accumulated a lot of power.</p></p>

        <p><p>I can't agree with this at all. If anyone cares enough to look into r/RomeRules and how we're still ruled by the Holy Roman Empire, it will be a red-pill so large it's difficult to swallow. Every single road leads back to Rome. You say money is power, and you're right. Guess who holds all the money? Roman Catholics. Look into <a href="https://youtu.be/PY0X3dGgMok">The Black Nobility</a> and you will see where the money is and who holds the power. They own all the banks, the IMF, federal reserve, media, military, everything. And every country that doesn't accept their rule gets wiped out by the United States which is a property of the Vatican.</p></p>

        <p><p>Sorry, I'm not buying it.   You're ignoring the power of various other religious and ethnic groups, whether Anglos, Jews, atheists, increasingly Chinese etc.   If the Catholic Church was so powerful they would have been able to coverup their pedophile scandals via media control (like Hollywood is currently doing).   Not saying the Vatican has no power, but not to the degree you're suggesting.  </p></p>

        <p><p>If you actually spent a couple of days researching the complete, nefarious history of the Vatican you wouldn't be saying that.</p>
<p>There's nothing more worthless and pointless than someone speculating as true that they don't believe something, when they don't know $hit about it.  Do some research.  Then you won't be saying it.  Because it's true...the Jesuit creed is actually a part of the Congressional Record because in 1912 congressmen were so disturbed at reading it, they insisted it become part of the record.</p>
<p>The Jesuits are IN EVERYTHING.  Hide EVERYWHERE. Temples, non-Catholic religions, gov't, you name it.  Again, do some research on the miseries the RCC has perpetrated on the humans on this earth before you speculate what you 'think' or do 'not think' is freaking true.  SMH.</p></p>

        <p><p>I get so fucking tired of people burying their heads in the sand about the jesuits simply because they've never heard of them. Like dude.. there's a reason you've never heard of them.</p>
<p>You can present someone with all the evidence in the world- or even a simple thing like the fact that the <em>goddamn statue on the United States capitol building is a fucking sculpture from Rome or that Roman words are printed on our currency</em> and they'll just go "nah you're a conspiracy theorist." </p>
<p>I realize it's a deep dive but the only way people will ever wake up and stop being controlled is to open their eyes and see who's controlling them.</p></p>

        <p><p>I hear ya man.  I grew up in that cult, went to rcc schools until 5th grade, when some nut burned down the church next door.  At least I thought he was a nut <em>at the time</em>.</p>
<p>One of the first places I went down TRH was the history of the Vatican.  That led me to so many places, like symbology research, Jesuits, French Revolution,...you name it.  They have their mitts in everything.</p>
<p>For a while I still dismissed it and went to other places down the rabbit hole--but it <em>kept</em> leading me back to the freaking Vatican.  Eighteen hundred years of acquiring wealth stolen from the gullible, the weak and the wicked...you think that all just disappeared?  Of course not...</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't have time to go into this but just know that the Jews are pawns to the jesuits. And I avoid the word "catholic" for a reason. It's the Roman Catholics. Regular ass Catholic people have no idea what is going on. Roman Catholicism and the Jesuits are a <em>very</em> different thing. In the simplest terms think of it this way: the Jews are the bankers and the Jesuits are the bank. The more you look and if you actually care to do research, the more you will see and the more your mind will be blown. The jesuits write history, everything we know about the world is wrong.</p></p>

        <p><p>The Jesuit Order are really the Knights Templar and they were behind the 9/11 attacks. That specific day was picked because if you do the requisite research, you will discover Jesus was born on September 11, 3 BC. The Romans killed Jesus and they wanted to usher in the AntiChrist on Jesus' real birthday in 2001.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yep, you got it. Lots of people need to get educated on this but ignorance really gets in the way. The only way we will ever free ourselves is if everyone wakes up to the Romans' rule over us and we take our country back from them.</p></p>

        <p><p>The Black Nobility video was horrible. Just showed a bunch of old pictures at the end. Some creepy photos, but nothing that made me think that the world is being run by a secret organization from Rome. Too much of the world has changed for it to still be kept under the thumb of the "rulers" </p></p>

        <p><p>I just made a quick search because I had seen that info before. Looks like the article I linked piggybacked off <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/crime-all-stars/2014/02/pope-bergoglio-queen-elizabeth-charged-for-child-trafficking-2448440.html">this one</a> that also got the dude's name incorrect but that's so far beside the point. Point is, Pope Francis is the first Jesuit Pope. He's been implicated in child trafficking multiple times and the blind ass internet still thinks he's "the cool pope" because <a href="http://jesuits.m.webs.com/site/mobile?dm_path=%2Fmedia%2Dcontrol&amp;amp;fw_sig_is_admin=0&amp;amp;fw_sig_access_token=1dc71de537d9561ff545e3a2b7b0eb5baae1d629&amp;amp;fw_sig_premium=0&amp;amp;fw_sig_permission_level=0&amp;amp;fw_sig_api_key=522b0eedffc137c934fc7268582d53a1&amp;amp;fw_sig_site=115012832&amp;amp;fw_sig_url=http://jesuits.webs.com/&amp;amp;fw_sig_partner=webs&amp;amp;fw_sig_session_key=6d6cb4affb1e1ad50d98f3b148c4f3f7e2f6fa3d8c2631ff98fa8f356db2aba7-115012832&amp;amp;fw_sig_permissions=none&amp;amp;fw_sig=a364bce29febdd900faf2641015a52c7&amp;amp;fw_sig_time=1479266912244&amp;amp;fw_sig_tier=0&amp;amp;fw_sig_social=1&amp;amp;fw_sig_locale=en-US&amp;amp;fb_sig_network=fw#0033">the entirety of the media is owned by jesuits</a> and it's what they want you to think</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm starting to wonder if Assange had any fingers in this pedo ring. Whether guilty or not of such deeds, he hasn't been seen or heard from in a month, there were rumors of military geared men being seen at the embassy the day his internet was cut, there was that set up where they tried to frame him for that website.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just paranoid but I'm wondering if he was involved and threatened to expose it, and everything released thus far was all of the other shit he found while digging for the pedos.</p></p>

        <p><p>Podesta is <strong>not</strong> a Jesuit. He is Catholic and attended Georgetown, a university founded and run by Jesuits.</p>
<p>Tim Kaine is <strong>not</strong> a Jesuit. He is Catholic and attended a high school run by Jesuits. Neither his undergraduate degree nor law degree are from a Jesuit university.</p>
<p>To be  a "Jesuit," one must have received holy orders through the Society of Jesus (S. J.), thereby becoming a Priest in the Roman Catholic Church. Prior to holy orders, one is a "Scholastic" and will spend about 10 years earning one or more Ph.D. degrees and teaching. </p>
<p>Jesuits are primarily focused on academics - research and teaching.  Each member takes a vow of poverty.</p></p>

        <p><p>Go search Podestas WikiLeaks for "jesuit" and "knights of Malta"</p>
<p>Every time the jesuits are mentioned someone always comes in and tries to make the Jesuits out to be good guys. That's not happening here. They are awful people and have done a lot of bad things all over the world.</p></p>

        <p><p>Norton did a doco on him, in the doco he warns everyone that something terrible is going to happen and Hillary is the one behind it all... maybe her plan went up shit creek hence she went loco when Trump won, if this is all true they are going to throw everything they have at Trump. He needs to continue the swamp draining. </p></p>

<p>Wasn't that an email Cheryl Mills forwarded from their rep to the OAS? Or were there other Moloch references in these leaked emails?</p></p>

        <p><p>The owl/minerva rule sounds like they are referring to a well known insider philosophy, kinda like "remember to keep your ducks in a row"</p></p>

        <p><p>Has anyone else noticed that in the top margin of the letter there's a 2 circled? My guess is there's an entire first page of this that was omitted. Also, why crop out his signature?</p></p>
