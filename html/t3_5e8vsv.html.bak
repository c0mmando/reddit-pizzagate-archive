        <p><p>I read through this website a few years ago and learned a lot. I don't want to paraphrase it becasue there is so much to learn, but basically in the 1980s there was a big investigation into a DC child sex ring and a lot of the investigators and witnesses died really strange deaths mid-way through the investigation. The investigation centers around a guy named Larry King (not from the TV show) who sang the national anthem at the 1989 (or 1988?) republican national convention </p></p>

        <p><p>Yes! I was wondering about this. Have you listened to the true crime podcast Sword and Scale about this? He has a couple very detailed episodes about secret pedo rings in Washington and high up politicians. I'm going to give it another listen for sure and see if I can do more research. </p></p>
