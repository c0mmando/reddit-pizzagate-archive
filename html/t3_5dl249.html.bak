        <strong>BREAKING: MegaPost - Two new leads connecting podesta/clinton cabinet to childrens orphanage trafficking</strong>
        <p><p>Pastebin version with full URL paths (recommended): http://pastebin.com/C9LCYwP0</p>
<p>Hundreds of American Indians are disappearing at an alarming rate as published below.

<p>Keys points from articles:
"Chris Stark, a researcher focusing on sex trafficking on the ships in Duluth’s port, agreed. “There’s a connection between like the reservations and places like Bemidji and Duluth and the Twin Cities [Minneapolis/St Paul] in terms of the trafficking and prostitution routes that are run,” he said."</p>
<p>"For Nikki Crowe, 44, a resident of the reservation, there are common misconceptions. “Most of the time trafficking isn’t like the movie version of trafficking where a child is snatched off the streets. It’s more like, we’ve already been [violated] in so many ways, from historical trauma, to the addiction, to the sexual abuse that we don’t talk about as communities, to the things that have happened at the boarding schools and the breakdown of our communities and our families."</p>
<p>"“'It’s pretty much ignored when Native women go missing”,' said Carmen O’Leary, who runs the Native Women’s Society of the Great Plains, a tribal coalition that focuses on issues of domestic violence, sexual assault and sex trafficking"</p>
<p>"While tough conditions on reservations may be one factor pushing women into trafficking, Larsen said that disappearances and trafficking often coincide with other phenomena such as gang activity on reservations, oil drilling in North Dakota or ships entering Duluth’s international port. “Follow the pipeline through, you follow the construction workers, you follow the money, you follow the oil – you’ll start seeing where the trafficking will follow that,” she said. She says that hunger often pushed these women to accept invitations to “parties” on the ships. Stark said that the parties were presented as a good time with lots of food and drink, but that women were not always aware that they would be expected to provide sexual services. What’s more she said, the “parties” could have even more serious consequences. “[The sailors] will ply [the women] with alcohol, and they’ll wake up and they’ll be on their way to Thunder Bay [in Canada] listening to someone talking about who they’re going to sell them to.”"</p>
<p>"Critics say foster care in South Dakota has become a powerhouse for private group home providers who bring in millions of dollars in state contracts to care for kids. Among them is Children's Home Society, the state's largest foster care provider, which has close ties with top government officials. It used to be run by South Dakota's Gov. Dennis Daugard. An NPR investigation has found that Daugard was on the group's payroll while he was lieutenant governor — and while the group received tens of millions of dollars in no-bid state contracts. It's an unusual relationship highlighting the powerful role money and politics play in South Dakota's foster care system."</p>
<p>So who is responsible for handling the 'affairs' of Native Americans? The United States Department of Interior or rather the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

<p>Remember who was in one of the first cheesy podesta e-mails? Sandler Foundation
http://tinyurl.com/hcswn47</p>
<p>Same Sandler guy suggesting a Dianne as the next Secretary of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4758</p>
<p>Just an extra e-mail inserted about how connected these guys are and how positions are actually selected. Although from the selections it would seem like the majority of the major figures of Native Americans have been bought out.
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/45686</p>
<p>An e-mail chain to Podesta about who should becoming the Secretary of Interior
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/29561</p>
<p>Notice how the second e-mail says "issues"?
"This may be an idiotic idea and I have no idea if he's interested, but what about Tim Wirth?  He has the interior west background, knows how to manage a department, and a long background in the issues."</p>
<p>Podesta ended up deciding to go with Ken Salazar
The same Ken Salazar below who was AG during a child rape case and hid information. This was an actual case recorded in the US law archives.</p>

SECOND LEAD
===================================================================================</p>
<p>Clinton traveled to Mother Teresa's Indian  Calcutta orphanage when she first met her at a speech.
http://tinyurl.com/h4nabqw</p>
<p>She then visisted the orphanages again when mother theresa passed away as noted below.
http://tinyurl.com/zeffnrb</p>
<p>A sister from that same orphanage was arressted for selling children
http://tinyurl.com/79rekap</p>
<p>In 2015 the Indian orphanage stopped allowing adoptions. That same year India passed a new law that mandated that orphanages must use a stricter government systems. </p>
<p>Quotes from the article below:
"Previously, orphanages around the country were allowed to hand-pick parents and match them with children. But that process, officials said, operated with scant oversight and was plagued by corruption, trafficking, delays, favouritism and prejudice."</p>
<p>"Thirty orphanages run by a group founded by Mother Teresa have decided to close their adoption services in India rather than comply with a new government system that will make it easier for single and divorced people to adopt."</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/opjx3v3</p>
<p>Additional Notes on Mother Teresa's controversy
http://tinyurl.com/optzj9a</p>
<p>Hindu perception of Mother Teresa
http://tinyurl.com/hwh39ve</p>
<p>Wikileaks e-mail concerning mother teresa.
https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3553</p>
<p>Conclusion: Clinton founded an orphanage with Mother Theresa in a rich area of Washington back when she was first lady. She talked about it in a speech around 2008-2010 and was told later by Philippe Reines via e-mail that the orphanage she was talking about had closed. There was mentions about her talking about the orphanage after it closed in her autobiography as well. Mother Theresa has controversies tied to child trafficking and i don't find it a coincidence that they closed their orphanages right after India added a more strict system with government records of adoptions so orphanages are regulated. Additionally it is noted that Mother Teresa horded millions that later went to the catholic church while the conditions for the orphans were horrible.</p></p>

        <p><p>OP, please edit to show that this is two different leads.  You don't include a new heading when you transition to talking about India, so it makes it look like you're confusing American "Indians" with Indians.</p></p>

        <p><p>This would be during the time Christopher Hitchens wrote of both the Clinton's AND Mother Theresa. He's dead now, cancer. He was a heavy drinker and smoker so no one really was surprised. But is it possible to give someone cancer? (Serious Question)</p></p>

        <p><p>It is possible to give someone cancer, but that method generally indicates institutional/state involvement (not so easy to purchase the ingredients).</p>
<p>polonium 210 has been used. its rare, but a hallmark is the speed of deterioration. healthy to bed in 3 days. bed to dead in 30 days, even in a hospital.</p>
<p>Generally if someone has a lifestyle known to cause cancer, such as heavy smoking, its a good idea to assume its naturally caused cancer.</p></p>

        <p><p>So, during the LDS Presidency of Spencer Kimball and alarming number of Navajo children were forced into foster care and abused on a massive scale.</p>
<p>http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/04/05/navajo-siblings-claim-horrific-sexual-abuse-sue-mormons-164024</p>
<p>http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/why-some-native-americans-are-suing-the-mormon-church/504944/</p>
<p>http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/06/lawsuit-mormons-sexually-abused-navajo-foster-children.html</p>
<p>Later, the Pace Memorandum would surface that shows that Satanic Ritual abuse was happening in the temple, itself. Children aren't allowed in the temple, so the general authorities of the church were convinced when the children detailed the insides of the Salt Lake temple, where they claimed children were being sacrificed at an altar under the west end.</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pace_memorandum</p>
<p>http://www.utlm.org/newsletters/pdfnewsletters/80saltlakecitymessenger.pdf</p>
<p>Spencer Kimball's grandson of the same name funded the construction of an orphanage in the Dominican Republic. The DREAM Center. The Kimballs also own a $30,000 a week resort nearby.</p>
<p>A cable mentions 10 Americans from Idaho arrested for trafficking children. They claim they are headed to the Dominican Republic to establish an orphanage.</p>
<p>https://www.wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3765</p>
<p>The only orphanage being established at that time was the DREAM Center.</p>
<p>Michel Zaleski gave money to Hillary.</p>
