        <p><p>This entire pedophile business has had me more captivated than any tv show ever. I've been completely full of suspense ever since people started noticing the code-speak in the Podesta emails. Now that we are seeing ties to supposed "humanitarian" organizations, Haiti, Madeline McCann, etc, this whole thing is only getting juicer. There could not be a better time for an outsider like Trump to have just won the election. My thoughts and prayers are with Wikileaks, the FBI, and all of the weaponized autists who dig up new information every day. I sincerely hope the good guys win this one. </p></p>
