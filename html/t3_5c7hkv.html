        <strong>/r/Pizzagate</strong>
        <p><p>Hey you guys, I just want to point out that the only reason this whole thing has any momentum right now is because for the first while it was being discussed in popular subs like /r/the_donald and /r/conspiracy.</p>
<p>I understand that consolidating the research into 1 sub is beneficial for organizing it, but right now repetition is our friend. If people stop seeing Pizzagate often, they will disregard it, it's that simple. Even if they see some bombshell later on, people don't like changing their minds.</p>
<p>I suggest you post everything that you post here also on the subs you were using prior to /r/Pizzagate. Maintain an audience.</p>
<p>Great work and keep digging</p></p>

        <p><p>Eh it was kinda hit and miss imo. A lot of great questions got answered, but a lot of great questions got ignored. I guess that's like all AMAs though. </p></p>

        <p><p>Up to 2400+. Something that's an obvious worry now is making sure the mods don't get infiltrated CTR-style. I don't think they will, but it's important to keep in mind. </p></p>

        <p><p>I also hope that we will continue to have good new content, though I suppose it depends on how quickly Wikileaks gets emails out.</p>
<p>It would also be nice to hear from FBI Anon again.  He is the one that first pointed us to the CTR connection with child sex trafficking.  I wonder if he will post on 4chan again...</p></p>

        <p><p>From what I have seen, most of the research is going on at /pol/ on 4chan.  It is not easy to keep up with the discoveries there, and threads 404 pretty quickly.  You can go through the archives, but you still have to wade through endless shitposts and people going down the wrong path before you get to good information.</p>
<p>The problem with the popular subs is that speculation and info of little importance will be hidden by more popular posts.  We also need a place dedicated to preserving the good research leads for those who want to dig deeper.</p>
<p>In short, is place needs to stay open.  Big discoveries should absolutely be cross-posted onto more popular subs, and we should do everything we can to spread the word that this subreddit exists.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's been interesting seeing how the left tries to explain away the emails and evidence on the Wikileaks AMA thread.  There's no plausible explanation, and I think they know it.  The legitimacy of the emails is what kills them - they have to have an explanation, and none is forthcoming.</p>
<p>I've got a feeling that there will be a number of arrests in January.</p></p>
