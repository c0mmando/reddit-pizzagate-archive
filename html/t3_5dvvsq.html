        <strong>Most disturbing passage from "the Franklin Cover-up" (warning: NSFL)</strong>
        <p><p>I'm reading John DeCamp's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Franklin-Cover-up-Satanism-Murder-Nebraska/dp/0963215809">"The Franklin Cover-up,"</a> which you all should check out, along with the documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY-F5JoHoho">"Conspiracy of Silence."</a></p>
<p>This is the most disturbing passage I've come across so far in the book. Paul Bonacci is one of the child victims who came forth to tell his story about being abused by Republican big-wig Larry King. This guy is connected to George Bush Sr. by the way. Are they talking about THAT Hunter Thompson I wonder??</p>

        <p><p>Wish I hadn't read that.</p>
<p>Edit: I also remember hearing that it was THAT Hunter Thompson. I can't remember which podcast, but they mentioned it either on The Corbett Report or episode 5 or 6 of the Sword and Scale podcast. They also mentioned that he was killed for trying to blackmail someone in this group rather than committing suicide.  </p>
<p>Edit 2: It was mentioned in episode 6 of the Sword and Scale podcast at around 29 minutes. They play an interview with Bonacci saying he was approached to make snuff films. He said Thompson was involved in making those snuff films as well and that he felt that Thompson's death was not a suicide. </p></p>

        <p><p>Thompson is known to have had a collection of snuff films. You don't get to be that fucked up and that famous unles you're in with the pedos too. He was not a good man</p></p>

        <p><p>Holy shit. Well deserved NSFL warning.</p>
<p>Need to show this to /u/BeyondWikipedia who thinks this is "all a coincidence" and /u/VOICEOFREASONDC who claims a DC pedophile ring "just wouldn't be possible". Although I doubt it'll change their minds. Confronting worldview-altering material with a level head and open mind is asking a lot of people.</p></p>

        <p><p>Is it really that far-fetched to think that the same satanic cult responsible for this, is also connected to Comet Ping Pong? In both cases, we have VERY high-up elites involved. And we know that the elites know each other and protect each other. </p></p>

<p>Edit: to be more clear, if you look into the Franklin story with a level head you'll find that it's a well-known hoax and that Decamp is not credible.</p></p>

        <p><p>Can anyone explain to me how being satanic and being a pedophile aren't even close to normal human behavior, yet somehow every single politician and famous person are accused of being such things? What does becoming famous do to people that makes them have a craving to fuck children? The pattern people are claiming just makes zero sense.</p></p>

        <p><p>I can't remember where but I read that they do it for 3 reasons . 1) They want to show that they can trust eachother by participating in the most vile things imaginable. 2) They want to have dirt on eachother to prevent backstabbing. 3) They want to prove they are sadistic enough to do whatever it takes to rule.</p></p>

        <p><p>Rusty Nelson is a 'photographer' who worked for Larry King, was seemingly abused and then paid to recruit for him. There's an interview on Youtube, he says it is indeed the Hunter Thompson. Reckons Thompson was making snuff films and paying big money.</p></p>
