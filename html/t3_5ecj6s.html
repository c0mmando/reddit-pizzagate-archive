        <strong>PR PUSH FOR #PIZZAGATE</strong>
        <p><p>Folks, there are enough "MSM" types of reports on this now - NYT, City Paper, Inquisitor, DailyMail, etc.</p>
<p>If we want to spread the word on this, it is incumbent upon us believers to get out there and spread the word in the comment sections.  Link them to the best, most recent compendiums, not Reddit - too much for sheeple's brains.  Use stuff with lots of imagery.  They get pictures.</p>
<p>Again, OPSEC is highly recommended - do not use your regular emails, user IDs, log-in methods, Disqus accounts, etc.</p>
<p>Here's a few places to start spreading the word:</p>

        <p><p>A good collection of memes would be helpful.</p>
<p>Anyone know how I might go about making some?</p></p>

        <p><p>"Memes" Would everybody settle down on calling these memes?  They're collages/compilations of data.  NOT MEMES</p>
<p>Memes are those image macros that usually have some terrible pun in it</p></p>
