        <p><p>Abramovic is a famous artist, this doesn't mean she couldn't be part of this all, but it definitely doesn't mean everybody she comes in contact with is also connected to pizza.</p></p>

        <p><p>De Niro is also in a lotta art circles. His father was an artist in NYC. Doesn't feel like DeNiro is involved in any way with pedos. </p></p>

        <p><p>IMO, he's just susceptible to the left' painting of Trump. Just like Sanders. But DeNiro is more of an alpha so he didn't hold back. </p></p>

        <p><p>Exactly.  That is what I thought by makes a lot of sense, given the huge pedophilia problem Hollywood.  Everything seems to be connected and Hollywood could be connected to it.  One of the reasons most of Hollywood was so outspoken for Hillary.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah I know. He's standing next to the women who is connected to the pedophile elite. Meaning he has a 2nd degree connection to the pedos. Not too much of a stretch to think he possibly does disgusting things with those people.</p></p>

        <p><p>So it makes sense that De Niro is connected to this because he's an ardent Trump-hater?</p>
<p>I don't follow this train of thought at all. It isn't clear.

        <p><ol>
<li>He suddenly becomes unreasonably desperate all of the sudden about Trump not being elected</li>
<li>Right after that, the pizza info and spirit cooking info are released</li>
<li>It is appears podesta and Abramovic have ties to each other as well as ties to the pizza places.</li>
<li>De Niro has ties to Podesta and Abramovic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Put all of that together, and it is WORTHY OF LOOKING INTO FURTHER. Nobody is saying it proves anything yet, just that it is worthy of digging deeper. Good detectives follow leads like this. Bad ones dismiss them.</p></p>
