        <strong>Australian Ping Pong tournament that benefits human trafficking</strong>
        <p><p>This may not be anything and they may be legit, but let's remember that there are circles within circles...</p>
<p>From their about page on Facebook:
"While our focus in 2016 remains engaging boys and men as event participants (because men are at the heart of the problem of trafficking/exploitation yet are largely absent when it comes to being part of the solution), girls and women who want to get their Pong On, can participate at most venues."</p>

<p>The main page of their Facebook page states:
"24hrs of TABLE TENNIS fun...
Venues all over Australia...
Take up your paddles...
Help end the exploitation and trafficking of young people..."</p>

        <p><p>There is definitely the spiral logo there on the guy. I will see what i can dig up on this. Looks to be some sort of anti human trafficking org but that is what they call hiding in plain sight!</p>
<p>Since i live in Australia, i am happy to go and investigate any places like comet ping pong down here.</p>
<p>No guns here so no fear. We do have pedos running the place in Australia just like you folks in the US.</p></p>

        <p><p>Sonshine FM plays religious music, specifies evangelical, which makes me think of The Family International because they are a global Evangelical organization that many suspect is a pedophile ring. http://streema.com/radios/98_Five_Sonshine_6SON</p>
<p>Here's their Facebook page and you can see that their slogan is "We're family." https://www.facebook.com/98five/</p></p>
