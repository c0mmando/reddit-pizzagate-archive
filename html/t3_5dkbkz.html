        <strong>Could this be a "let them eat cake" moment?</strong>
        <p><p>Just dropping this out there - 
Based on the small amount I've looked at this, I'd say there is something going on. Probably involves ALOT of officials regardless of party. </p>
<p>It also looks like media/govt are losing control of the narrative here - this is probably why the whole "alt-right" fake news thing is being pushed - to keep people from looking into this.
Even so, it looks to be gaining more and more awareness.</p>
<p>So my thought is at a certain point this idea will reach critical mass with the "common" man - he hears about it from Bob (bob's crazy) then he hears it from Joe (hmm maybe both are crazy) then Jim, then Tony (huh something may actually be going on!)</p>
<p>We had a lot of angry voters who have been pissed for quite awhile. So much so that they ignored the "Trump is racist" narrative, said screw it, at least he will "burn it down".</p>
<p>Now imagine this hits critical mass, and they try to bury it.
At that point this could very well become America's "let them eat cake" moment.</p>
<p>I am not advocating violence, merely saying that this issue above all others could be the match for work stoppages, tax protests or worst of all a second american revolution.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p></p>

        <p><p>Yep. And part of the problem is that most of what we have is against democrats because we are working off of Podesta's emails. So right now this looks like an alt-right witchhunt, and it could get really divisive and ugly if we can actually bring them down. Trump will soon be in the White House. Congress is majority Republican. The mainstream media is mostly liberal. We have almost exclusively democratic suspects right now. This could get really bad, but I don't give a shit. Children need to be protected, and fuck everything else.</p></p>

        <p><p>This has, from the beginning struck me as a do or die situation. Either they go down or we do. And what i mean be we is the people of the whole world, because this stuff isn't just in the US, its global.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm advocating for a global awakening of the true power of man, intelligence, and collective consciousness. We have the power to stop evil, but we are letting them get away with it. </p>
<p>We must hold the elites accountable. We the people. </p></p>
