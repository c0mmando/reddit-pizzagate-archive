WELL LOOK AT THE PIC FROM OWNER OF COMET PIZZA'S INSTAGRAM TALKING ABOUT DR PONG IN GERMANY</strong>

        <p><p>Review of Drpong from tripadvisor : </p>
<p>My friend and I visited Dr Pong after he saw that it was ranked number 2 of bar/clubs in Berlin and he thought if sounded 'cool'. He did no further research (not even reading the reviews on Tripadvisor or looking at the photos). I didn't either...</p>
<p>If an overpriced gimmick bar in Berlin is what you're after, then Dr Pong is your place. It features;
•one ping pong table 
•one fusball table (broken)
•expensive drinks, served in plastic cups 
•20 something American staff who probably think that East Berlin 'is über radical, Bowie was here and everything' 
•exposed electrical cables and outlets 
•'authentic' disgusting toilets 
•hipsters a-plenty </p>
<p>It sucked.</p>
<p>But then again, I didn't read the reviews, so it's partly my fault. Also, I'm sure there's plenty who will say that it is really authentic and cool and brag to their friends back home that they saw the 'real Berlin' because 'I'm not a tourist - I'm a traveller'.</p></p>

        <p><p>And "Linken" has an image of a hotdog, "Bilder" has an image of a baby, and "Angebot" (the menu page) has an image of a kid (reading the menu). Just another sketchy ping pong-related overly children-friendly place for adults. Nothing to see here. Move along.</p>
<p>On the "Angebot" page (the menu page) there's a section at the bottom called "tuschetennis zugehör", which means "table tennis acessories", followed by "Andro S**kind", which could mean "androginous (sex) child". Then the description says "Sticky as a long, slow summertime fuck - 10 euros".</p>
<p>Perfectly normal stuff.</p></p>

It was mentioned on Ping Ping as well under Table Tennis Accessories. </p>
<p>Andro does not sell Ping Pong accessories with that name, and never has.</p></p>

<p>Anyone have any experience with German that could translate the audio when you first load the site?</p></p>

        <p><p>The good and plenty site also has a youtube channel linked.  It's especially bizarre because it is about image compression technology:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zdqsp0zbtk
 Why is he wearing a costume?  It could be just a joke but he has several videos discussing image compression.  There's also a video about tying someones feet to cinderblocks and throwing them off a bridge....  This doesn't add up</p></p>

        <p><p>One of the 50 most powerful people. Here is the description from the list. I'll include 48 and 50 as well as I think they provide odd contrast. Playing devil's advocate, I do think it's possible that they could only come up with 48 powerful people and decided to just do basically a native ad for the last two. As 48 seems to have actual power. But you can't deny that last line of 50 is odd knowing what we know now about James. </p>
<p><strong>48. Jack Quinn</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Democratic <strong>megalobbyist</strong> represents juggernaut clients like ATT and AARP. He also sits on the board of the defense firm formerly known as Blackwater, making sure they hold on to those hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of security contracts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>49. James Alefantis</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Liberal twentysomethings in khakis drink beer and eat pizza at Alefantis-owned Comet Ping Pong. More established progressives wine and dine next door at Alefantis-owned Buck's Fishing Camping. Alefantis is also the board president of Transformer, the contemporary art gallery that shamed the Smithsonian for removing an installation offensive to right-wingers. When it comes to D.C. radical chic, Alefantis is unsurpassed. If you don't know him, you aren't wearing your scarf right.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>50. Bradley Graham Lissa Muscatine</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The former Washington Post reporter and his wife, a former Hillary Clinton speechwriter, prevailed last year in a furious bidding war for liberal Washington's most sacred space. Since taking over the bookstore, the couple has upped its profile, hosting readings and events featuring wonky celebs like Jeffrey Sachs, Thomas Friedman, and Michael Moore. As Franklin Foer, former editor of The New Republic, who also made a bid for the bookstore puts it: <strong>"It's essentially the big church for elite Washington."</strong> <em>Pagans.</em></p>

<p>There's still no hard evidence, but why does everything related to Comet end up being so strange and out of place??  </p></p>

        <p><p>Look at the hidden english on the 5th tab </p>
<p>"TABLE TENNIS AS A MODEL: 
For conversation, participation, and lesser-mitigated happiness. Interests and themes that motivate our starting are: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Un-virtuality (physicality) / real variability. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Healthy addiction. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Losing defintion between game/sport and �partying�. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gaining control / losing control. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pre-apocalyptic activity. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvement of eye-hand coordination. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>�feedback play�. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>OTHER GAMES: 
It is intended that the game space has the possibility to itself be played, through the use of mobilized furniture, perpetually changing d�cor, installations, exhibitions, etc. It is thought that there is an appeal to walking in to a room in which one expects to be surprised. For example, the room may be rearranged as necessary in order to suit momentarily changing needs, as in a gymnasium in which sports equipment is moved and exchanged depending upon the activity at hand. </p>
<p>LOW RESOLUTION: 
The organization of the organization, as well as its space, are therefore intended to be less than comprehensively organized. It should be clear what makes up the association and its activities, but less definable in what it produces in the way of a specific atmospheric quality or public image. We, like the public at large, might at times wonder what exactly we�re dealing with here, and never know."</p></p>

        <p><p>Yup, scary stuff, I think there are tons of these websites lying around, pretty sure this one's a front as well http://lesliecashen.com/www.lesliecashen.com/flowers.html, someone had found that through Comet Ping Pong. Also has children and pricing, it's definitely not a photography website I can tell you that.</p></p>

        <p><p>Why deleted and why being downvoted?  For me I find something very suspicious about the last paragraph, "low resolution".  The wording is very strange, and the site itself links to 'goodandplenty' (http://www.goodandplenty.de/), which claims to be a DJ service that can be accessed remotely over the internet.  Umm, what?
Then they have a youtube channel describing LOW RESOLUTION image compression:</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zdqsp0zbtk</p>
<p>Here is a creepy ass demonstration of the technology, I guess (i recommend no sound):</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aob78Y3Tb1Y</p>
<p>Why is a pizza place related to a remote access DJ service (who ever heard of such a thing?)?  Why do the DJs have videos discussing low resolution, which is referenced on the Dr. Pong sight.  </p>
<p>Perhaps the pizza place employees just happen to be into that kind of thing and I am stretching it, but it is all very coincidental to a fault.</p></p>

        <p><p>This picture is made of the backgroundpicture of the website. I would easy be able to reproduce that in photoshop. Probably just invert the colors, erase some text. Every symbol you see in tgat pic exists on the page.</p>
<p>Why is only one picture around, if they hacked it? Thats a small prey...</p>
<p>Strong guess its just a nice troll. Looks creepy of course. </p></p>

        <p><p>That is fair but that is also an extremely elaborate troll.  Reading the text on a instagram pic, going to said website, then producing false image with whats on the site.  And the site just HAPPENS to be incidentally creepy?  </p>
<p>It also doesn't really address the bizarre context.  Why the flying fuck would Comet decide to randomly plug this restaurant?  I suppose he might be the owner in some way, which is also why it is ping pong related as well, but that in itself is curious.  Why own a weird restaurant all the way on the other side of the world?</p></p>

        <p><p>He's likely been there enough to know its owner. There's an old Tumblr account with pictures from 2012 in which there are both pictures of Comet-related things <em>and</em> both inside and outside Dr. Pong.</p>
<p>The owner of Dr. Pong <em>seems</em> to be interested in actual Ping Pong, though, see "Uberpong tournament."</p>
<p>Gonna dig it up, it's in one of the old EWO threads and I forgot to back it up...</p></p>
