        <strong>Open Society Foundations (Soros) gave a grant to a registered sex offender to advocate for rights of sex offenders!</strong>
        <p><p>I posted this in another thread on The_Donald and it got some attention but never made it to the top.  I thought I would repost here to see if it helps anyone. 
Original Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5cglb5/open_society_foundations_soros_gave_a_grant_to_a/</p>
<p><strong>IF ANYTHING IT AT LEAST ASSOCIATES OSF/SOROS WITH A REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER WHO HAS NOW BEEN ARRESTED FOR VIOLATING PROBATION BY TEXTING A 16 YEAR OLD!!</strong>
I was following the lead on Open Society Foundations' connection to riots and I was trying to find the same links as another user just by searching and tripped and fell into a rabbit hole. I went to the individual grantees page on open society foundation's website and randomly saw that a grant was given to Galen Baughman who will:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>work to end the indefinite detention of young people in Virginia who are branded by the state as irredeemably dangerous "sexually violent predators."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/about/programs/us-programs/grantees/galen-baughman
http://archive.is/xmVOo</p>
<p>A little background on Galen Baughman shows that he spent 9 years in prison for "consensual sex" with a 14 yo when he was 19. 
EDIT: u/FullMetalSquirrel found more on these charges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically, Baughman was full go shit, conned Gavin and others by selling his pedophilia as normal homosexual behavior penalized due to homophobia. However, he had three charges prior to the one he went around talking about and they were definitely not all consensual - one victim was 9 years old. I can't find the link where Gavin talked about what really happened but you will find this: A Virginia newspaper reported that he was separately arrested on suspicion of having sexual contact with juveniles in Arlington, Virginia. In the end, Baughman was convicted of charges involving three victims: carnal knowledge of a minor, promoting sexual performance by a child, and aggravated sexual battery. (The last of these was related to an incident involving a 9-year-old that took place when Baughman was 14.) in this article: http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2016/04/galen_baughman_seemed_like_an_ideal_spokesman_for_sex_offenders_civil_rights.html </p>
</blockquote>
<p>After his release he is now an activist for sex offenders' rights. Well, earlier this year he was arrested again for inappropriately texting a 16 yo boy. Guess things don't change..</p>

<p>Now, why would Soros be giving grants to registered sex offenders to be advocating for rights of sex offenders? I followed up by checking out his twitter and ~~couldn't find much of interest~~, but he quit posting in April shortly before his arrest.  EDIT: just found that he <a href="https://twitter.com/ENBrown/status/720294769256042496">retweeted</a> some article about a sex ring (http://archive.is/P6Xp0)!! Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/GalenBaughman?lang=en">@GalenBaughman</a>
 http://archive.is/vGV37</p>
<p>I feel like there has to be more connecting him to Soros, at least through a third party. 
Also as a sick sidenote, he apparently gave a TED talk about "We're all sex offenders" according to this article:</p>
<p>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3570013/Spokesman-sex-offenders-rights-claimed-sex-offenders-TEDx-talk-arrested-texting-16-year-old-boy.html
http://archive.is/xMf5v</p>
<p>I'm trying to find the TED talk.  EDIT: link on youtube seems to be private.</p>
<p>Nothing came up in my podesta WikiLeaks search but I am hoping other autists can help me find some connections.</p>
<p>EDIT: u/CamelToad041 found that another Soros Justice Fellow was given a grant for reforming sex offender laws in California.  Her name is <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/about/programs/us-programs/grantees/eliza-hersh">Eliza Hersh</a>. 
http://archive.is/0xzwW</p>
<p>EDIT: u/CamelToad041 found that these types of "sex offender" grants have been given out since 1997. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>2016: Eliza Hersh 2015: Galen Baughman, <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/about/programs/us-programs/grantees/judith-levine-and-erica-meiners">Judith Levine</a>, Erica Meiners, <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/about/programs/us-programs/grantees/nuri-nusrat">Nuri nusrat</a> 2013: <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/multimedia/introducing-2013-soros-justice-fellows">Joshua Gravens</a> 2012: <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/multimedia/introducing-2012-soros-justice-fellows">Dana Wolfe</a> and I'm sure many more, as these grants stem back to ~1997. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>OH SHIT: 2015 Fellow Judith Levine wrote a book called <a href="http://archive.is/6uOwK">Harmful to Minors</a> which according to wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lambastes United States laws concerning child pornography, statutory rape, and abortion for minors</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cover is fucking creepy as well.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  The foreward in that book was written by <strong>Joycelyn Elders</strong>, Surgeon general fired by Clinton in 1994 for her statements on drugs and masturbation. Well Elders and Soros both sit on the board of directors and honorary board for <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/staff-and-board/board-directors">Drug Policy Alliance</a> (http://archive.is/42A60)  I don't know what to make of that, but there is a connection!</p>
<p>I found Levine's name in a podesta email: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3094
highlighted it. Looks like it may be just a subscription to Center for Genetics and Society mailing list, but still weird.</p></p>

        <p><p>Disgusting. These globalists really wants to create a one world where anyone can do any immoral act they want without any consequences... as long as they give them all their rights. </p></p>

        <p><p>I found Soros just now too.... I was going through the businesses next to Comet Ping Pong and I found that there is/was an international children's organization called
<strong>Children's Resources International</strong>
https://www.yelp.com/biz/childrens-resources-international-washington
The only place that I could find any information on them was:
http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Children%27s_Resources_International
<strong>Come to find out, their listed website is down...</strong>
http://www.childrensresources.org/
At least for me, I'm in Europe. Anyway, I couldn't find anything other than they operate in a lot of countries, and then I found a name that I never want to run into...</p>
<p>The page is in Romanian, but the first text with substance says Children's Resources International is working with Open Society Institute... which is owned and run by none other than <strong>George Soros</strong>
https://www.unicef.org/romania/ro/introducere.pdf</p>
<p>Other posts mentioning he had some $11k connection/donation to/at Comet Ping Pong as well.</p>
<p>EDIT: Soros organization also has the Spiral logo.
