        <strong>IMO memes are one of the most effective way to reach people quickly. They are familiar to people and easy to process and can reach a lot of people quickly. In this album are a few memes I made that can help spark some peoples interest, please spread them or create your own if you have can!</strong>

        <p><p>The reason memes are a useful way to spread information quickly is because they tie a single common pop culture reference to an idea.
I think PizzaGate will require new memes to be impactful, as the tone of these acts shouldn't be taken so lightly.
Good effort, keep working!</p></p>

        <p><p>I thought about it some more and I removed one that I thought wasn't really appropriate. (Save ALL the children) but I think there is a line that you can tread where it is obvious you are speaking about a serious subject through a less serious format. </p>
<p>I think new memes can help as well but I feel like the good thing about the old ones is that people have this weird relationship with memes. Almost like they trust them a little bit because they are used to seeing them mostly when they've become popular enough to reach them. When that happens their content usually have to be pretty clever.  I'm not saying that effect has any crucial significance but I believe it helps them along a little bit. I didn't spend any real time on this but I thought it would be good to get more people active in doing this kind of stuff.</p></p>

        <p><p>Nice work! </p>
<p>Something else I'd like to add for those reading who want to make <strong>youtube videos</strong>:</p>
<p>Keep the pace FAST. Go really fast. Talk really fast. People these days are ADD, and a slow video with slow speech and slow moving pictures will only make people stop watching after about 10 seconds. </p>
<p>The three minute video in the sidebar is good because it has little bits of humor, such as the narrator saying "creeepyy!!". You get the idea. </p>
<p>So anyway, fast pace, lots of pictures, entertaining narration, and of course facts only. Emails/Haiti/comet ping pong focused. If you delve too much into occult stuff, you'll lose them. </p></p>

        <p><p>I would also add good sources in the description and mention it in the video. The more critical would dismiss it if there weren't any sources.</p></p>

        <p><p>Not obnoxiously fast, but fast enough to keep your attention. This video about reddit comes to mind https://youtu.be/tlI022aUWQQ</p>
<p>If there's concern about being able to verify the facts, they could always pause and look it up. Just my opinion :)</p></p>

        <p><p>I would say that for the most part I don't think meme's appropriately convey the serious of the situation. </p>
<p>Many of these are difficult to take serious and could reflect in a negative way to someone just dipping their toes in.</p></p>

        <p><p>Use some modern memes. Those are a "little" out of date.
Maybe look over to SilvaGunner. Or Youtubehaiku.</p>
<p>Also don't be so upfront, instead use the word pizza everywhere out of context so people get interested and google it.</p>
<p>Just a little #pizzagate into the corner.</p>
<p>Also a tactic can be to involve subgroups that could raise the flags;
BLM memes, liberal memes, altright memes, feminist memes, redpill memes... so on. Need to target audiences.</p>
<p>Edit: People in this thread are already masters, hehe.</p></p>
