        <strong>Oliver Willis at Media Matters just published a story on Comet Pizza pushing the fake angle. Remember Media Matters is owned by David Brock who dated the owner of Comet Pizza. David Brock also runs Correct the Record. (Link to archived version)</strong>

<p>If there really is nothing then do your job by thoroughly debunking all the evidence and leads we gathered. Pick up the phone, call in some favors, hire a dozen private eyes. You know, what people used to pay the newspapers for... </p></p>

        <p><p>So true. One shill writes a hit piece, the rest point to that hit piece as evidence. Hopefully people come here themselves so they can see what info Kang and the NYT lied about/didn't include. </p></p>

        <p><p>Notice the article doesn't mention the close connections between Media Matters and the subject of their story. It seems like mentioning your boss dated the individual at the center of your story would be a very obvious thing to mention to readers to avoid accusations of conflict of interest. </p>
<p>http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/02/27/media-matters-boss-paid-former-partner-850g-blackmail-settlement.html</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brock’s bitter legal battle with Grey, who is described in a Sept. 14, 2010, police report obtained by FoxNews.com as his domestic partner of more than 10 years, began after Brock began dating Washington, D.C., restaurant impresario <strong>James Alefantis</strong> about five years ago. For the next three years, Brock and Grey traded angry accusations, which were documented in the police report and were the foundation of a pitched legal battle replete with charges of blackmail, theft and financial malfeasance.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>http://nymag.com/news/media/david-brock-media-matters-2011-5/index1.html</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the effort he once spent cultivating his public reputation has been channeled into cultivating Media Matters’. “I’m an incredibly hard worker, I’m incredibly tenacious, and I’m incredibly detail-oriented,” Brock explains. He often plans his vacations with his boyfriend, <strong>James Alefantis</strong>, around visits to wealthy liberals who might donate to the organization. And whereas he used to think of himself as a conservative action hero—“I kill liberals for a living,” he once declared—he now reaches for a more mundane analogy to describe his role on the left. “I’m kind of a builder of institutions,” he says. “I think I’ve got some ability to look at what’s out here, look at a playing field, and identify gaps and niches.”</p>

<p>another Redditor mentioned that #pizzagate sounds not serious, but I think its interesting enough to turn heads if we add a serious-sounding teaser catchphrase and just let that lead into the hashtag. The stickers should really strike people, if they are going to work.</p></p>

        <p><p>I believe that the figure used in the JimmyCommet picture is related to pedophila. Its a rendition of a boy that loved a man. There was one post on here that made the connection and had pictures. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, that's correct. The first "news story" to break on this, "real" or "fake" was first on Daily Mail UK, and next the NYT article. More are following, citing the NYT original. (misinformation)</p>
<p>All the articles were published weeks after the election, and from what I can understand, a week AFTER people began speculating #pizzagate from the Podesta-emails/FB/instagram posts they were sifting through on 4chan, 8chan first, then Reddit The Donald, and then here. There was NO MEDIA COVERAGE at all on this when the author of the NYT article claims there was a "fake news article published" that is a straight up lie.</p></p>

        <p><p>There were fake news stories about other topics but none concerning this story. The left wing media has been pushing the fake news thing for a few days to explain why Clinton lost. They are now trying to connect this story to that for a short cut to delegitimize it. They are repeating fake news as a buzzword for people who are only casually interested to absorb. </p></p>

        <p><p>I don't think it's unusual for the parents of the children not to want to draw more attention to themselves. Most sexual abuse of children stems from family friends and associates. For all we know the parents just thought the guy posting pictures of their children was harmless hipster fun or were perhaps ignorant of it all together. We don't know what is happening behind the scenes. If something is going on the parents might be completely in the dark. </p></p>

        <p><p>you assume the children have traditional parents. in their dark evil world those kids might have been on loan. remember the "1 hour pizza"?</p></p>

        <p><p>I think your kind of speculation doesn't help. If you have evidence of the parents involvement directly post it but the parents are not necessarily aware of any of this. </p></p>

        <p><p>I see it. Only netted one up vote (sad). I am not sure if my link looks differently for others. I just posted it because I thought it would ring true for people first learning that they need to see the big picture of what is happening with MSM/social media reporting/filtering and the shills that are on these boards.</p></p>

        <p><p>How weak. If anyone reading that article for the first time hadn't heard a thing about pizzagate sure they would laugh it off. "one message said 'i will kill you personally' " --&gt; doubtful. where's the screenshot? </p>
<p>No mentions of the owner having disturbing photos on his IG or the other evidence we have discussed in this sub. What's truly fucking terrifying is people will see "oh the New York Times said it was fake so it's fake." and go about their day not a second thought wasted on it. This is the kind of shit made for people like my brother. When I showed him this sub he basically went, "oh Reddit? just like the boston bomber" and dismissed everything before I could even show him any pictures/articles/evidence. </p>
<p>"Well if the NYT said so, surely they can't be lying because they wouldn't lie to us."  -- like, why are people so afraid to question things? Whelp this article said, "totally fake" so it is. WHELP this article also didn't tell us why they have so much disturbing art and sexually charged pictures at a "kid-friendly" pizza place where the owner has no children. So many people just laughing this off and I'm genuinely curious why that is. Wouldn't you rather be "wrong" than quiet about people hurting children? </p></p>

<p>I don't think most people who get into journalism these days do it because of a deep desire to seek truth. </p></p>

        <p><p>Great question but totally unanswered to this date. The people posting these images are not the parents of these kids...and this NYT "reporter" either did not bother to look into this...or more likely did not even know to look into it because he explored absolutely none of the evidence.</p></p>
