        <p><p>So Stratfor is basically the CIA without FOAs, has anyone looked through their emails on wikileaks?</p></p>

        <p><p>I've been going through them, there are a lot of spam about pizza, from a restaurant named Austin's pizza. It's seemingly innocent, but could be being used to mask the real emails. There are A LOT of pizza spam. I did find some interesting emails containing lists of Addresses and contact info, Called "ball of wax" I'm wary of linking them because of reddits TOS. But on all these "ball of wax" lists there is an entry for an "Anthony Podesta", with an email at "bluewin.ch", and a street address in Switzerland. Could use some help digging, just search the StratFor emails for ball of wax or BOW and check the .csv attachments</p>
<p>EDIT: Ball of wax idiom: http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/whole+ball+of+wax</p>
<p>So my thinking is that this is absolutely a list of an organization or conspiracy, and one that includes and Anthony Podesta is certainly worth looking into. There are so many Stratfor emails, I'm going to need help going through them.</p></p>
