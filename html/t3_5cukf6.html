        <strong>This Sub is Compromised</strong>
        <p><p>The Top Post page doesn't include a single post older than 24 hours.</p>
<p>The Top Post has 1200 upvotes and is only 8 hours old, which doubles the upvotes of the runner up.</p>
<p>Shills are shitposting at a cyclic rate to discredit the true investigation.</p></p>

        <p><p>True, but there is undeniably an element of disinfo, and shitposting going on intentionally as well.  Mix that with the people that are just naive and we have the bullshit we are seeing now.  </p></p>

        <p><p>I'm one of the mods and while you can choose to not believe me, I don't think anyone on the team is interested in doing anything beyond helping further this case. We are all pretty well in alignment with the goals of this sub I think.</p>
<p>If there are any specific concerns that people would like to have addressed, please feel free to post it here or send a message directly to the team.</p>
<p>As far as the 1200 upvotes vs 8 hours old, since yesterday, we've gained over 2000 new subscribers. Quite easy to understand how that can be organic.</p></p>

        <p><p>If it is clearly trolling of any kind, feel free to report it and downvote.</p>
<p>Of course, the best action to take with trolls is simply to ignore them.</p></p>

        <p><p>For sure, but more specifically all the threads and comments trying to curate what people look into.  That's got to stop, no?  Post a lead, if users care to investigate they can, and whatever comes to light comes to light.  If it's nothing, we can move forward.  Too many shillish threads and comments telling people what to look into and what not to look into.</p></p>

        <p><p>The problem is this. When someone posts a possible lead and some dummy jumps in and says, "This means nothing, let's look over here," that poster can't help but feel it's CTR or a concern troll.</p>
<p>All leads need to be investigated. We need a team of known pedes that have been on this since day 1. A group of core guys are KNOWN not to be CTR, is an expert navigator, can go ghost, etc. THEY should be validating/discrediting leads because they are at the forefront. All credited leads should be posted in a sticky until the lead ends. All discredited leads can be listed in a secondary sticky for less nimble pedes to dig through?</p>
<p>The problem is discrediting a possible lead. Everyone knows that a good detective follows ALL leads. We have a force large enough that "pay grades" need to be established and workloads need to be delegated to we CAN follow all leads.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yep.  When the shills ask for sources, tell them to read.  It's not fucking hard.  The whole fucking idea of this sub is to pursue leads and cross things off the list that we know not to be true.  A lot of "how can I find real proof" bullshit going down right now.  People that ask that question can fuck off.  You can use your own eyes and brain and draw your own conclusions if you are so desperate for something that convinces you</p></p>
