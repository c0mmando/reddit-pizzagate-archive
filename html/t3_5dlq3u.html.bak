        <strong>Getting kind of scared</strong>
        <p><p>Hey guys I'm not sure if this is allowed here, if not I'm sorry but this is the only place I could think of to post it. I'm getting pretty scared for my safety now. That woman in Haiti ended up dead investigating the same thing and I'm just worried I'm on their list somehow. I'm not as in deep as some people are and I'm not in America so that should hopefully mean something. Basically what I'm asking is how likely is it that someone like me will be "suicided"? I'm no deeper than the comet ping pong stuff (I'm not sure what's been discovered that runs deeper than that) and I'm working on an article to summarize and basically explain the Pizzagate scandal to help raise awareness of it.</p></p>

        <p><p>There are millions of people who know about this, videos with hundreds of thousands views each, radio hosts talking about it, state media in other countries referencing it, social media around the world abuzz... You're fine, as long as you're not in their network already, which I doubt.</p>
<p>Edit: That said, protect your anonymity, and beware that it is very muchso the case that people have been suicided before for looking into this. Even as little as a few weeks ago, this was true. The logistics of such a coverup now seem pretty impossible, so if they're suiciding anyone, it's people who already know something that they shouldn't.</p></p>

        <p><p>I get spooked pretty much every other day, reaching a new level of WTF looking into this. Especially when I run across something particularly dark unexpectedly. It's ok.. I think it's because we're human. This is some of the most evil material on the planet. If that didn't make us feel like vomiting or afraid, then we'd be sociopaths. </p></p>

        <p><p>Consider this, the people being "suicided" are the big shots who go out publicly about their investigations, connections or who travels to these places of interest.</p>
<p>Stay anonymous and if you decide to go to the places where it happened to investigate, go armed, conceal carry or anything else you can. ( Within the law of course even if criminals don't care about the law. )</p>
<p>They obviously keep surveilance on places of interest and people who might know too much so that they know if anyone gets too close to the truth. Remember that even if they have governments in their pockets they still want to keep the "suicides" to the minimum.</p>
<p>Also remember this "conspiracy theory" has existed for years and people have been "suicided" over the years without it getting any traction with the common people investigating it.</p>
<p>So them keeping the "suicides" to the minimum has worked out so far, but the bodies are starting to pile up and they're most likely cleaning evidence now so that they won't have to perform more "suicides" on people who found out too much.</p></p>

        <p><p>I saw a thread yesterday with advice from a lawyer on how to begin safely stockpiling hard copies of evidence off of the cloud and timestamped and so-on but I'm struggling to locate it now (new to reddit, brought here by pizzagate). As others have said, with the amount of traffic, you probably have no reason to fear being suicided. But moving forward with evidence collection continue to protect your anonymity and somehow document that you are researching this to find incriminating evidence, otherwise it may look like you are a pedo looking for like minded folks. Also, be wary of cyber warfare. I'd argue that more likely than you being suicided is you clicking a weaponized link that quietly downloads kiddie porn so that you can be later accused of merely projecting if you begin to make too much noise. </p>
<p>If someone can find and link the thread I mentioned with the lawyer's take, it may be worth the read. I found it comforting (as comforting as one can, considering the nature of what we are investigating).</p>

<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dhymw/listen_up_detectives_this_post_contains_info_that/?ref=search_posts</p>
<p>Edit: Found link, included above. The post mentions some specific closed-source diary program with timestamps that would supposedly be defensible in court yada, yada... I can't say anything good or bad about the program because I'm unfamiliar, but obviously don't put all your eggs in one basket - especially one given to you by a stranger on the intetnet (even me).</p></p>

        <p><p>The people they are suiciding are the ones who find out what the masses (us) are not aware of. It's like stomping out the little fires so they don't spread. they only bother when it's isolated info. Which is why we need to spread knowledge as much as possible. It keeps us all safer. </p></p>
