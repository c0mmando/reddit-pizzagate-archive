        <strong>Anybody else getting strange calls/emails since digging into pizzagate?</strong>
        <p><p>So just to start off I was digging into the Monica Petersen the other day and after posting some information on it I got back to back phone calls from a local # that I wasn't familiar with, picked it up and someone was on the other end breathing but not responding to my hellos and then eventually hung up. I tried doing a reverse lookup on the # and couldn't find any relevant information, now I get a single strange email every day since then, they appear to be spam but they're going directly to my inbox which has never happened to me before. The first was one telling me Amazon had a surprise for me and had some weird URL to click, I reached out to Amazon just to make sure it wasn't a legitimate email and they said it was a phishing attempt which I already assumed. Now this morning I was up and I have an email with the heading "ProtectYourChildrenKidsLiveSafe". The contents of the email are a strange ad warning of a neighborhood safety alert and that there could be child predators in my area.</p>
<p>I'm not one to be overly paranoid about things like this, it's just that the timing of everything seems very strange to me so I'd figure I would see if anyone else was having coincidences like this?</p></p>

        <p><p>I've also been having some issues but I can't attribute it to the investigation as my net always has some hiccups though it has been more frequent as of late. The emails just strike me as super strange, especially the one I received this morning, I don't like it at all.</p></p>

        <p><p>yeah definitely not, I'm keeping them around for now though just in case I guess, I'm not the tin foil hat wearing type however the timing feels too coincidental to me.</p></p>

        <p><p>Lock your doors and windows and take care of your family. If you get another phone call then maybe call the police. It doesn't seem like a coincidence that someone called your house (some people do this before robberies to see when/if anyone is home) and the fact that you almost got phished the next day also sounds alarming.</p></p>

        <p><p>That sounds pretty normal actually. Way before pizzagate, I'd get bullshit calls all the time. Yeah, is creepy when they don't say anything but it doesn't mean too much.</p>
<p>Could be a connection issue, someone who realized they called the wrong number, an automated dialing system that's glitching... If they want to shut you down crank calls are not going to be the avenue they take. You're right to be suspicious becuase we are dealing with heavy shit here. But it is international children's day, could explain the timing of that email. Spam and junk mail is nothing new!</p>
<p>Like I said, you're right to be cautious and alert but there are perfectly reasonable explanations for these things as well. Don't feel intimidated! The good guys always win in the end.</p></p>

        <p><p>I too got a strange phonecall from someone in "Whitehouse Oh" (about 3 hours away from where I live). I didn't answer, but called back later out of curiosity, and the number had been disconnected. Could just be coincidence, weird that others have had the same happen to them.</p></p>
