        <strong>Anonymous IRC.</strong>
        <p><p>I have set up an anonymous IRC over TOR just for discussion, feel free to use it to collaborate or discuss this.</p>
<p>Just be careful, while you are on there, do not trust anyone, you can only access this IRC network over TOR and I give no guarantees at all that it will remain up, if I notice the server is attacked, or broken into, I'll turn it off with no warning. the IRCd running is incredibly simple: https://github.com/jrosdahl/miniircd logging is not enabled, I use this over larger IRCds as the codebase is a bit smaller, less features which makes it harder to find end users, keep in mind as I'm sure this sub is monitored, so will the IRC room. It cannot be avoided.</p>
