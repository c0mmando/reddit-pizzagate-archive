        <p><p>She is the editor newsbud.com. They have covered all these topics and monsters for years.</p>
<p>Ie: http://www.newsbud.com/?s=Hastert</p>
<p>Or Epstein</p>
<p>Or Robert Creamer &amp; wife</p>
<p>Or Clintons</p>
<p>Or every fucking one in high ranks</p>
<p>Also her latest book released is so shocking that I had to stop reading it at the third chapter, this "fictional" character is based on Dennis Hastert and 2 little girls. Also chapter 10 is about him according to her AMA</p>
<p>She had to release this book as "fictional" to avoid all the legal problems she had with previous books. It is based on testimonies by whistleblowers in many agencies</p></p>

        <p><p>And Sibel Edmonds also blew the whistle about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibel_Edmonds#Operation_Gladio_B">GLADIO B</a>. She is very credible because she used to be a translator for the culprits, and has escaped many assassination attempts, and is referred to as the "most gagged person in US history".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Edmonds, "Operation Gladio B" is an FBI codename adopted in 1997 for ongoing relations between US intelligence, the Pentagon, and Al Qaeda. The name refers to the original Operation Gladio, in which US intelligence had established groups stay-behind forces in Europe in preparation for a Soviet invasion. She suggests that the objectives of Gladio B are "projecting U.S. power in the former Soviet sphere of influence to access previously untapped strategic energy and mineral reserves for U.S. and European companies; pushing back Russian and Chinese power; and expanding the scope of lucrative criminal activities, particularly illegal arms and drugs trafficking." Former FBI special agent Dennis Saccher states Edmonds's story "should have been front page news" because it is "a scandal bigger than Watergate".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I highly recommend her interview with Corbett ( here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AARtO88G5Ag">part 1</a> ) if you want to understand "islamic" terror. (See also the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio">Gladio</a>). </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, she started working helping abused children</p>
<p>Then as a FBI translator and got in touch with all kinds of terrorism and corruption craziness (Turkish spy organizations tried to bribe her and her superiors ignored her when she denounced it)</p>
<p>Then formed a coalition of whistleblowers</p>
<p>Then tried to inform the media on high ranking cases of corruption and pedophilia and all big media silenced her</p>
<p>Now she is trying to make a people-funded media organization, please support her</p></p>
