        <p><p>That's where you are wrong. We do care. We care so much that we have a sub dedicated to it. Unfortunately, this is not the place. Sorry.</p>

        <p><p>The moderators of this subreddit do not disagree with the opinion that the current situation with Wikileaks and Julian Assange is very sketchy at best and that this needs to be discussed further. However /r/pizzagate is NOT the place for this discussion.</p>
<p>While this is a conversation I personally am very intrigued by, I feel that this discussion does nothing to further our investigation and I do not want this subreddit flooded with speculative posts about Julian Assange.</p>
<p>We ask that you please use /r/WhereIsAssange/ for these kinds of discussions.</p>
<p>We are keeping this thread open today if you wish to continue this discussion here: https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dz25f/julian_assange_is_dead_or_captured_at_least_15/</p></p>
