<p>So much for "werid asian model dude".  You know more than one person can have the same name, right?</p>
<p>Edit: The "DEEP INTEREST" quote is also wrong.  Here is the actual quote:</p>
<p>"..given President Obama’s <strong>deep involvement with and interest</strong> in Myanmar’s political transition.."</p></p>

        <p><p>On this whole topic i keep seeing people try to say Podesta's emails start right after madeline mccann's disappearance, proving he wiped them (this goes along with the idea that he is one of the police sketches too).  A simple search on wikileaks shows this is false.  Yes there is an email a couple days after but it is NOT the first email.  There are emails from 2006 and even earlier and then no emails after that one for a few months.  it's obviously not every single email but the statements being made about mccann and the timing are false.</p></p>

        <p><p>Heh, I never even realized that.  For anyone questioning it, here is a random example of an email John sent himself in 2006:</p>

        <p><p>Here's a linux one-liner that will download all the emails, even the ones not listed. You can compare afterwards with <a href="https://file.wikileaks.org/file/podesta-emails/Maildir/cur/">the index list on the server</a> to highlight the ones that are not showing. I'll be doing this and I'll make a zip file of all the emails that are "hidden", but you might want to archive them yourself.</p>
<p>Depends on GNU Parallel which is a bitchin' utility you should have anyway.</p>
<pre><code>seq 1 59258 | parallel -j20 wget -F -nc -U Mozilla https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails//get/{}
</code></pre>
<p>Change the -j20 to whatever number of threads you want to run at once. 20 was pretty good on a 2core/8GB RAM Kali VM. 100 would likely crash it.</p>
<p>59258 seems to be the highest numbered email, I found this just using  binary search by hand.</p>
<p>If you're concerned about opsec, install <a href="http://proxychains.sourceforge.net/">proxychains</a>, set it up (/etc/proxychains.conf) to use TOR or some other proxy (encrypted SSH tunnels are good) and preface the "wget" with "proxychains" i.e. "-j20 proxychains wget". Or you can just put the whole system in a VPN.</p>
<p>Edit Note: Files are saved as raw with no extension using the above command. If you need them as .html or .eml, run this in the same directory:</p>
<pre><code>seq 1 59258 | parallel -j50 mv {} {}.html
</code></pre>
<p>or </p>
<pre><code>seq 1 59258 | parallel -j50 mv {} {}.eml
</code></pre>
<p>Edit2: Here's a list of the files I was unable to get from the server, meaning they're ACTUALLY missing:</p>

        <p><p>Took a few days off, work is <em>insane</em> right now, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DNCleaks/comments/5cljkp/work_in_progress_wikileaks_the_missinglosthidden/">I have been working on a full list HERE</a> feel free to copy or do whatever you want with it, I hope to present a COMPLETE list of hidden emails in the next few days, thanks to better combing technique!<br>
My best find was this:<br>
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/57821<br>
But it actually suggests that Hillary was doing her job, the fact it's been totally missed though is huge, and shows what you MIGHT find!</p></p>
