        <strong>(Suggestion) can we get topic labels for posts?</strong>
        <p><p>The tinfoil is never going to leave. We need to accept that. Shit posts will continue. However catagorizing will help focus. I suggest the following catagories: tinfoil (unsubstantiated links and reaching), history (unlinked historical accounts of real events), evidence, leaks, finds (4chan or 8chan finds or "larps" that give away answers), theory, self.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah because tinfoil is not subjective at all</p>
<p>This whole thing would have been considered tinfoil by most users here just a month ago. </p></p>
