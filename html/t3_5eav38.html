        <strong>Take a step back and think. Could it be that the crowdsourcing investigations into pizzagate and twittergate are interfering with ongoing Federal and local investigations.</strong>
        <p><p>We do not know the exact number of "diggers" that are out there diving into all of these investigations going back to Wikileaks and the DNC.  I, by no means am saying stop doing what is being done.  But if this is interfering with lets say, an FBI investigation, a hint from them or any other agency that they are on it would be better for everyone.  This is about saving kids.  Autists can't prosecute.  Just something to think about.  </p></p>

        <p><p>This is assuming the FBI want to expose them this . People are saying that the NSA most already have everything we need. 
seems like the public elite buy power from the level above by committing crimes against humanity, that are then held against them for blackmail.  </p></p>

        <p><p>I think the information from FBIanon and the retweeted Silsby speculation from pre-compromised Wikileaks show that the only chance to get justice on this is if we keep digging, uncover the truth as much as we can, and spread info like wildfire so that the crowds of people demanding justice are too loud to ignore.</p>
<p>ETA: Also the documents released to the FBI vault that lined up with the FBI tweets of FOIA-requested info, tweeted at the specific time on the specific date that FBIanon said it would, point to the idea that the people in three-letter agencies have their hands tied due to corrupt bureaucracy until public outcry is huge enough to force them to do something. </p></p>

<p>Comey let Hillary get away with thousands of felonies (each secret email on her home server = felony).</p>
<p>We became the police.</p>
<p>Whistleblowers are the only hope left.   Wikileaks, etc.</p></p>

        <p><p>All of the earmarks of a pedophile ring are there. If what we have now were to be broadly exposed to the public, there would be widespread outrage. I don't see us as digging at the moment for primarily for evidence for use in a prosecution, I see us digging for evidence that can more directly and clearly present what is happening to the public. Right now, getting broader exposure is crucial.</p></p>

        <p><p>Even a direct statement.  We have to remember, these are private citizens, most of them, with businesses.  If they are diddling kids then fuck them and hang em.  But this underground community has to be careful.  We have due process in this country.  We need to protect that above all else. </p></p>

        <p><p>I've thought that as well. I don't think we would find any hard evidence on the top elites either. They probably won't have pics and video as they are actually performing this and not viewing for their enjoyment. As sick as this is and for how long we hear this has been going on, they are pretty good at covering their tracks and having others take the fall. I still hope we can find something that will bring the whole thing down. </p></p>

        <p><p>Wondered this myself. Comes down to, do we wait and see if they are doing anything and chance that they don't and the rich elite get away with harming more kids? Or, do we try to help/do the work in hopes that we can do enough to get their attention or even bust the case ourselves, but risk harming any investigation the FBI may be involved in.</p>
<p>This world revolves around those who have money, sadly. Money has power, and that money can silence any good eggs in the FBI. </p>
<p>Besides idiots who are harassing the people in question, in the long run I think we are helping more than we are hurting considering otherwise there is a chance nothing will happen and we will just have to start this whole investigation over again in a few years once we realize nothing became of it. And then, we will be asking the same questions. What is the FBI doing, if anything?</p>
<p>Hope that made sense :/</p></p>

        <p><p>The fact is, the evidence we can collect is (practically) all freely available on the internet. If it is not collected while it is still cached, it will be lost forever. The FBI can collect evidence from sources that we do not have. In addition the FBI has 650,000+ emails from Hillary and the gang, that information isn't going to change while we're doing our thing.</p>
<p>I would say, lets not worry over their investigation and be more thorough in ours. In the off-chance that they actually get something done about this, then we'll just likely have more suspects for them to investigate further. As it is very likely they'll not traverse such slim connections as deeply as we are.</p>
<p>In our case, diving extremely deep has yielded some very telling and interesting connections between these people. So with that in-mind I would say what we're doing (if done professionally) can benefit any PD/FBI investigation heavily.</p></p>

        <p><p>I would be amazed if it hasn't in one way or another, but this cat is out of the bag and it's not going back in. The pizza lovers covering their tracks when things go public has probably ended information gathering we didn't know about for example. That's how it goes, though - inaction of some leads to action from others. </p></p>

        <p><p>I've had similar thoughts.  I would hate for that to happen.  I don't think we're going to find something hugely extraordinary because most of it is going to be on stuff we don't have access to. But I think what we're doing is drawing attention to this and possibly allowing for doors to open for investigators to do their job.  Think about regular investigations.  The upper management might restrict resources or prevent their people from investigating because of political pressure, but if the public clambers for it to happen, many will bend the knee and allow their people to investigate in direct opposition to the politicians.     </p></p>

        <p><p>With our digging we are only finding more and more truth. We discovered how twitter hosts tons of CP. We are actually reading and looking through the E-mails Wikileaks published. If anything we are helping out those who actually wanna do good within the FBI. Never stop questioning and never stop digging. Only truth and knowledge  can come out of this which is more than enough for our effort. </p></p>
