        <strong>Anyone that dismisses Pizzagate without investigating should be suspect, this is too important to not investigate. Any parents should want to know more to protect their children.</strong>

        <p><p>Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. The fact is that many people are sheep, and will continue to be. They choose to be ignorant, and that is fine. Investigation isn't for everyone, especially when it delves into heavy shit like trafficking and child porn. Really shouldn't put them at fault for taking the blue pill. The truth is rather traumatizing.</p></p>

        <p><p>To be fair, theres a lot about this to make people think it's a crazy conspiracy theory, including the pizza references. </p>
<p>Add to that the constant shit posts, trolling, extremely reaching links and the likely destabilising efforts from the Clinton, Trump and government agents. </p>
<p>I applaud the efforts of people that are genuinely interested in helping the abused but the destabilising efforts are really leaving this place in tatters. </p></p>

        <p><p>Here's the thing though.</p>
<p>Anyone not dismissing it and then coming here to do a little more research are gonna be bombarded with shitty self posts about theories some tin foil hatter came up with. People hanging off the lies of an anon waiting for his lies to come true and 7 million new sightings of a girl that hasn't been seen for a decade.</p>
<p>I'm still not dismissing it, but then there are a lot of people less patient than me.</p>
<p>If you want to be taken seriously clean the sub up. Get rid of the idiots that have hung on to every conspiracy since JFK and start looking like a group of intelligent people investigating a plausible criminal network instead of looking like a David Icke forum.</p></p>

        <p><p>A lot of people... "people"</p>
<p>I understand that this investigation attracts many of the utter conspiracy nuts [chemtrails/aliens] but they should be closer to the bottom of the pages with downvotes.  I feel like it's a tactic to break apart this subreddit.</p></p>
