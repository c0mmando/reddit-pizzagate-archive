        <strong>HOW CAN I BE OF ASSISTANCE?</strong>
        <p><p>I think I'd be good at helping out. But every time I look at the 4chan layout, my eyes glaze over--I have trouble following the way it is presented on screen, and most of the links I see are archived, anyway. </p>
<p>How does someone actually "Get involved" besides reposting information someone else collected, and deciphered? Although that is important, I'm looking to discover new things, so we can get this to where it needs to be. </p>
<p>Going on wikileaks is fine, but how do I know I am not looking at something 38576939 other people looked at before? </p>
<p>What if I have the BEST idea...EVER...that no one ever thought about...and it gets lost in the other 1000s of best ideas ever? </p>
<p>MODS: Maybe a FAQ section would be helpful for people looking to join the fight. </p></p>

        <p><p>Connecting dots, asking good questions...I also know who these players (and their others) are (from afar) from hating the clintons for 20+ years. Good search engine skills and a memory for certain things. An (up to this point) impeccable BS detector and filter, too. </p>
<p>If I could hack, I would be of real use to you. but I am not good at that stuff, and it's probably too late to learn. </p>
<p>What I am going to do is find THE definitive "collections" and go from there. If this wasn't so controversial, and "untouchable", we could organize better. I bet we are already close to  the answer, except there are 234 groups plus 293746758 freelancers looking at this thing with little organization. </p>
<p>If someone was truly in charge, they could say, "Hey, go look into X..." and maybe 5-6 people could look into X. If they don't find anything, but the guy in charge still thinks there is "there" there, he can ask another small group. </p>
<p>I could look for specific things; long shots. Things someone may not want to research or bother with. </p></p>

        <p><p>I could give you things.</p>
<p>Want one to get started?</p>
<p>Look into Sheila Johnson of BET. Any sort of money to dodgy looking places, or connections to people of power or reputation. Or her family and their ties.</p>
<p>That would help me. </p></p>

        <p><p><em>CEO Of Salamander Hotels: Sheila Johnson</em> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Founder and CEO of Salamander Hotels and Resorts. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vice Chairman of Monumental Sports and Entertainment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Part owner of Washington Wizards, (NBA) Washington Capitals, (NHL) the Washington Mystics (WNBA). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serves on the Executive Committee of the United States Golf Association (USGA) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ms. Johnson is a partner in ProJet Aviation, a comprehensive aviation service company specializing in aviation consulting, aircraft acquisitions, management, and charter services. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is also a partner in Mistral, the makers of fine bath, body, and home products; and in November 2012 launched her own collection of luxury scarves, inspired by her travels around the world and manufactured in Italy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ms. Johnson has long been a powerful influence in the entertainment industry, starting with her work as founding partner of Black Entertainment Television, which she is now ashamed of, apparently. I don’t blame her. She has served as executive producer of four documentary films, and also helped finance the Screen Actors Guild nominated feature film The Butler, directed by Lee Daniels and distributed by Harvey Weinstein. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Served on the Board of Governors of Parsons The New School for Design in New York, and is a member of the Leadership Council at Harvard Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership (CPL). She is also a board member of the ANNIKA Foundation, as well as founder and chair of the Middleburg Film Festival, a celebration of independent film. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From 2006 to 2009, Ms. Johnson served as global ambassador for CARE, a leading humanitarian organization that combats global poverty by empowering women. She also served as a member of Accordia Global Health Foundation’s International Council, rallying support for the foundation’s efforts to overcome the burden of infectious diseases in Africa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ms. Johnson received a Bachelor of Arts in music from the University of Illinois, lives in Middleburg, VA, is married to the Honorable William T. Newman, Jr., and has two children.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>The Significance of the Name Salamander:</em>  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Fire/elemental fire. Sometimes associated with witchcraft “eye of newt”, etc. …</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BUT…The name actually comes from Mr. Bruce Sundlun, a war hero, successful businessman and leading politician. During World War II, while flying his 13th mission as a B-17 bomber pilot, Sundlun's plane crashed over Nazi-occupied Belgium. For months, he evaded capture by crossing into France and Spain. The Maquis, a resistance group that was waging guerilla war against the Germans, recruited Sundlun and gave him the code name "Salamander" after the amphibian that can mythically walk through fire. Johnson kept the name when she bought the property from him. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Husband</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Her current husband, William T. Newman, is the chief judge for the Arlington Circuit Court of the 17th Judicial Circuit in Virginia. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He presided over her divorce case! </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Ex-Husband</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Her ex-husband, Robert Johnson, supported Hillary, and got “in trouble” once for bad mouthing Obama around 2007-8. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the Daily Mail, the Clintons went with Robert Johnson to the Caribbean at one time in the past. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/blog/authors/rob-johnson">There is a Rob Johnson who works for the Clinton Foundation, but this is someone else.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His private equity firm, RLJ management, has a company called <a href="http://www.caribbeancage.com">Caribbean CAGE—The Caribbean and Latin American Gaming Company—which supplies casino machines to that area.</a> Its chairman, Bob Washington, is a part owner of the Charlotte Bobcats, and goes back as a lawyer to the BCCI scandal, one of his clients. This part of the company seems quite--the website has not been updated in over 3 years now...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RLJ Equity Partners has ties to the Carlyle group, which I only mention because of their “Most Favorite Status” among conspiracy theorists. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Ties To Hillary Clinton?</em> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sheila Johnson supported Obama. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She supported a Republican gubernatorial candidate Bob McDonnell, because of his conservative stance on marriage. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2013/05/06/paige-johnson-daughter-of-bet-co-founders-weds-dudley-payne-in-the-bahamas/">Uh oh! her daughter married a white guy!</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His name is Dudley Payne III, and he is an insurance broker and a serious amateur golfer. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Other</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The charity she is closely associated with, CARE, operates in about 95 countries, including Haiti. (I didn’t recognize their new logo, I remember it was the same company that seemed bigger to me in the 80s, when they ran those 2 minute commercials with kids from Africa and those “CARE packages”. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She’s a member of the Council of Foreign Relations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She designs scarves and related clothing articles. </p>
</li>
</ol></p>

        <p><p>Shit dude, talk about coming through.</p>
<p>Awesome work. Let me decipher this in the morning and see how it fits.</p>
<p>This is where it's to slot into:
https://m.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5ctc4w/i_found_something_autists_the_web_is_revealing/?compact=true</p>
<p>She has been seen with some of these other DC socialites. Trying to see how it fits together.</p>
<p>DM me, great to have serious heads in direct communication. </p>
<p>Seriously, top marks. </p></p>

        <p><p>Totally missed this the first go around...</p>
<p>Projet Aviation has been to Haiti. After the earthquake. </p>
<p>But all in all, for me, unless I missed something... Personally, I came away more impressed with their achievements than alerted by anything, quite honestly! </p></p>
