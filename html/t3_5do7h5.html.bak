        <p><p>Actually what they are saying is totally true, it has been verified by others. </p>
<p>Are you trying to police our discussion of Tavistock? </p>
<p>That "bullshit post" doesn't "need to be deleted," we need to be able to speak about this topic without censorship. If you have a problem with the topic of the thread then simple read a different thread. </p></p>

        <p><p>He's a total shill. From this first post right to the end he was spamming about how we shouldn't examine leads with solid evidence. All without showing any evidence or arguments.</p>
<p>I've also deleted his more annoying posts. I actually left up a few that were decent (it would appear that he was trying to get some comment  karma with several decent, if vapid, comments)</p></p>

        <p><p>I understood this post as referring to "Tavistock -influenced organizations in the US". That's what I discussed. If I mis-read the post I apologize, I was only trying to provide helpful information for anyone looking into Tavistock influence in US organizations. </p>
<p>I was not intending to discuss random conspiracy. </p>
<p>Also -if you read the Stratfor "dinner" email relating to Esalen" </p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/28/289346_re-sunday-dinner-.html</p>
<p>They are referring to Esalen as a future-designing think tank. This place hosted Boris Yeltzin in the 80's - so if it can be powerful enough to host the Soviet leader during the cold war, I think there's a strong possibility it is associated with American power players over in DC. It's video lending library studies Chernobyl... this is clearly a place that was not only interested in nudist retreats. </p>
<p>And I already showed you it is directly tied to Tavistock. </p>
<p>I felt it was on-topic to discuss, since the topic was US institutions rested to Tavistock. </p>
<p>Forgive me if I misunderstood the topic. Did not intend to distract. </p></p>

        <p><p>Not sure what it could mean yet, but it's worth noting that Trump went to Wharton...</p>
<p>EDIT: To all the downvoters, I've been a Trump supporter since the primaries and voted for him in the general, but we can't just stick our heads in the sand and pretend like there's no way for a possible connection here. I sure hope there isn't one, but we shouldn't just assume that's the case.</p></p>

        <p><p>First off, the entirety of pizzagate could be considered "random conspiracy bullshit", so I don't see what your point is when this has already long passed the 'absurdly-wide-reaching-phenomenon' threshold.</p>
<p>Secondly, how is anybody supposed to know where to dig for all the possible money trails if they aren't aware of all the possible connections? It's like some people around here think "concrete evidence" just appears out of thin air. No, you need to explore leads until you hit hard evidence, that's how it works.
If you only try to 'follow the money' with no new leads, you're doomed to be going in circles.</p></p>

        <p><p>No I wouldn't say the whole of pizza gate is completely random. The core allegations are very contentious and viable. And a very rapid expansion of the phenomena that is pizza gate give some proof that this is not your ordinary conspiracy theory. I haven't seen any new conspiracy  sub grow this fast ever</p></p>

        <p><p>I think plmnkoijbvhi is far to negative in this sub, but I would really like to know how this post is connected to the sub.  No one has answered that yet.</p></p>

        <p><p>I suspect it was due to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dof57/pedophile_island_the_2_trillion_tax_haven_the/">this development</a>, which is still being explored so it's not a totally solid connection yet, but there's enough there to prompt investigation.</p></p>
