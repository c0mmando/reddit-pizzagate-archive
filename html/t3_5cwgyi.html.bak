        <strong>pizza related map</strong>
        <p><p>Apologies if already covered and I missed it, but I keep thinking about the pizza related map - and how other people have been connecting the dots - but haven't seen this in particular. If you look again at the green poster: </p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/kHXqhi.jpg</p>
<p>I didn't notice it until the other day when someone pointed out the handkerchief under what looks of course, to be the child, in red. And that a 'pizza related map' is the sick twisted keepsake laid under the child to collect blood/semen etc. </p>
<p>And then came across this to further add weight to that. </p>

<p>SUBSTITUTES FOR BODY FLUIDS: THE MAGICAL LINK</p>
<p>I am often asked what a person can use for this type of rootwork if bodily fluids cannot be gotten. In descending order of strength, according to hoodoo folk magic, here is a list of substitute magical links:</p>
<p>Genital fluids: menstrual blood, semen, vaginal fluid 
Other biological concerns: urine, feces, sweat, blood, spit 
Hair: pubic, head, armpit, beard 
Person's unwashed clothing: underwear, socks, handkerchief 
Person's foot track lifted from the dirt 
"Shed" body items: nail clippings, baby teeth 
Person's bath water, wash water, drinking water 
Person's handwriting on paper 
Something Person owned or wore 
Something Person touched, e.g. butt from smoked cigarette 
Photo of Person 
Drawing or silhouette of Person 
Person's business card 
Person's full name written on paper 9 times
These items can be used for good or for evil; all that is indicated here is the relative strength of the tokens that represent the person.</p>
<p>Just wanted to add this. And keep up the fantastic work - you are doing work that has to be done.</p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks. Additionally, it may have again been already mentioned, but in checking located the artist of the art referenced above. I have just posted a separate thread about her in more detail. The artist's name is Kim Noble. Through years of ritual abuse she has documented dissassociative disorder and her alt persona who painted this and even more disturbing works, is known as Ria Pratt. I think there is A LOT that we can look into regarding Kim Noble and Ria Pratt. She appears to be a victim and allie and not a conspirator. AND the fact that they would use Kim's artwork in a Comet poster for a band date is just another layer of sickening and verification that we ARE clearing making good and valid links.</p></p>

        <p><p>Wait, was that the full poster? I thought someone from here added Noble/Pratt's art to demonstrate the feeling of disassociation. </p></p>

<p>Visual similarity or similarity in theme, but I haven't seen anything else that provides proof that Kim's artwork is a direct reference.</p></p>

        <p><p>Link to email where it's mentioned</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795</p>
<p>This struck me in the beginning too, there's a bit of urgency to her effort to return the handkerchief, with a map, that may be pizza related. This description is notably different from the description given by Katherine Tate. </p>
<p>It immediately strikes me as a souvenir or trophy from a serial offender. </p>
<p>There is also an out provided in the email, where the sender says feel free not to reply if this is not yours or you don't want it feel free not to reply, which he apparently doesn't, at least in this email chain. Again, I find this odd given the cordial nature of these emails. </p>
<p>In my opinion this invites speculation that map may be code for trophy. </p></p>

        <p><p>Absolutely, I saw something yesterday that described how pedophiles will place a hankerchief underneath in order to accumulate body fluid stains and hold these as trophies. Sick mofos. The artist who painted the painting above, was abused and painted several ones and the poor kids portrayed in them always have that square shaped thing underneath them which could portray a hankerchief. The post I had read mentionned that this had been confirmed by pedophiles. So podesta would have left a trophy. Sick fucker. </p></p>

        <p><p>my only question about the 'pizza related map' is, in a different thread, i saw someone assigning meanings to these code words.. 'pizza' being little girl, 'map' being semen, 'hot dog' being a little boy, etc... where do these come from? is it just speculation, or is it from FBI documents like the pedo symbols?</p></p>
