        <strong>Yelp removes all "news related" reviews from Comet Ping Pong Yelp page.</strong>

        <p><p>This is pretty common.  When a business makes news for whatever reason, it often gets flooded with reviews relevant to that news.</p>
<p>I wouldn't put much weight to this other than Yelp trying to protect the integrity of their product (useful reviews).  </p></p>

        <p><p>No idea why you were downvoted. But this is the exact reason why Yelp got so popular. Not only is it helpful for users, but it also helps the business owners against unfair comments [which is a real issue in not so well moderated sites, like 1 star votings for "i waited 5 minutes more than my neighboor!!!, the food was good tho"]. (Fairity aside, but at this point they can not know that this is not just bullshit without diving into the rabbit hole themself)</p></p>

        <p><p>Im not sure if you are joking or not (people usually aren't here) but if you are being serious its really not helpful to this to make presumptions like that. For the entirity of Yelp to be 'in on' something like that and from what I know about how a company like that operates, that would require justification from someone as to why they made that action, presumably to a team of people as its not just one guy.  Just isnt plausible in any sense.</p>
<p>What is more likely is that the owners of the pizza place noticied the flood in people calling them pedos and decided to contact yelp to stop that on their page as its effecting business.</p></p>

        <p><p>I truly believe it. This is bigger than local or domestic human trafficking. This is an elite global system. All these celebrities defending her are involved as well. So is the department of education, foreign leaders, and I think the rich owners of review websites know very well what I going on in these places and give the businesses involved special status and use code and symbols for insiders to know which places to go</p></p>

        <p><p>I think its much more likely that a pizza place getting bombarded with unfounded accusations of being operated by a cabal of satanic pedophiles on review sites might warrant removing said reviews. The people who are making those reviews are only hurting whatever this whole thing is.</p>
<p>Also, if it turns out it was a bunch of misinfo inserted into the podesta emails, people are ruining a business for nothing by making those reviews. Yelp is in the right to protect the integrity of their product. I highly doubt that many thousands of people are in on this, if this even really exists.</p></p>
