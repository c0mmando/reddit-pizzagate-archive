        <p><p>"CIBOLO CREEK ("RENT BOY") RANCH is a 30,000-acre VIP resort located in West Texas, 100 miles from the Mexican border, in the Chinati Mountains. Guests arrive by private jet at the ranch's own private airport. Rooms cost $500+ per night. </p>
<p>Guests of the ranch typically include Hollywood figures, politicians, and businessmen – but only the rich. </p>
<p>Previous guests have included Mick Jagger, Tommy Lee Jones, Randy Quaid, Dick Cheney, and Charlie Sheen – all of whom have been accused by others of being pedophiles. </p>
<p>The owner of Cibolo Creek "Rent Boy" Ranch is John Poindexter. He obtained the property in 1988. A 3rd-generation Texan, Poindexter runs a Houston-based manufacturing company, J.B. Poindexter &amp; Co. Poindexter is a leader in the ORDER OF SAINT HUBERTUS. </p>
<p>Thus the Cibolo Creek "Rent Boy" Ranch is often frequented by this international 17th-century hunting society, the ORDER OF SAINT HUBERTUS. This all-male Order was founded in 1695 by Austrian Count Anton von Sporck, although it just recently allowed women to join its elite hunts. </p>
<p>In 2010, 53 members of the ORDER OF SAINT HUBERTUS gathered at Cibolo Creek (Rent Boy) Ranch to hunt. Guests included minor royalty.</p>
<p>The USA branch of the ORDER OF SAINT HUBERTUS (aka the "American Knights") held its first-ever meeting at the Bohemian Club in San Francisco:  </p>
<p>The Bohemian Club is connected to Bohemian Grove, a large property located north of San Francisco which regularly hosts elite pedophile parties attended by international male politicians and businessmen. Both locations feature the pagan god Molech, who is depicted as an owl. </p>
<p>I and others, such as Fiona Barnett – who was trafficked from Australia – were taken to the Bohemian Grove as children, and we have witnessed pedophiles hunt for children amongst the redwood forest. Another version of the Bohemian Grove is what I believe this ranch to be – a place where rich people are able to hunt children down like animals – which is just one small aspect of their perverted and dark activities. </p>
<p>Hunting, raping, and killing children for sport is a common feature of elite pedophile gatherings. Alleged attendees at European pedophile hunts include King Albert II of Belgium, Dutch Crown Prince Bernhard, Prince Johan Friso of Holland and his wife Mabel Wisse Smit. "</p>

        <p><p>If you look up Jimmycomet's Instagram reference of <strong>WWDJD</strong> on the <a href="https://archive.fo/0fIhm"><strong>walk-in freezer photo</strong></a>, it leads to <strong>Chinati</strong> (the mountains where the ranch is).  </p>
<p>WWDJD stands for "what would Donald Judd do" which refers to his concrete art installation there.  </p>
<p>This implies that they do visit the area since they made the reference.  </p>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/xNY8N">This</a> is what I'm referring to.  </p>

<p>THE PIC IS FROM THE SAME GIRL nilaylawson "Just rinse it off when you're done." </p>

        <p><p>Remember when Dick Cheney was on an isolated Texas ranch when he shot someone in his group hunting "quail"???</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Cheney_hunting_incident#Shooting_incident</p>
<p>it took days for the TRUE story to come out and even then there were many holes in it   - much like Scalia -</p>
<p>ranch was near here: happened here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riviera,_Texas</p>
<p>MAP:  https://www.google.com/maps/place/27%C2%B017'55.0%22N+97%C2%B048'54.0%22W/@26.9976159,-98.4831949,171427m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d27.298611!4d-97.815?hl=en</p>
<p>looks to be close to the border as well -
 maybe they do the "Nowhere to Run" human hunts here? maybe it was a failed attempt to kill the guy </p></p>

        <p><p>Can we find any verification for any of this?  Don't spread this until we can find at least some kind of verification.  There is this thing called disinformation, which they use to get us discredited as "crazy conspiracy nuts."  Have no doubt about it, there are people in this subreddit actively posting stuff they know to be fake, in order make us look like crazies.  </p></p>

        <p><p>About John Poindexter - Owner of ranch</p>
<p>http://archive.is/a1Eqr</p>
<p>He helped the US Government with collecting and analyzing data, as in helping the NSA spy.  Creating the CAM project:</p>
<p>http://archive.is/kfmfX</p>
<p>Here is the business he has that worked with the government</p>
<p>http://archive.is/QLSlh</p>
<p><strong>TLDR: John Poindexter help create the data mining and sorting system the NSA uses against the Americans and the world...probably the system Snowden talks about.</strong></p></p>
