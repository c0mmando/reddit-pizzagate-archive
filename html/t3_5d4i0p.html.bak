        <strong>Why are mods locking posts?</strong>
        <p><p>I've now seen multiple posts of comments being locked by the mods here.. Why are they trying to silence conversation? We all understand not every lead will ultimately be fruitful, but who are you to leave stones unturned?</p></p>

        <p><p>Link the threads that have been locked without a good reason?  The ones have I seen have good reason to be locked, either to prevent bullshit or because there was an older more fruitful thread on the same topic.</p></p>

        <p><p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5d1s0w/possible_bombshell_most_png_attachments_in/">Here's one example.</a> Unfortunately the OP edited the initial post after the thread was locked, so you can't see the encrypted file anymore. I thought it was interesting, and at least worth looking into. However, a moderator posted "This is fucking stupid" and shut the thread down. I have a problem with this, especially when the post wasn't "fucking stupid" (although there are plenty of shit posts in this sub)</p></p>

        <p><p>The top post (below the sticky) explains why it is stupid.  There is a severe misunderstanding of how easy it is to decrypt or desteg these files.  If we are to be believed we are dealing with the most powerful people in the world, they are not simply going to change the file format. Converting an image file to unicode and then translating it is not going to yield anything.  You won't be able to find any embedded files without knowing the method by which it was embedded, or getting EXTREMELY lucky and using the exact software that works for that embed method.  The best news is that, at least in regards to these powerpoints and pictures, many were sent 4-8 years ago and so if we can limit ourselves to using steganalysis that is specific to steganographic methods from this time frame we might get lucky.   </p></p>

        <p><p>It offers a possible explanation for what motivates these people. It's equally worth considering as say a satanic cult. But I do feel that discussions like that are more appropriate for /r/conspiracy</p></p>

        <p><p>"Possible" is a ridiculously broad criteria. The cult thing wouldn't be plausible if it weren't for the symbols and spirit cooking revelations, for example. See the difference? Wild speculation versus a body of evidence?</p></p>

        <p><p>And that's why I recommended the conspiracy sub. Any idea or approach should be open to discussion, but I agree that this sub should be focused on actual evidence and not wild speculation</p></p>
