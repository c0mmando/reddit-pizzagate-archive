        <p><p>Stop harassing random places. Do you really want to bring the big fish down? I have no idea whether We the Pizza is real or fake (I think it was a troll), but doing this really ruins our reputation. Think about it. We the Pizza's customers could have heard about Pizzagate and supported us, if We the Pizza was a proper restaraunt.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not really sure if that's an admission of guilt. I'm pretty sure it's a subject that most restaurants probably want to get as far away as possible. Bad publicity and such.</p></p>

        <p><p>Anyone in their right mind would delete these comments, guilty or not. Last thing someone wants when their restaurant is googled is to have 'Child Pedo Trafficking' come up lol.</p></p>
