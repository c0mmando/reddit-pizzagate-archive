        <strong>Separating WikiLeaks seizure, disappearance of Assange from #pizzagate misses key point</strong>
        <p><p>There is understandable interest in minimizing off topic chatter.</p>
<p>However, keeping Assange and #pizzagate stories completely separate diminishes the impact of the "why" and "when" WRT the move on Assange.  Irrespective WikiLeaks status (best directed to /r/WhereIsAssange), one strong possibility is that it was a government seizure which they had been reluctant to do until now.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks had threatened new disclosures but the Podesta disaster WRT #pizzagate was probably already sufficient for TPTB to make a move.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think there is a possibility this is related. </p></p>

        <p><p>It was Assange's mistake to wait long enough for them to strike, at any rate no, they are not unrelated at all and if anyone thinks so they should remember that there is a larger picture here concerning Hillary Clinton's Campaign, the deleted emails that spurred this whole investigation and Wikileaks.</p></p>
