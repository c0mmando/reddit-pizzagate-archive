        <p><p>Very hard to see because of the cars but there is a family walking past the ping pong table. The screams are the loudest when they are across from the camera, and seem to stop when they leave frame. If you look carefully you can see a little girl (I'm assuming) between a couple and if I'm not mistaken the man is holding an even smaller child. If I would have to guess it would be that the girl was throwing a tantrum from not being able to play (she seems to stretch her hand out toward the table), or it's coming from the smaller kid. The first scream sounds like a generic kid screaming for whatever reason. Either way, the screams are way too loud for them to be coming from inside anywhere. At one point it's louder than the traffic, people would've heard them.</p>
<p>I took screenshots of the family. I am now 100% sure that nothing sinister is going on in this video. You can clearly see the family and the little kid's interest in the ping pong game. If you listen to the video on slow motion the first scream sounds like a generic child's scream. The next big scream sounds like "hey!" or "daddy!" Then "nooo", probably because they want to check out the game more and it seems like the parents are even dragging the kid along before they go off frame. You can also see the kid constantly looking back toward the game.</p>
<p>Look at these images and tell me what you think. http://imgur.com/gallery/B2uU1</p></p>

        <p><p>I think half the people here treat it as a game, the other half are gullible as hell. It's a continuation of the whole meme thing from /r/the_donald. If enough people agree to keep pushing it, it works. If you disagree, you're a shill. </p>

<p>It's not the admins role to remove narratives they don't like only information deemed dangerous for whatever reason.</p>

        <p><p>You're right, you can't determine what is true or false by what is being ignored or what is being censored, but censorship is like lighting that thing up and jumping up and down "look in this direction" when you're on the Internet. If someone is trying to hide something, it is for a good reason. If these things were not true, there would be no proof of them happening, and any circumstantial evidence can easily be ignored by those in power -  it is not proof, won't put anyone in jail, and no one is going to be lynched today. If these things didn't and aren't happening, there is no good reason to censor them. </p></p>

        <p><p>http://vocaroo.com/i/s1PgXSsHIDVL  first attempt at cleaning up the audio.  <br>
<em>By medic30420</em>       <br>
.   <br>
Video was recorded in 2007 showing playing pingpong close to the street is a hazzard ( so we can assume this was not a video whit added audio to create a hoax )  <br>
Also this video is from 2007 and uploaded on 2007 and noting was known about pizza gate at that point.    </p>
<p>.    <br>
Notice the camera is close to the ground ( and sound travels trough solid objects better as trough air )   <br>
Microphone,s pick up a lot of sound ( inc sound trough solid objects ).    <br>
No one can prob hear the audio in real life ( but the mic picks it up trough ground vibrations )   <br>
The sound is not comming from pingpong pizza sins u can not hear them play pingpong at all.     <br>
The kid screaming is A underground OR B behind the camera ( if it was behind the camera the guy recording would have heard it as well but he clearly did not )     <br>
Thus the sound is most likely from underground      <br>
The parents and the kid walking buy prob saw something ( or said something ) this is not what we should focus on </p></p>

        <p><p>0:36 The kid's noise breaks past the traffic. The sound is coming from the other side of the street. </p>
<p>If you listen very carefully you can hear the pingpong ball getting hit. Might need headphones for this. Also remember that more "bassy" sounds will travel further, like with car stereos. </p>
<p>In all honesty this video is not substantial. Kids tend to be noisy. It would be nice to know time this was filmed though. </p></p>

        <p><p>Be wary of confirmation bias.  Just because we know this thing is real doesn't mean every little thing is actual evidence.  This video strikes me as disinformation.  I listened and didn't hear "help me." People are projecting what they want to hear onto it.  Do you guys really think they would be doing this where it could be heard outside, across the street? Don't you think they would have been caught already if they were so careless?  Use your noggin, guys.  Please focus on solid evidence, and please stop promoting disinformants Ted Gunderson and David Icke.  The most effective disinformation tells a basically true narrative and mixes in something utterly ridiculous and unsubstantiated (e.g. Gunderson says there were no planes on 9/11, and Icke says the government is lizard people).  Promoting this will get us branded as a bunch of wild-eyed looney toons.  </p></p>

        <p><p>I agree.  There's absolutely a boat load of real evidence.  Maybe this is something and maybe it isn't, but there's a ton of indisputable stuff that would be better to focus on.</p></p>

        <p><p>The only way it could be that clear, through the traffic (which can be used as a benchmark for the volume level and range of sound), is if it was in, say a van behind the camera operator (there is a gas station there), or a manhole cover.</p>
<p>No, the sound is not <em>coming through the fucking concrete</em>, that's ludicrous, it is however, clear enough to discern it is coming from a location very close to that camera.</p>
<p>Edit: Furthermore, the sound would amplify if the child is indeed in a concrete tunnel, like those documented and existing in that area. For someone who does this for a living, that much would be obvious.</p></p>

        <p><p>Of course it's ludicrous, that's why I was telling him it's ludicrous</p>
<p>If there happened to be a tunnel with an opening nearby, then yes it's possible that the sound would be coming from there. I didn't take that into consideration, as OP was claiming it was being amplified by the concrete itself.</p></p>

<em>Materials such as brick, concrete block, wood floors, gypsum board, and tile do not absorb much sound, while carpet with foam padding and velour fabric are better at absorbing sound</em>     <br>

But my question is do we even know its concrete </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah I was gunna say something about that. Sounds movement isn't so simple as "sounds moves better through solid objects than air". Different frequencies all tend to just travel differently through certain things so the logic behind this isn't very solid. </p></p>

        <p><p>I think it's extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>But if the sound is coming from the Comet Ping Pong basement it would have to be coming through the manhole highlighted here:</p>
<p>https://imgur.com/a/icwD0</p>
<p>The camera was probably placed on the wall, which is a few feet away.</p></p>

        <p><p>Cleaner louder version:</p>
<p>https://clyp.it/cvm0iasb</p>

        <p><p>So the vibrations from the cars moving on the same street don't get picked up in the audio? But you know the screaming from kids in a underground dungeon go right through and blare into the microphone....</p></p>

<li>The fact that you cannot spell the word "through" is quite troubling and discredits you a bit. </li>
<li>If the sounds of the kids is coming from underground because sound travels <strong>through</strong> solid objects better, that doesn't prove anything considering we can hear some sounds from the players themselves. </li>
<li>I am in no way trying to discredit pizzagate as a whole, but this video proves absolutely nothing definitively and if you have been actively following this sub you know you are reposting. </li>

        <p><p>Some one,s spelling discrediting some one is mute point. <br>
I speak and can read 5 ( almost ) 6 languages but wen i wright i have huge problems ( any language even my own ) ty spelling  programs :)    <br>
The video indeed on its own is not enough evidence but a lot of minor negligible things are piling up slowly.   <br>
If we would just look at every piece on its own we can never solve a puzzle.    <br>
For a puzzle to be solved u need to add a lot of small pieces ( this being one of them ).       </p></p>

        <p><p>yes but you discuss it as if you have some sort of proof or information that these voices are definitively traveling through concrete from under ground tunnels (yes I know the tunnels exist). My point is that when you talk about something with certainty, but have no proof to back anything up, it does more disservice. Just present information and allow people to digest it without personal commentary unless you can prove something. Otherwise you just become another tin foil hat wearing crazy that no one will listen to. </p></p>

        <p><p>no it doesnt and nor was I attacking someone. I was pointing out that repeatedly misspelling words when you are trying to convince someone of something makes it difficult for people reading to accept your reasoning. I am ever so hurt that you claim to not have read the rest of my comment but took the time out of your precious day to respond to it. Well done. </p></p>

<p>Frank Winstead Gone Wild: The Recordings
AMANDA HESS  JUN 19, 2008 12 PM 13  Tweet  Share
You may remember ANC Commissioner Frank Winstead from his chillingly subtitled youtube video "Ping Pong in Public Space" or his chillingly subtitled youtube video "When UPS Delivers in D.C., Life Suffers."</p>
<p>Last Tuesday, Winstead staged a live performance at the packed-full ANC meeting held to reassess Comet Ping Pong's voluntary agreement with the commission. (Marc Fisher, hot on the Winstead beat, has his roundup here. DCist, too). During the course of the meeting, Winstead accused Comet owner James Alefantis of lying, cheating, stealing, spitting in a customers food, and encouraging both murderers and rapists.</p>

        <p><p>it seemed that guy was a curmudgeon who was opposed to the block being transformed into a late night party hub.  referring to apparent crime (rape and murder) that happens in Adams Morgan neighborhood, not that he suspected rapes and murders were going on at comet.</p>
<p>Let's keep this guy in perspective.  He wasn't filming on the suspicion of child trafficking, he was pissed about people playing ping pong on the sidewalk.  The "lying, cheating, and stealing" seemed to be in relation to Alefantis' breaking the terms of an agreement he had with local policy makers around business stuff like closing times, music volume, and hosting live bands.  </p>
<p>This is probably a kid having a tantrum and is not strong evidence. </p></p>

        <p><p>That may or may not be the same kid that is screaming. As the family walks away, you would expect the screaming voice to shift via the Doppler Effect as its frequency changes and the kid changes its position relative to the camera. The voice, however, seems to remain pretty consistent as though it is emanating from something stationary. Just my opinion, though.</p></p>

        <p><p>When the family walks away the screaming stops. The loudest scream is heard when the family is directly across from the camera. In a sense, the Doppler effect is exactly what is happening. You just don't notice it because you're used to a consistent sound with this phenomenon such as a train or plane going by. The volume of the scream still varies in this video, it's just not a consistent sound. As for why can you hear it clearly even when they're not on camera is because they're surrounded by concrete buildings which echo sound and it's being picked up on an in-camera microphone which captures everything in the area.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well lucky for you, no one is saying this is 100% an abducted child. Second and to use your loving words, if you had "brain in your skull", you would also want to consider the entire body of evidence, rather than just this one video. </p></p>

        <p><p>Let me play the skeptic. Maybe the kid accidentally locked himself in the restroom stall and panicked when he couldn't get the door unlocked. I am with you on the pizza gate issue, but in order for something to be proof, you have to eliminate all other possibilities. </p></p>

        <p><p>How could it be heard outdoors if the origin is indoors? And across the streer?</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes and others are saying it came from the basement. My point is that we don't know and there could be an explanation other than a kidnapped child.</p></p>

        <p><p>Then you responded to the wrong person? Someone gave a "what if" and someone else gave a reason why that wouldn't make sense. The person you responded to didn't say they know where it came from, they simply continued the discussion based on the assumption the previous comment made.</p></p>

        <p><p>They said that because the person THEY responded to said "what if it came from a bathroom stall?" He wasn't saying that "that can't be BECAUSE the origin IS indoors" he said that it wouldn't make sense because that would IMPLY it would be indoors and across the street and the sound wouldn't be able to travel that well to the camera.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not jumping to conclusions yet, but who the hell blocks the main entrance of their restaurant with a ping pong table? Especially when according to pictures of the restaurant, it's filled with ping pong tables. I doubt they were full. And even if all the tables were full, who would want to play ping pong on a busy sidewalk at night?</p>
<p>The sketchy details of this place just keep stacking up. </p></p>

        <p><p>Sorry, but it is the family walking past the ping pong table. The daughter wants to either play or watch the game but the family keeps walking. She shouts, "Mommy, mommy!"</p>
<p>At 0:37 you can see her doing a gesture with her arm, shouting "hey!" as she looks at the ping pong table.</p></p>

        <p><p>The issue is, the relative volume of the kid remains static as the kid/couple walk past the table and out of frame. The kid's voice should naturally taper off as the distance changes between the microphone and vocal source. This is not the case.</p></p>

        <p><p>The screaming stops after they leave the camera. The loudest scream you hear is when they're directly in front of the camera. The volume of the screams are not static. You are hearing what you are describing you just don't notice it because it's not a consistent sound such as a vehicle traveling by. The reason it's clear at all when they're off camera is because they're surrounded by concrete buildings which echo the sound and it's being picked up on an in-camera mic that captures every sound in the area.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't get the people in this thread, I think half of them are pushing this just for disinformation. It's been posted before and most people in that thread see and understand it's coming from the kid. Here are pictures of the family in the video: http://imgur.com/gallery/B2uU1.</p>

        <p><p>we still have no hard facts just small puzzle pieces ( its not proof they molested a kid or some one is locked up ) its just fishy as fuck       <br>
A kid in the building behind him might have locked themselves in the bathroom and u would get the same sound </p></p>

        <p><p>You're crying over this confirmation bias echo chamber of a thread? It's already been essentially disproven below and it wasn't anything remotely damning even if it's real. I believe in parts PizzaGate and there is something incredibly fucked up going on, but this isn't it.</p></p>

        <p><p>Key word "imagine". That's what everyone in this thread is doing. They're imagining its coming from some underground dungeon or from some locked room in the building and they want to believe it, so they do. When you can clearly see the kid walking by with their family: http://imgur.com/gallery/B2uU1. </p></p>

        <p><p>This was posted in 2007 what the hell. Who is the uploader "Frank Winstead" ? Why the subtitles of the video ask if it is legal to ping pong next to a 6 lanes road, I don't quite get it.</p>
<p>Edit : Apparently he's a ANC Commissionner (Advisory Neighborhood Commissions), he makes video on traffic disturbance and caught this. Was this place stormed by police since then at least ? Unless the screams come from behind the camera ?</p></p>

<p>If you look up any articles on this topic you'll see tons of weird astro-turfed comments underneath them from that time frame. Like a prototype version of Correct The Record.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't think the old idiot even noticed the screams. He was too upset by the ping pong and UPS deliveries. </p>
<p>Maybe he knew what was going on but tried to pop them for some other disturbance that he could actually prove. Kinda like Al Capone and money laundering vs murder/extortion/gambling etc.</p></p>

        <p><p>take a piece of string and 2 cups ( tighten the string ) then speak on 1 end and listen on the other end ( same idea ) but now the sound travels trough the wire and ends up in the cup.  <br>
Instead of the sound traveling trough the ground and ending up in the microphone </p></p>

        <p><p>There are people playing ping pong on the street. A family walks by with there kid who screams. People in this thread think the kid is screaming from a sex dungeon located underground that can be picked up loudly on the camera but for some reason no one on the street can hear it.... when you can obviously see the kid walking by and match the screams with their movement: http://imgur.com/gallery/B2uU1</p></p>

        <p><p>Reminds me of the video where u can hear a woman screaming for help from the basement of El Duce , the so called contractkiller of Kurt Cobain. It was filmed by a BBC crew i think.</p></p>

        <p><p>That brought me to tears.</p>
<p>Anyone that spends time interacting with children is able to discern what that is.</p>
<p>That is a child, screaming for help, and not because they are trapped in a bathroom.</p>
<p>Based on the location, it is very obviously coming from a manhole, and likely the tunnels beneath DC/Pedopizza joints.</p>
<p>I couldn't finish watching that. God damn.</p></p>

        <p><p>Is this a joke or a push for disinformation? This has already been posted and dis-proven to be anything. You can see the kid across the street with their family walking by.</p>

        <p><p>I was pretty sure this wasn't anything substantial at first, but i'm a little less sure now after listening to it closer, due to certain bits in the vid which i'll discuss below. Someone else pointed out there was a manhole not far behind where the video was likely taken. If the tunnels under the street are truly being used, I guess the screams may be coming up from the manhole, from a child that's underground. If that's the case, the manhole is right by a petrol station, we need to find out if randomers have been hearing odd noising while filling up. Also better equipment should be able to pickup more from the manwholes right? These are things worth looking into I suppose.</p>
<p>The reason I think it's nothing shady is because the source of the sounds seems to be moving. The 1st screams at 0:14 are louder and seem to be closer than the rest. The latter screams are quieter and further away. At first I thought they were affected by the moving traffic, and that the screams were from the kid in the shot, and that they were crossing the road at 0:15. It sounded like the kid was screaming "daaaad!", perhaps trying to draw attention to an approaching car (the one that appears at 0:26). The kid keeps looking back, so perhaps he dropped something while they were crossing..</p>
<p>Now the 2nd set of screams I'm not too sure about, it sounds like there's more than 1 kid, and if so then perhaps if just kids running about on the side of the street opposite Comet, behind the camera.</p>
<ul>
<li>0:37 - "Hey!"</li>
<li>0:38 - "HEY!"</li>
<li>0:39 - Sound from another kid, bit further away.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sounds that come later, sound like a kid calling "David". Now the shouts that start at ~0:49 were a bit chilling, they could alos be "David", but kinda do sound like "help me" coming from a fixed location. But with sounds like this you could probably hear and believe it's many things being said, and a child underground doesn't match up with the other screams. I do think this is a red herring, but would welcome someone to look into it further and prove it is infact a red herring somehow.</p></p>

        <p><p>it's just too odd and inconvenient to play ping pong next to busy road. they are either lookouts for police or other. makes sense, each could keep eye in each direction. Or they are a distraction from what is taking place across the street or next door at besta. </p></p>

        <p><p>http://vocaroo.com/i/s1VLR5BVgI5n - Just cleaned the audio from this video using iZotope RX, full clip here. </p>
<p>This may help a little more than the other edits. Removed most of the white noise and added some more gain and compression. </p>
<p>I would check listening to this one out over the others so far, it sounds the best.</p>
<p>It's 1m:10s long, please post time stamps with quotes of what you're hearing so we can get an idea of whats going on here. </p>
<p>Thanks. </p></p>
