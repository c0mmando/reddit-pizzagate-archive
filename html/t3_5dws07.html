        <strong>Shame, Sociopaths don't feel it.</strong>
        <p><p>The shame they have brought to this country. They have fouled this country for generations to come. Every single soul that has died for this country for its freedom, that makes it so special. Then we get these greedy, megalomaniacs break up our country by pushing equality making it an "ISSUE" all of our current problems are caused by us! Now we are so divided in to so many groups and sub groups causing multiplying the conflict. My fears are now real, what is going to happen to us. They have shamed us so much, it may be un repairable.  Would he take us all down with him? This is the tragedy of the century! The vets will feel so betrayed. Such such horrible evil. Its weird. To the Left she seemed like their savior, to us we knew she was the devil in disguise. By the time it actually sinks in the rage! And what do the Clintons feel, nothing, they have become so corrupted and hollowed out. A Multi billionare, and the most powerful Politicians in the world can do anything they want. Then when they can't get off on anything anymore, cant get the adrenaline going because you have become numb from the wealth. You need a new high, something to give you that adrenaline rush you so crave. Then bam... pedo ring. Live modestly, have as little debt as possible and enjoy life. Would I want to be a billionare. No WAY! THE CLINTONS AND POSSIBLY OBAMAS NEED TO GO BEFORE US, ALL OF THE AMERICANS THAT TRUSTED YOU, THAT YOU WERE KEEPING US SAFE, AND HELPING US TO PROSPER. NO YOU HAVE MADE US THE SHAME OF THE AGES. FOREVER THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, EXPLAIN, APOLOGIZE, THEN BE EXILED TO ANTARTICA FOR SHAMING OUR COUNTRY </p>

        <p><p>I am not too sure that it is a mental illness, A few trickcyclists I have known tell me that its only another variation in human personality, there are plenty more law abiding psychopaths than there are crazy ones. Is that right, if anyone could confirm this?</p></p>
