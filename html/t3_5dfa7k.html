        <strong>Julian Assange's interception is vital to the situation.</strong>
        <p><p>This is probably obvious to most of you, but I think it's important to consider if you are skeptical about this case. I apologize if this topic has already been run through. </p>
<p>The Podesta emails were dropped on the 7th of October. Ten days later Assange has his internet sapped and very well may have been killed or covertly captured. </p>
<p>It would seem that these emails, which have been an extremely effective catalyst to what could be one of the biggest public discoveries of America's existence, were the final straw for the 'States. </p>
<p>It's plausible that after this information got dropped, they couldn't take any more chances with Assange. I don't think he had much more information pertaining to pizzagate, but if he did, the people involved would be swiftly screwed. </p>
<p>So, why else would the government decide to remove and imitate Assange at a time like that? Why not sooner? I think it was the final straw. If we prove that this shit is happening, we vindicate more than 40 years worth of conspiracy theorists telling us about how the government is run by devil-worshipers and cultists. The structure of this country will, frankly, collapse entirely. This web must cover so many people at the top that they know no citizen could ever trust the government again if this came to light. </p>
<p>I have not dived into conspiracy theories before this event. I applaud every citizen investigator working on this situation. This is for countless children, and for the integrity of the future.</p>
<p>Furthermore,</p>
<p><em>It would be naive to think that humans haven't been pushing the boundaries of depravity for a long time now, and what better place to do it than at the top, where money, power, and blackmail can keep you out of jail, out of public view, and out of scrutiny respectively</em></p></p>

        <p><p>I'm extremely worried about Assange's situation.  The mismatching hashes on the most recent file dump, as well as Wikileaks not even signing their own press release with their PGP signature points strongly to the idea Wikileaks has been compromised.</p></p>

        <p><p>There's no reason for all of those issues besides Assange's removal. They're taking their time making it look natural. </p></p>

        <p><p>I don't think there is any question about Assange and the twitter account. The only left to wonder about, in my opinion, is whether the site itself is compromised. I have no idea on that but it does seem like most everything released up to this point is legit but that now they may be removing things from the database in an effort to erase the evidence. </p></p>

        <p><p>We should think about what victory and defeat actually look like in this situation.</p></p>

        <p><p>For them, we all hit a dead end and the media stays silent. His death would be a big step towards exactly that.</p></p>
