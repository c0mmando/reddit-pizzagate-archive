        <p><p>People are writing this off like some kind of overly paranoid, anti-liberal conspiracy shit, and the constant attempts to point out the clinton's connections and satanism makes us all look just a little too tinfoil-hat like. We need to focus on showing the ACTUAL evidence, the more believable stuff, before people hear about the more...crazy aspects of this whole thing.</p>
<p>I do believe there's something far more complex and sinister than what's already being proven, but the average person is going to scoff at all that and write us off as a bunch of lunatics. This article is proof of this and we should seriously make an effort to show the basic facts so far, what's concrete, before diving down the rabbit hole. </p></p>

        <p><p>I agree with you. There's definitely something going on here....something bad. Everyone is doing great but we need to find that one piece of "OH FUCK!" evidence and it's hard because this thing has spiderweb'd out. </p></p>
