        <p><p>Equally disturbing is the fact that the state keeps a database of all newborns DNA.</p>
<p>When your baby is born, they prick the baby's heel and take several drops of blood (which are put on a paper card) to test for rare metabolic disorders. Sounds fine, right? Except, the state does not dispose of the cards after the test is complete - they store the card with your baby's DNA. And, they can sell the DNA to 3rd parties! </p>
<p>They literally have the DNA of every baby born in the US for the past 20-30 years!</p>
<p>Alex Jones has talked about this for years, and now he is being proven correct.</p>

        <p><p>Home birth is not always an option, especially if the mother has pre-existing conditions or a high risk pregnancy. And, even with a home birth, I am pretty sure the midwife would do the test herself in the home. Unfortunately, it is a pretty difficult test to "opt out" of without having CPS called on you. (The rationale being that the rare metabolic disorders they test for can cause severe brain damage if not caught early, so a parent would be "medically negligent" to refuse testing.)</p></p>

        <p><p>As a child in elementary school, we got these ID cards that were supposedly for our parents in case we got kidnapped. They were updated every year and had all current info, height, weight, address, etc. The weirdest thing that I never thought about until recently was they also got our finger prints. </p>
<p>I could be over thinking it, but the conspiracy theorist in me doesn't like that they have my finger prints and all info on me growing up. Seems wierd. </p></p>
