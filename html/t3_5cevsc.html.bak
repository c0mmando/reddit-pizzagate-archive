        <strong>Anyone else get a serious mk ultra / monarch programming vibe from all this?</strong>
        <p><p>Not gonna lie, I've been down the mk ultra rabbit hole before but wasn't entirely too sure about it, but a ton of what I've seen come out of this story completely lines up with it. To the point I think it's actually a major issue and may be more rampant than we even anticipated. Thoughts? </p></p>

        <p><p>yeah before pizza gate I came across T Podesta's art... if there is a theme besides just creepy pedo  it seems to pretty much be mk ultra. Even Abromovic talks about a performance state (dissociation) in order to push yourself to limits you couldn't before. 
And the arch of hysteria...why anyone would want to see that every day is beyond me. What charcot did to his patients is tantamount to torture. Check out the  2d art by that sculpture artist- looks like another example of a classic dissociative artist to me. It's like there are mk ultra fingerprints everywhere. </p>
<p>The thing is..if MK Ultra continued and were used as planned these are the exact folks that would be being blackmailed.  Also the state department is exactly who would use mked human messengers/head files. Maybe these are podesta's "other channels." Ugh. in the old days I'd say that means we have to find a CIA connection too because who is "handling" this ring of handlers?</p></p>

        <p><p>Very possible. They would abuse the kids so bad to the point that it fractures their minds, to create multiple personalities. They can create the perfect assassin that way, or drug dealer, ect. Because one personality wouldn't be aware of the other. </p></p>

        <p><p>Super tl;dr: MKUltra is a CIA mind control program. 
I haven't looked into Monarch but I assume it's very similar (if not part of the same project).</p>
<p>What has been proven: They have been confirmed basically stealing children for their tests/whatever else.</p>
<p>What has been speculated: Look up Cathy O'Brien and listen to her speak about it. She claims to have been a subject of MKUltra until she was rescued. She alleges the "mind control" (or the extent of the CIA's knowledge of the brain and how to manipulate it) was so advanced that they basically "partitioned" the brain so that even if you were to <em>try</em> to remember their abuse, they wouldn't be able to. Furthermore, they allegedly could develop multiple personality disorders on their subjects and even control their behavior. O'Brien claims she was involved in drug running assignments for the Bushes and Clintons. </p></p>

        <p><p>Project Monarch is what Kathy O'Brien claims MKULTRA became after it was "shutdown". Similiar to how Project Artichoke became MKULTRA. </p>
<p>Project Bluebird &gt; Project Artichoke &gt; Project MKULTRA &gt; Project Monarch</p></p>
