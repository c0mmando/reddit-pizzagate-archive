        <strong>BIG possible link to Obama</strong>
        <p><p>Big Cheese Photo LLC has been mentioned before. Here is a link to the photo galleries featuring some truly odd compiliations of "Stock photos" priced at nearly $700 each. </p>
<p>There is an Asian girl pictured, ... and often without a shirt. There is a specific photo where she is painting and obviously naked. Tags in the photo include "bare naked" "bare" "nude" ect. The photo in itself is just weird. No person wants to use that as a stock photo.
Warning: link to photo
http://www.fotosearch.com/BCP119/bcp019-20/</p>
<p>Here is the same girl fully clothed:
http://www.fotosearch.com/BCP108/bcp008-24/</p>
<p>Close up of her face:
http://www.fotosearch.com/BCP108/bcp008-26/</p>
<p>Now look at the girl that Obama is sitting with. I don't know, maybe I am being ridiculous but it looks like the same girl. Any idea who this girl is sitting on his lap?? The photographer took these photos in Seattle, so if we can track this girl back to there it is probably the same one photographed.

        <p><p>This is definitely a different girl, cheeks are thinner, and the eyes are further apart than Obama's niece. Honestly seems like a big stretch, the Obama picture is a totally normal playful picture. It only looks weird if you're looking at it with that bias, I have little adopted sisters from China and I could easily see myself in a picture like that tickling and playing around with them. </p>
<p>But I'll tell you what, the title on that lollipop photo though: "Stock Image of Young girl working on a giant lollipop." wtf</p></p>

        <p><p>One thing Idk if you noticed, and is most likely just a coincidence, look at the shape of that lollypop...</p>
<p>Concentric heart shapes... As in, identical to the paedophile symbols in that FBi document...</p></p>

        <p><p>I wouldn't rely too much on those symbols. Easily dismissed as coincidences and you are probably noticing shapes like that more often now.</p>
<p>Baader Meinhof syndrome makes you discover these symbols everywhere. I'd try to go after something more concrete.</p>
<p>Though we should keep tabs on these companies using it in their logo.</p></p>

        <p><p>Oh definitely agreed, its tenuous at best.</p>
<p>However, after how many times do coincidences stop being coincidences? </p>
<p>I'm not really convinced by this whole pizzagate thing myself yet, I just thought it was a comment that should be made!</p></p>
