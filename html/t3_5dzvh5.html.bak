        <strong>Is Julian Assange safe? Check out the concerns at https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereIsAssange/</strong>
        <p><p>New Ip address suddenly, suddenly misspelling common names/terms. Wikileaks starts criticizing people and causes they normally support.  A post that looks like a dead man's switch and same day a flight to Smithfield army base from London. Smithfield is a rendition base like Guantanamo.   1 month no response to thousands asking for proof of life.More!</p>

        <p><p>+1 OP</p>
<p>If we are to find out the truth behind pizzagate, it is an absolute necessity to find Assange.</p></p>

        <p><p>How is posting a bunch of speculation regarding what may have happened to Julian Assange going to help us find Assange?</p>
<p>I'm all for investigating what happened to Julian Assange but that is a completely different investigation/topic.</p>
<p>All posting stuff like this in this subreddit is going to do is fill it up with spam and make it hard for anyone actually looking for Pizzagate information to find anything of substance.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's one post, not a dozen, and certainly not spam.
Finding Assange is far more important in the macroscopic scale of things.</p>
<p>It was Assange who leaked the evidence for pizzagate and now he has disappeared.
At the very least we need to ascertain and distinguish whether he is safe, or he is not.</p>
<p>Anyone who has followed pizzagate from it's early stages knows how passive MSM is about stories that matter.
The only solid evidence we have of Assange being in the embassy during the past month, is <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/julian-assanges-cat-spotted-wearing-shirt-collar-and-tie-and-even-gets-its-own-twitter-account-a3395131.html">embassy cat</a> wearing a fucking tie.</p></p>

        <p><p>No one disagrees that finding out what happened to Assange is important. That is why the subreddit /r/WhereIsAssange exists. </p>
<p>But having this discussion here will only detract from the Pizzagate investigation. </p>
<p>They are two separate investigations and need to be treated as such.</p></p>

        <p><p>Should have said fuck it, pulled the trigger and released everything. Now he is prob dead jim. You cant negotiate with something like this. The only way to protect yourself is to wake everyone in the general population up and destroy thoes involved. What do you think would have happened if hillary had won? It was a very close thing as it was. </p></p>

        <p><p>This could be related. Assange promised a Hillary bombshell before the election was over but it never came (could it of exposed her pizzagate connection?). The Podesta files just kept leaking but it's suspected they were on a timer. Since Julian was cut-off from the outside world there has been no solid evidence to show Julian is alive and well, let alone in the Embassy.</p></p>

        <p><p>If this is the purpose of the post you should have explained in your initial post what the twitter attack was, when it is taking place specifically, what you are trying to accomplish, and how someone interested in that could be a part of the attack. You did not explain any of that.</p></p>
