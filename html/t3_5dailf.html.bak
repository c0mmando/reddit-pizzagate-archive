        <strong>Connections to Jared Google and associates?</strong>
        <p><p>Has anyone taken the names and locations related to Jared Fogle's (subway spokesman) case to see if there are any common connections?</p>
<p>Just a random thought I had... I have not been researching as much lately, but thought I would make the suggestion.</p>
<p>Also, looking at other child trafficking and pedophilia cases could help draw some connections. There might be some people that were indicted or convicted that could be connected to our current lists of suspects.</p></p>

<p>"During a pre-gig talk with the audience, Kleinman refers to Jared Fogle, saying that he used to like to come down here. When several audience members add that he also likes young boys and children, Kleinman laughs and says: </p>

<p>"Well, we all have preferences." </p>

        <p><p>Preferences as if liking children is just a "preference". Sounds like a major pedo sympathizer YUCK</p></p>
