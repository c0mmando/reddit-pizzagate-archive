        <p><p>Cathy O'brien has claimed for over two decades, consistently, at times with tears streaming down her face, that she was the subject of ritualistic sexual abuse at the hands of the Clintons. </p>
<p>This happened when she was a child. </p>
<p>So many people dismissed her as crazy. </p>
<p>Now that we've learned so much about what these politicians are into, I think it's time for us to take Cathy absolutely seriously. </p>
<p>I am convinced she was telling the truth, and that they really carved up her genitals, and that Hillary Clinton forced her to perform sexual acts as a child. </p></p>

        <p><p>Does the idea of reaching out to Cathy resonate with anyone here? Hearing what her thoughts on pizzagate might be insightful. If she was taken through any pizza shops... Never thought id even be typing this. </p></p>

        <p><p>Believing in things you have seen is not all that surprising. Believing in lizard people is also common among Ultra mind controlled people. Put two and two together and it sounds like one of their tricks. </p>
<p>Other people who have been tortured say even weirder things. It is one of the reasons why people so often do not take them seriously. </p></p>

        <p><p>Lets walk this path for a moment. Ms. O'Brian was supposedly subjected to brainwashing and as she calls 'mind control' - likely just trigger word manipulation. Wasn't the CIA in large part brainwashing and using drugs like LSD to control people? I could definitely see how she would 'see' lizard people if she were pumped full of drugs all the time.</p></p>

        <p><p>Between the trauma and psychadelics/hallucinogens it's very plausible.</p>
<p>A lot of folklore and ancient demonology probably comes from a shaman or tribe member eating something bad and having a fever dream or trip and the vision get's incorporated into lore.</p></p>

        <p><p>I believe you are referring to MK Ultra. CIA induced people into "mind controlled" states using LSD (So the story goes). David McGowan wrote a book ("Programmed to Kill") about many subjects including drug induced mental tampering techniques done in the 60's-80's. Really cool read. </p>
<p>Funny enough he also covered various times intl. Sex trafficking rings were shut down over the past 40 years or so. </p></p>

        <p><p>They have a very systematic way of splitting the psyche in the victim. That way that can implant whatever symbols or triggers they like. That's how they are controlled and that's the symbolism you see in a lot of the weird pizzagate art being tossed around </p></p>

        <p><p>Child abusers have a tendency to wear masks to hide their face from the victim. Its normal to use masks associated with nightmares, so if a child ever recalls the abuse and asked to describe the suspect, the victim begins to sound crazy. </p>
<p>The basic MO: Drug the kid and rape them with a demonic mask on.</p>
<p>This tactic has been used by ritualistic child sex abusers for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Even the entire idea of satanic cults is really just a tired cover story for child abuse. 
- "hey honey why do you have a devil mask"
- "oh dont worry thats just the boys club im a part of, some of the members are into some weird stuff but I only go for the connections and drinks"
- "hey honey why did janet say there were small children at your boys club"
- "oh dont worry thats some of the weirder members practicing ritualistic Talmudic sacrifices. ill stop going if it makes you feel better"</p></p>

        <p><p>Here's something to keep in mind though, her mind could of been tormented as a child to believing in that for the purpose of being able to discredit her later on. Oh look at this silly girl accusing me of doing these things to her, but she isn't right in the head, lizard people? Now that's a funny one.</p>
<p>It's so easy for a Predator to twist the mind of an impressionable child as a means for making their story seem like total make believe.</p>
<p>Believe in Santa? Tooth Fairy? Easter Bunny etc etc, childish things we believe in once before because the adults we trusted told us those things were real.</p></p>

        <p><p>If such a program did exist, they would break subjects to have a very warped false sense of reality, implanting things into their minds about reality that may not be true, so that if they were released, or freed somehow, when they retold their stories of what happened to them and started talking about a certain thing, like lizard people, it would instantly, to most people, negate everything else said as well. </p></p>

        <p><p>Is anyone else getting frustrated with the FBI?  They're apparently stonewalling/stalling the investigation.  That makes them complicit for every kid that is getting hurt <strong>right now</strong> as long as the Clintons and their associates are allowed to walk free.</p>
<p>Where's the NYPD in this?  Supposedly, they threatened to start leaking immediately b/c the stuff on Weiner's computer was so fucked up.  They backed off for the feds, but nothing is happening.  The "system" is stalling the investigation and the worst of the crimes are unlikely to ever be addressed.</p>
<p>Its time for individual agents/officers to stand up and get whatever info they can into the public domain.  The Clintons will never stand before a court-of-law until the court-of-public opinion forces it.  Unless individual agents/officers of conscience take responsibility and step up, the system is going to allow child trafficking pedos to keep their positions of power.</p></p>

        <p><p>Pretty sure if fucked up shit like this came out he wouldn't be able to just pardon them. If he did, there would literally be a revolution. There is absolutely no way people would just let that shit slide. Unless you mean he could somehow pardon them without the public hearing about it.</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree.  Obama could pardon all three Clintons, the Podestas, and all the aids, the entire Clinton Foundation down to the janitor, and the press wouldn't bat an eyelash.   From what I understand, you can be pardoned for potential crimes you may have done in the past but are currently unknown.   The only way to make this work is if Trump pretends he has no intention of prosecuting any of them.   Then Obama has to decide, because pardoning people implies they have broken the law.   Obama wouldn't want to harm his legacy if he didn't have to.  No doubt the Clintons have dirt on Obama to leverage him with.   For all we know, Trump discussed this with Obama when they met in person.   Trump could have told Obama that they will not pursue anyone in the Obama administration except Clinton-folk if he does not pardon any of them.  Obama may have requested that Trump stay quiet about all this stuff until after Obama leaves office.  After all, he wouldn't want the final weeks of his presidency to be besmirched by the most disgusting scandal in US history.   All speculation, but one thing makes sense, and that is that Obama has the power to make sure these people all get away with it.</p></p>

<p>FBI is now complicit. </p>
<p>I need your help. Motivate the good workers, try to help people that are getting attacked by dis-creditors. </p>
<p>Lots of people around these parts trying to paint us wackos. Please defend them, there are agents on reddit, and pizzgate HAS been compromised, do not trust the mods. </p>
<p>Take what I say as a grain of salt, you shouldn't necessarily trust me either - please do your own research, and research the mod history of this very sub.</p>
<p>Keep working, friend.</p></p>

        <p><p>i dont think the context implied she was immune to std, just that since she was a "presidential model" (gag) she was guaranteed to be clean</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm just curious, has anyone here ever researched the Franklin Scandal in Nebraska? I've always taken interest in missing persons cases, but I stumbled upon the case of Johnny Gosch a few years back. It led me down quite the rabbit hole; it all started with the missing boy, but quickly escalated into money-laundering, child trafficking, satanic rituals, the White House, the involvement of prominent politicians (including the Clint0ns), cover-ups starting with a local sheriff's dept all the way up to the FBI &amp; CIA, mysterious "suicides", etc. Many of the victims, participants, &amp;witnesses are now dead (btw, this only took place somewhere in the 1980's), and it's essentially been labeled a conspiracy theory by all law enforcement agencies. There's so many parties involved, but I've now got a renewed interest in trying to trace some of its profits back to their sources.</p></p>

        <p><p>I hope you're right- but this series of arrests could also have been psyops to cement that thought in American's minds as well. Kind of like cleaning your room in a really shitty way at the last minute just before your parents get home.</p></p>

        <p><p>When I heard "Near Death Trauma Centre"... look at this... </p>
<p><strong>"Relationships Between Mind Control Programming and Ritual Abuse</strong>  by Ellen P. Lacter, Ph.D., 2007</p>
<p>"Installation of mind control programming relies on the capacity to dissociate, which permits the creation of new walled-off personalities to ‚Äúhold‚Äù and ‚Äúhide‚Äù programming. Already dissociative children are prime ‚Äúcandidates‚Äù for programming. Alternatively, very young children may be made dissociative by trauma-based programming. The extreme abuse inflicted on young children in intra-familial satanic and abusive witchcraft cults reliably causes dissociation." </p>
<p>"1. <strong>Torture involving states of extreme pain and terror, to the point of near-death, is required to install mind control programming.</strong> These states are induced through electroshock, toxins that cause pain or temporary paralysis, assault, painful bondage or pressure, rape,, extreme cold (submersion in ice water is common), heat, burning suffocation, near-drowning, spinning, hanging, inversion, exposure to torture, mutilation, or murder of others, and/or prolonged isolation, starvation, dehydration, or sensory deprivation. States of despair, self-hatred, paranoia, and global distrust of humanity, are also effective. These are induced through forcing the child to hurt or kill others, often loved ones and pets, sexual humiliation, convincing the child that all important attachment figures are abusers, and convincing the child that he or she is now controlled and overseen by surgically implanted monitoring devices or ‚Äúspiritual assignments‚Äù of demons, malevolent spirits, curses, hexes, vexes, claims"</p>
<p>2 - "Children must be very young in order for mind control programming to be initially installed, under 4 or 5 years of age. Modifications to the original programming can be made later."</p>
<p>3- <strong>One of the central functions of most mind control programs is to cause the victim to physically and psychologically re-experience the torture</strong> used to install the programming"</p>
<p>When I read this article it is the process described on this website going on here. The full article is very eye opening.  This is just a very small summary. </p>
<p>This is from website http://endritualabuse.org/about/relationships-between-mind-control-and-ritual-abuse/    http://archive.is/F7VaB</p></p>

        <p><p>Cathy's account is verified by Brice Taylor.  </p>
<p>‚ÄúThanks for the Memories‚Äù Brice Taylor</p>
<p>For my use as a sexual slave, I was trained to make love to married couples by always bringing the focus back to them. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt your wife beautiful! Isn‚Äôt your husband strong,‚Äù or, whatever statements would strengthen their bond and love for each other, if they were to be kept together. When I got through with couples they were totally enamored with each other and hardly noticed when I dressed and left the room. I was used in this way with the Clintons. There was usually cocaine, often a gift from someone they knew, routed through me.</p>
<p>Sex slaves were used to sexually service both male and female members of the White House when our controllers called for it, and I was not to be exempt. Once when I was flown to the White House from Hawaii, Hillary played what she called ‚Äúthe tease game.‚Äù She tied me up so she could be safe, she said. When she was through with me she looked at her gold watch, said she had to go, put on her dress and left. I put on my clothes and headed out to the waiting limo to Henry [Kissinger].</p>
<p>Henry always wanted to know exactly what Hillary‚Äôs verbal responses were to things I said to her and he listened very carefully for speech patterning. They were trying to create a phrase of words that would stop her dead in her tracks when she went to court for the Whitewater incident. They had been planning this one even before Clinton took office. Henry knew and so did his people. They were trying to destabilize the government by ousting the President. Their plan was that ‚ÄúA cornerstone will fall, and further destabilize the American people. First Nixon, now Clinton, thus the people will lose faith in their leaders and the democratic way of life. So they will want to change it and will lean toward World Order.‚Äù I knew in 1993, long before the Monica Lewinsky affair, that if Clinton was ousted, they had succeeded again in their plan and movement toward the New World Order.</p>
<p>I also had memories of experiences where I was at the White House with Hillary, Chelsea and a famous female vocalist, involved in a sex ritual.</p>
<p>In a society where mind control is insidious, the whole of society is responsible in some way, whether through ignorance, denial, spiritual disintegration or greed. To the extent that some of us are not free, none of us are free. I believe it is God‚Äôs perfect plan for those able persons to come to the aid of those who are in need.</p></p>

        <p><p>All of this is related to a decades old CIA program which created an army of mind controlled sex slaves to compromise politicians, businessmen, police, etc.  Research Operation Midnight Climax, etc.  </p>
<p>Or you can see all the information I've pulled together on my blog http://www.timeofreason.com/bill-hillary-clinton-weiner-epstein-the-tip-of-a-nightmare-cia-child-sex-ring-for-decades-index/  </p>
<p>Reading all of the posts will connect all the dots to what we are seeing in regards to Pizzagate.  </p></p>

<p>This is the reason why we all need to keep doing this, to keep digging, to keep resisting the MSM's fronts, to keep asking hard questions, to keep striving for honesty and truth and persevering, not get discouraged by false leads or failure to progress. Fighting is better than giving up or ignoring it, no matter the outcome. This is literally a battle of good vs. evil. For some reason or another those of us who are here have "awoken" to what's going on, and now it is our burden to keep investigating until we can save even one more child from these abominations. God do i sound dramatic but i have never felt more strongly that this is true.</p></p>

        <p><p>That's why I'm doing what I do.  There are, potentially, thousands of children in the US, who are subject to sexual abuse, torture and murder.  It's been covered up by those governing us.  We must not let it be done again.  </p>
<p>To those victims of MK Ultra, Project Monarch and hosts of other nefarious CIA programs, we remember you.  And, we will not let this be hidden any longer.</p>
<p>To those children who were victims of the Army's Presidio Daycare Sex Crimes, you are remembered.  We are furious that dozens of preschoolers who were diagnosed with STDs, never had any of the culprits convicted, including an Army Colonel who founded the Temple of Set, the Satanic church on Army bases.  </p>
<p>To those youth victimized in the Franklin Case, we hear your voices and are determined to seek justice.  Sadly, for some, it is to late.  Rest in peace Troy Boner.  </p>
<p>And, to individual children kidnapped by secret government operatives over the past 40 years, we will stop these crimes and throw out all who have upheld such, no matter their station.  </p>
<p>Thanks in particular, to a courageous Johnny Gosch, who secretly visited his mom, years after his kidnapping to tell her he couldn't come home.  He had been forced into a depraved program to corrupt politicians, and leaders of every stripe, by having sex with the target, while it was secretly recorded.  This provided blackmail material on everyone of note in the US.  Probably, even your local police chief.  Just ask Noreen Gosch.</p></p>

        <p><p>"Conspiracy theorists" have claimed all this since decades. Including Alex Jones and Inforwars. The very term "conspiracy theory" is a CIA propaganda term used to dissuade people from believing the truth and instead dismissing it as crazy.
The time has come we no longer use the term.</p></p>

But to be really pushed was in the time after 9/11 when the truth movement formed itsself questioning the official report.</p></p>

        <p><p>I watched a lecture she and her husband did on youtube a few days ago. They were recommending their new book, "Access Denied," and they warned that this book, "Trance Formation of America," is not really a narrative, but the testimony in court, etc. And that it contained some stuff that in retrospect they did not think was good for the public to be exposed to. Programming or something, I didn't quite catch it. </p>
<p>But their new book is their own story of exposing this and surviving and they said it was meant to be very healing for people who had been traumatized. I'm looking forward to reading it. I'm going to avoid "Trance Formation of America" as I don't want to exposed to the evil in it. I'll leave that up to less sensitive people. </p></p>

        <p><p>Not sure if this is the right thread for it, but this can be found in another book, "The Clintons War on Women" by Roger Stone and Robert Morrow:</p>
<p>Page 307 - 308 (Chapter 21, "The quotable Clintons")</p>
<p>"Pro-life activist Lurleen Stackhouse went to a pre-inauguration prayer service at the AME Church in Washington, DC, on January 21, 1993, a few hours before Bill was to be sworn in as president. After the service concluded, Lurleen gave her anti-abortion message to the Clintons. Stackhouse relayed the story to Washington Week:</p>
<p>When the service concluded we were asked to stay seated until the President and Mrs. Clinton departed for the White House. However, as they walked down the aisle I stood and reached out for Mr. Clinton. "Mr. Clinton, America must stop killing babies." He looked at me with a blank stare on his face. I repeated this statement to him.
Hillary (not hearing my comment) then came to give me a hug and I said (in a voice only audible to her), "Hillary, it is against God's law to kill babies." She stepped back, shaking and trembling, and then grabbed my arm. Her countenance transformed from a pleasant demeanor to the appearance of being possessed. Her eyes were enraged as (Hillary) replied,
"It is God's law to kill babies."
I drew back in shock at this blatant and revealing statement. I fully expected her to say, "It is God's law for women to hav a choice," or other pro-death rhetoric. But no, she was bold and blatant. I would not have believed it if I had not heard it with my own ears. I walked out with General Colin Powell. As the Clintons got into their limousine I approached the car. Through the glass I continued to plead with Mr. Clinton to stop killing babies. Again, he had a troubled stare."</p>
<p>When I read this story I thought it was about the abortion issue. After reading about Pizzagate, satanic rituals (and Moloch mentioned in an email), HRC's described demeanor and statement is now extremely troubling and scary to me.</p>
<p>(I am sorry that I don't have a link, I don't have access to a scanner right now either. I just wanted to post this before I forgot it since I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere. If someone owns the book and can scan the pages, I would be very grateful.)   </p></p>

        <p><p>I dunno - the crap was hidden for so so long. Leaving her alive would have previously been the better strategic move really. Cathy was saying high-up important people are criminals. If she wasn't a liar then you'd expect her to be silenced. She wasn't silenced, so she must be a liar to some degree. We have an insight into the whole situation from different angels now, and at least some of what Cathy is saying could (and seems to) be corroborated by the new info we have - the criminals couldn't have foreseen that. Killing her back then could have been a better choice if they expected to come this close to being outed, but hell for all we know they might get off on knowing these victims are out there being ignored..</p></p>

<p>Steven Greer talks about how the gov. stages UFO shit to make people sound crazy so that people aren't believed.</p></p>

        <p><p>Steven Greer is a clown. He says a lot of crazy shit to get people to buy his stuff. I've even read about him taking people out on excursions to contact aliens where mysteriously, nothing ever happens. Of course he charges them for this experience.</p></p>

        <p><p>She has scars on her genitals. </p>
<p>It is from her book documenting the abuse that she went through. https://www.amazon.com/Trance-Formation-America-Cathy-OBrien/dp/0966016548</p>
<p>She says it is being done to children because the trauma suspends their critical faculties, at which point they are susceptible to suggestions and changes to their core identity. </p>
<p>What she calls "mind control," is actually just hypnosis. But the trauma-based version of it seems to be like hypnosis on steroids. </p>
<p>The subject is literally displaced from their body and loses sense of time, space, and personal identity. </p>
<p>That is when the subject is ready to do the bidding of the person doing the "programming."</p>
<p>Much of the trauma is sexual, for the gratification of those inflicting it. This is why she is saying Hillary became excited to see her carved up vagina. </p>
<p>This is very real, and very distressing. </p></p>

        <p><p>Working on it right now as well. An online archive of the book for those interested: https://archive.org/stream/TranceformationOfAmerica/tranceformation_america_djvu.txt</p>
<p>She mentions a lot of wizard of oz "code words" in the book, and unfotunately a lot of those phrases have become synonymous with casual metaphors in conversations like "yellow brick road". Also looking a lot of the names mentioned in the book, not specifically the big politicians since they will of course pull up a lot of unrelated emails. Looking at names like special agents or doctors she mentions. Several so far and nothing. </p>
<p>This did lead me to search Wizard of Oz on wikileaks, led to this email, Podesta and his team keeping tabs with the conspiracies against him

        <p><p>I have been thinking about the CIA connection for a while now. In my view it's the point at which the Clintons lined themselves up for DC, via Mena Airport. I suspect the Mena connection is how they got insiders in DC via the CIA/Military Industrial Complex.</p>
<p>Now we are learning about the MKUltra pedo connection and it's tying in with Jeffrey Epstein and PizzaGate. Too many coincidences.</p></p>

        <p><p>Before you call me a shill - I do care deeply about this topic. I would never ever dismiss it. I care about it enough that I want to approach this content with caution - because if there is ever any disinfo it paints real survivors with the same brush. I am not sure Cathy is disinfo. I would guess that she has experienced this, but is being used as partial disinfo now. </p>
<p>Cathy may be telling the truth; but she and the guy she's with now are shady to the point I would call them disinfo - her current role in things is not clear cut. I would look at it critically while not becoming dismissive. Look up cathy obrien's husband - he is apparently "ex" CIA. </p></p>

        <p><p>Question:  If she's for real, and not a disinformation shill peddling lizard-people memes, why hasn't she been suicided?   I mean, I guess it's possible they haven't suicided her because the very fact that she talks about shape-shifting reptilians destroys her credibility, but if that's the case it also means maybe we shouldn't be promoting her.  We need to get the EVIDENCE out there.</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>We don't know that she was "carved up" at all.  We have no verification yet that the person in the video is an actual gynecologist, or that the vagina shown had been cut in any way, or that the image of a vagina shown is even of O'Brien.  Why did the video cut away? I raise these questions because CIA black psy-ops programs DO create disinformation like this to poison the well and make anyone raising these questions look like a fool.  O'Brien talking about "reptile holograms" is a red flag.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are you promoting?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm promoting we focus on spreading the best evidence we've collected, not get caught up in something that could be disinformation.  Whether she's for real or not, I have yet to see evidence to corroborate her story.     </p></p>

        <p><p>Good point. 
There are indeed false plants being put out to discredit. I've become aware of this myself. "Michelle Obama is a man" and "celebrities with lizzard eyes" videos are among them. 
Listening to this woman she does say some weird things. MK ultra victims might additionaly have difficulties discerning reality from fantasy as a result of their psychological harm. 
But a mutulated vagina is exactly that, so still hard evidence in a court case.
For believability they would have to be thouroughly interviewed and be able to give specific details they could otherwise not know.
I think she could be of interest in a court case, but might not be useful to us or to spread the information.</p></p>

        <p><p>Not all of it might be real; she might have regressed partly into a fantasy world as an escape mechanism, with her imagining it in her head and her fractured psyche remembering it as memories. There is no way to really know.</p></p>
