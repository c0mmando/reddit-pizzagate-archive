        <p><p>Holy shit. That has Mkultra and monarch programming all over it. The first few is showing turning a chunk of coal to a diamond. Seriously look at those and just interpret them as art. I think they really are stealing souls or bodies through some kind of ritual. Edit: She even references Marilon Monroe. Who was the first "diamond" mkultra victim</p></p>
