        <p><p>Right? Out of all of this, I have to say, I am really really disappointed at how stupid and entirely <em>uncool</em> all these people are.. I wanted them to have some secret knowledge, or at least be ideologically compelling, but they're idiots who feel like they're mystically better than others, and so look for "divine mandates". It's not much different in mechanism from a fat girl seeking out information that suggests that she's actually better for being fat. So disappointing. </p></p>

        <p><p>Recall that Amanda used the image in a video full of images of children. </p>
<p>You can see it in the screen captures here along with key questions (warning: discretion advised): http://imgur.com/a/uD0Uy</p>
<p>One of the fake shills here tried to make the excuse that Amanda was "joking" about playing in a pizza parlor. Um. It turns out that this isn't even an operational pizza parlor but an abandoned location covered with brush. Apparently Amanda and her shill didn't feel the need to tell us about this when they were "debunking."</p>
<p>There is also a river nearby, the whole location looks very remote. Here is a blog (innocent, unrelated to anything involving pizzagate) describing the area. Note the pictures and the feel of a remote location: https://positivelyptown.com/2010/10/26/towpath-park-where-canal-history-comes-alive/</p>
<p>What is significant about this abandoned location that Amanda put it in a video alongside pictures of small children and sexual references?</p>
<p>Have any of the "activities" occurred here? </p>
<p>Is it a meeting location, or something worse?</p>
<p>Have not looked into "pizza world," or its history and ownership, but for some reason Amanda thought it was worth including in her video next to children. Someone may want to conduct an investigation into its origins. The address is 724 and Peterman Road. Pottstown, PA.</p>
<p>Note as well that the latest video linked to Amanda again references pedophilia with infants and children dressed as (you guessed it) pizza. And the video shows images of hardcore pedophile Sathya Sai Baba.</p>
<p>Interestingly, on the same website is an event called "Baba's mountain" (i.e. pedophile's mountain) where youth are invited to "see for yourself."</p>
<p>The illustration of this event shows minors surrounded by trees and brush in some kind of remote location, with two adult figures dressed in ritual garments. </p>
<p>You can watch the full video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_gGhrIO6ps&amp;t=1m49s - listen carefully for ambiguity in meaning, themes involving payment and transportation, locations in Washington DC, NLP-like vocal emphasis and intonations pertaining to sexual themes like "filling holes," "virgin," and so forth.</p>
<p>For reference: </p>
<p>Here is the thread documenting the pedophilia/pizza references that Amanda makes: https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dar01/reply_to_amanda_kleinman_empirically_verifiable/</p>
<p>Here is the thread detailing an updated expanded record of pedophilia references in a video she failed to tell people about, including "Baba's Mountain": https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dkup9/a_chilling_video_with_sexual_torture_infants/</p>
<p>Note Podesta (friends with Comet Ping Pong's Alefantis) has devoted his home as a "shrine" to imagery from Biljana Djurdjevic.</p>
<p>Interestingly, she paints many realistic scenes of minors being led into heavy shrubs or forests in a remote location, some of them are also dead and floating in a river or lake:
http://www.biljanadjurdjevic.com/HotBed.html</p>
<p>My own take is that these people seem to be making inside references to where some of the activity occurs, and potentially to locations where they hide some of the deceased victims. Not saying anything for sure, just very odd that these abandoned locations, forests and rivers along with "pizza" keep showing up as recurring themes. </p></p>

        <p><p>"Puppet" is the name she gave her post-trauma personality fracture. I know it's true, because my fracture's name is Dust (who, just saying, isn't a pussy like Puppet. Dust will fight), and I have an ex who had one named "broom stick". It's such a common but unspoken thing among victims of childhood sexual trauma.. Sometimes I wonder if the creator of Adventure Time was abused, because B-MO has a fracture named "football" that functions a lot like a real one. </p></p>

        <p><p>Sometimes people break into parts to save the trauma from happening to the "real" you, like letting some character become you and feel the pain so that you can not. It usually happens early in life and so the names people give their fractures are usually simple things like puppet or Dust or frisbee. It's just a way to not experience the trauma. That in no way excuses Kleinman. </p></p>

        <p><p>Don't forget about Ping Pong's picture of a guy playing ping pong with an alien. 3 fingers and 4'2" sounds like a grey to me. I know they will dress up to abuse children in order to hide their identity and increase the trauma. Maybe they dress up like aliens? In the video I posted in a thread I did about Carlos Slim, the girl is talking about Mickey Mouse, which means that she most likely saw someone in costume, so now it just seems as though she's crazy to anyone who isn't aware of SRA. But, one of Carlos Slim's contact goes by the nickname Mickey, so maybe this is the character he chooses to be when he's abusing the kids. </p></p>

        <p><p>This video makes my skin crawl.  I know a lot of avante garde artists, and their stuff is a bit out there, but it's still art.  This is NOT art.  This is pedophelia culture kitsch, that only pedophiles and occultists could enjoy.  I can only imagine the kind of videos she made for Alefantis and friends that are not posted on Youtube.  You were dead right in your assertions.  </p></p>

        <p><p>the image of MA with the children is from Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens, intersting enough abook/ play/moive about a workhouse for orfaned children, where plenty of abuses took place in London. 
Or as the guardian paper uk named it. "A novel insight into child abuse " https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/nov/30/childrensservices. IM sorry but with messages like this in thier music, I wouldnt want my kids anywhere near this women, evidence or not. !!!</p>
<p>hahah innit funny this hipster art!</p></p>

        <p><p>If Amanda Klienman wasn't associated with Comet Ping Pong, I'd think nothing of it.  Since Amanda Kleinman is associated with Comet Ping Pong, and in a huge way, I think EVERYTHING of it.  </p>
<p>She's putting that shot in there to show what really happens at their "Pizza events".  </p></p>

        <p><p>This now makes 2 creepy pizza places that are on top of a tunnel that Amanda Kleinman is connected to. When will this get investigated? This is getting to be overkill. Quit trying to cover the shit up. Do the right thing and look into some of this for christs sake!! </p></p>

<p>Social Media Logo Placement
The spiral logo seems to be intentionally highlighted here. I've never seen a company do this is such an odd display. It seems unnecessary.

        <p><p>Interestingly in 2002 Congress was discussing a 1.4 Trillion dollar grant to have underground metro stretching from Philadelphia to Reading. Running parallel with 724 through the Pottstown area. This puts pizza world uncomfortably close to an underground transit plan that was manifested in 2002. On the US GOV'T website. Would be a great location to offload a railcar. Nuts. https://www.congress.gov/107/crpt/srpt38/CRPT-107srpt38.pdf</p></p>
