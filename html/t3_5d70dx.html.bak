        <strong>Why haven't Alex Jones or Jesse Ventura even mentioned this yet?</strong>
        <p><p>The media silence has been deafening, but they (and similar personalities) are the key to getting this story to audiences that don't crawl the Internet for information. </p>
<p>What can we do to let them know to investigate?</p></p>

        <p><p>His video on this has almost a million views, he starts crying and talking about how he knew all along... but I think he's just keeping quiet now because it's clear this is being covered up until Jan 20th to allow for the peaceful transition of power. That's how it seems to me. If this got leaked today to the general public, I don't even know what the reaction would be. Sort of like 9/11 to be honest...</p></p>

        <p><p>Alex jones seems to have a lot of mixed feelings on this sub. I actually brought up the same question about Jesse Ventura earlier today. Im a big fan of his, so naturally I'm surprised as well. He's objective and level-headed, qualities this sub seems to appreciate. Perhaps we should post some of his stuff? I honestly believe he's a friend to the truth movement. </p>
<p>This was evident in his defamation case against the Kyle estate (he was smeared as a result) He offered to drop the case multiple times if the publisher removed the false story from Kyle's book and issued a retraction. They refused, and Ventura won the lawsuit (it was pointed out that because of his celebrity status it would be nearly impossible for him to win unless he could offer irrefutable proof the story was a fabrication.)</p></p>

        <p><p>Haven't seen this, thanks for sharing.</p>
<p>This video was from November 5th though, since then a lot has emerged and I don't think he's even mentioned a thing. He needs to follow up.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think once bigger substantial leads come out it will be covered more. Theres a mass spike in interest lately so hopefully that results into more ppl helping.</p></p>

<p>Trump is connected to PizzaGate through Epstein the convicted child molester.</p>

        <p><p>I believe Trump said once that Epstein has a good taste in girls even if a little young. I think Trump went to Epsteins island once where he allegedly takes his super rich friends for sexual parties and also some paedophilia. Trump never went there again.</p>
<p>The Clintons have also been there. Check out Epsteins private jet called "The Lolita Express".</p></p>
