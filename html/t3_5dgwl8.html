        <p><p>I think it's to show her supporters how "broken" she is from losing to donald. She wants her supporters to riot and be mad. She's just not wearing make-up to make it seem like she's exhausted. Also that bullshit about her wanting to stay in bed is just to trigger her feminist supporters</p></p>

        <p><p>she just wrapped up a year+ long ridiculous campaign and lost. I am not at all surprised to see here completely run down. Do I think that discredits any of the info here, no, but I think its unrelated. </p></p>

        <p><p>Do you have any idea how exhausting a presidential election campaign is? How many miles traveled. Numerous flights in a day. Time zones traversed. Meetings attended. Speeches given. Little time to unwind or recharge. Now imagine you did all of that to achieve one preeminent goal... and you fail. </p>
<p>I'm very physically active and in great health but still hate flying anywhere (even for pleasure, nevermind work) because it throws everything off. Name one person that wouldn't succomb to the election grind to at least some degree...</p>
<p>I personally believe she is very sick. And if so, it's incredible to me that she's even alive after this campaign. I'd fucking retire forever. </p></p>

        <p><p>The low lighting and makeup convince me this is intentional. I don't think she's trying to make her supporters angry I think she's trying to be pitied in advance of further investigations.</p>
<p>The MSM and the left will paint her as a victim and the investigation as heartless.</p></p>

        <p><p>If intentional it does a disservice to good women everywhere and everywhen. Now people will say, "See, if she can't handle this stress how could she handle a national crisis."  Pathetic. Has any male candidate ever looked that devastated?  I'm glad I have good examples of great women in my life that I greater admire and respect. So glad Hillary will never be the one answering The Phone. </p></p>
