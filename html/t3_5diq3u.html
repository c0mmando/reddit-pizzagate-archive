        <p><p>Thanks for getting the word out. We are trying to make this more clear to people (although it is in the rules already).</p>
<p>To be clear everyone: we have removed a couple of posts (including several excellent ones by /u/BaconChapstick ) because of reddit TOS. We are working to built an off-reddit solution to exchanging some of this information.</p></p>

        <p><p>My other account with tons of information got banned from here, they couldn't even reference a rule I broke, I hadn't posted anyone's public information either. I've had probably around 100 posts/comments get deleted. Whenever something is pretty juicy and we're heading in the right direction, someone at the server level delete's it.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, we are. The Ztec.io thread had new accounts shilling for how they 100% believe that new narrative that it's all a coincidence. Suddenly a couple hours after that thread went up that new moderator with Full Permissions is added. It's extremely obvious this subreddit is compromised.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's definitely suspicious. Majorly suspicious actually. Could you give me a summary of the z-tec.io relation (who is z-tec and how and all that jazz)? I've been at work all day and our office has 4/8chan blocked so I can't keep up with what's going on over there until I leave or view on my phone.</p>
<p>TIA</p></p>

        <p><p>We've been messaged expressing concern that only /u/IncreasinglyAlarmed was given an explanation.</p>
<p>Explanation: We want to create new accounts which don't have as much PII. Basic opsec. Some of the mods are using older burner accounts and we want them to be able to protect themselves. Come chat off reddit. Most of the mods are on matrix. Come <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#pizzagate:matrix.org">into the reception room and have a chat</a></p>
<p>In the meantime I'm locking this. We honestly appreciate that we are being held accountable. Any further discussion about moderation or censorship needs to point to examples.</p></p>

<p>The sub is not compromised. You guys are over reacting. The moderators I have put in place can be trusted. They have been doing a fantastic job. New mods are either alts or wikimods only.</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>/pol/ alleges it's related to z-tec.io</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not an argument.</p>
<p>And do we have any proof relating to z-tec.io that doesn't depend on gematria? If you find some I welcome anyone to provide it and post a topic on it.</p></p>

Anyone is welcome to message the mods about any concerns. We want to address them but without causing panic which will disrupt what organization we have managed to create.</p></p>
