        <strong>Revisiting - Hawaiian Vodka Company</strong>
        <p><p>This was the string of connections that convinced me. I haven't seen it in over a week.

Do not let this slip. <a href="https://sli.mg/a/hhe7CP">https://sli.mg/a/hhe7CP</a> </p></p>

        <p><p>Any chance the Vodka is actually some kind of acid for dissolving bodies?</p></p>

        <p><p>The guy who was at the place, checking the 30 wifi signals out, actually didn't come back with further evidence. This is what i read in the thread on 4chan. </p></p>

        <p><p>I had read that he just came to share his story. They verified that his original posts were legitimate. Not really necessary to come back with more evidence when your first post a long with your photos are already a treasure trove. </p></p>

        <p><p>I dont see any clear evidence of anything illegal happening at that place. Correct me with real evidence and not speculation, then I will believe you. </p></p>
