        <strong>Should we try and make #pedosta trend?</strong>
        <p><p>Would #pedosta be vulnerable to libel charges?</p>
<p>I know he isn't the only culprit but it is mostly due to his emails that widespread investigation has reached it's current point.</p>
<p>This needs to be more widespread than some subreddits or fringe conspiracy sites.</p>
<p>I have a large amount compiled on my facebook that I am going to continue to share but I want to have a hashtag for it to share again later today.</p></p>

        <p><p>No, it's bigger than podesta. This is international child trafficing (potentially).</p></p>

        <p><p>Also pizzagate is terrible and is being mocked. We need a name that will appeal to the hearts of everyone. This is about saving children.</p></p>
