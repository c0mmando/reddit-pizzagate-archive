        <strong>Stop letting them distract you! No more wasting time on the 2GB CP threads.</strong>
        <p><p>Many of us have been following these threads since this morning. I personally have, and I've spent (cough, wasted) a hell of a lot of time doing it with no positive results. There are many inconsistencies with what the "hackers" claim to have found, how they found it, and they seem to have an inability to provide ANY shred of legitimate proof to verify the claims they are making. While we are all hoping for that smoking gun we need, we all need to accept that this might not be it.  The OP of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dykv3/i_have_cracked_into_an_unidentified_pizza/">1st thread</a> had said that we will hear about this in the news tomorrow - I suppose that is really the only evidence we have left to hope for regarding this matter, since the OPs of those threads aren't providing any of the supposed "spreadsheets" that they found either. They claimed to have found a pricing list, but where the fuck is it? Why did they have so much time to keep posting comments and starting threads, but still didn't manage to even post a damn pdf or excel file? In the meantime I think we should all stop putting our intellectual resources and emotions into these guys unless we see something legitimate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get back to digging our other leads, or take a break if you are overwhelmed from today. We DID make some interesting connections with the WTP restaurant that we can start looking into further, despite the likely possibility of the 2GB threads being a sham. Do not keep getting distracted by the 2GB threads until we have solid proof. If this is indeed a sham, you have to wonder... what are they trying to distract us from? </p>

        <p><p>You are correct... I always get suspicious when someone is very very insistent that I don't investigate an issue further... why would anyone care what I do with my own time? Russian nesting dolls of distractions... Everyone just get back to nailing Podesta... who surely hasn't been in FBI custody since election night. </p></p>

        <p><p>Spot on.    Which means there is evidence here somewhere in this haystack that is legitimate.   </p>
<p>Why else would a shill post CP to the sub?</p>
<p>Sounds like a great way to get lots of evidence deleted.</p></p>

        <p><p>They posted again, stating that they will dump everything they have. Probably a trick, but hang in there one last time, says that it's his last post.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not trying to be rude man, but think logically here.    </p>
<p>This would literally be one of the biggest stories ever in the United States.    If you found out people with this kind of power were doing something like this , would reddit be the first place you went ???  </p></p>
