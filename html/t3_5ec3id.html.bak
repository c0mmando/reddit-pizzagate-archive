<blockquote>
<p>d in April 2009 on one count of felony possession. Lawyers for the State Bar of California contended Grant's conduct is so morally reprehensible that he and other lawyers convicted of such a crime should be automatically disqualified from practicing law. Grant argued the crime isn't as bad as the bar says it is, because he didn't seek out two pornographic images depicting minors that were found on his computer. When he saw them, he said he deleted them.</p>
<p>Authorities found more than 300,000 images of adult pornography on his computers. During that time, Grant received two unsolicited emails containing sexual depictions of minors, court records show. He said he “instantly” deleted them.</p>

        <p><p>Lack of resources? WTF! All of the people involved <em>paid</em> for child porn. ALL of them <em>paid</em> for it. Turn the evidence over to other agencies if necessary!</p></p>
