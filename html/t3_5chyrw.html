        <strong>This is How We Win</strong>
        <p><p>By my review of social media analytics, 500,000+ people (conservatively) are now taking all of this deadly seriously, from many different continents. </p>
<p>We can plausibly assume that, of those 500,000, many more are digging on their own, and many are spreading the information even further. </p>
<p>That is social media analytics alone - it doesn't include many alternative media outlets curating the info on their own domains. </p>
<p>We have now crossed an important threshold: it is no longer an option for these people to just suicide anyone who knows. Each day, the number of people who know and whose curiosity gets the best of them is growing exponentially. It is unstoppable now, and the momentum is approaching virility. </p>
<p>The only way to put this back into the bag would be a catastrophe that sufficiently disrupts large portions of the Internet. </p>
<p>I do not think that option is available to them anymore (or, at least, we had better hope not).</p>
<p>Note on going forward: </p>
<p>Remember, you are not crazy. This is all real. And we don't have time for fear anymore. </p>
<p>We need about another 5-7 days of hammering this information out into more populated social media channels. By then, or even sooner, this will be huge news. </p>
<p>Get the most plausible items of interest out into social media networks. For the items that still need more investigation, save those for in-house investigation. </p>
<p>In my estimation, we have already won the key battle: the battle of getting the general idea out and building the momentum into something that is about to achieve virility. </p></p>

        <p><p>I'm with you. Fuck that other guy. There are far too many "coincidences". I've gotten a few close friends on the same page. This is gaining steam. In the past, this was easy to cover up because the main source of public information was exclusively the media. The internet has the reach, and we're getting close to a significant breakthrough in awareness.</p></p>

        <p><p>We're getting close is right.  I'm on your team too man.  I highly encourage everyone with the stomach to keep digging to do so.  Maybe NYPD/WIKILEAKS has nothing and maybe the true smoking gun is hidden in front of our faces.  I'm not a deniar, I just don't think anything out right now would put these fucks behind bars.  Hopefully someone is doing some serious underground sleuthing and infiltrating this secret society.  The point remains though, at this time, we don't have anything except super fucky circumstances. </p></p>

        <p><p>Please, people. Call it #Pedosta: it will get people talking. You can bring it up in conversation. People recognize the name and will say, "huh, wasn't that guy's named Podesta?" You can then say, "No, look it up. #Pedosta".</p>
<p>PizzaGate just makes you sound silly. This bigger than Watergate (hence, no Pedostagate) </p>
<h1>Pedosta is how it ends.</h1>
<p>Edit: 'Pedostagate' comes too close to 'stargate'. </p></p>

        <p><p>These coincidences do not just happen. If there is nothing to hide, why are so many people trying to dismiss it, cover it up, or dilute the connections. </p>
<p>We know there are communities where incredibly brazen criminal corruption, racketeering and other crimes are committed without any consequence. We know that the FBI and DOJ are completely aware and complicit to it, and we know that powerful people are trying to cover it up. </p>
<p>Everything is connected. Keep digging. The truth is the only justice people have without the rule of law, and there is little faith that Trump is smart or powerful enough to truly change anything unless his hand is forced by the undeniable truths that come to light. One has to wonder if Trump was pushed over the top by the very people involved, as they knew that Hillary being in office for 4-8 years would have opened Pandora's box. Have you ever watched a magic show? </p>
<p>Regular people are the only chance our world has of saving itself. There is power in numbers and power in the truth. Information is the new currency. </p></p>

        <p><p>I've thought about that too.  Is he a part of this too?  Certainly could be, but not nearly as much proof as Hillary.  Regardless of the truth, this needs brought to light for these kids involved.  On that topic, someone (red-pill) at work and asked where are they getting all these kids?  I didn't know what to tell him.  I know plane flights have been suggested, but it's there more concrete stuff on where these kids are coming from? Any suggestions for me to read up on that?</p></p>

        <p><p>You know what scares me. Everyone who took the time to check my summary of the facts says: "I know it all along". Still waiting for the first person to debunk this shit.</p>
<p>Maybe important to note that I live in Belgium and we had a very similar case: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Dutroux</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A number of shortcomings in the Dutroux investigation caused widespread discontent in Belgium with the country's criminal justice system, and the ensuing scandal was one of the reasons for the reorganisation of Belgium's law enforcement agencies.
Allegations of cover-up[edit] There was widespread anger and frustration among Belgians due to police errors, the general slowness of the investigation and the disastrous outcome of the events. This suspicion that Dutroux had been, or was being, protected was raised when the public became aware of Dutroux's claims that he was part of a sex ring that included high-ranking members of the police force and government.[14] This suspicion, along with general anger over the outcome, culminated with the popular judge in charge of investigating the claims, Jean-Marc Connerotte (fr), being dismissed on the grounds of having participated in a fund-raising dinner for the girls' parents.[14] The investigation itself was wrapped up on the grounds of conflict of interest. His dismissal and the end of the investigation resulted in a massive protest march (the "White March") of 300,000 people on the capital, Brussels, in October 1996, two months after Dutroux's arrest, in which demands were made for reforms of Belgium's police and justice system.[15] <strong>On the witness stand, Jean-Marc Connerotte (fr), the original judge of the case, broke down in tears when he described "the bullet-proof vehicles and armed guards needed to protect him against the shadowy figures determined to stop the full truth coming out.[14] Never before in Belgium has an investigating judge at the service of the king been subjected to such pressure. We were told by police that [murder] contracts had been taken out against the magistrates." Connerotte testified that the investigation was seriously hampered by protection of suspects by people in the government. "Rarely has so much energy been spent opposing an inquiry," he said. He believed that the Mafia had taken control of the case.</strong>[16]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of going out and protesting after everything is said and done I choose to help the investigation and making people aware of the facts.</p>
<p>Still hoping this is not true, but it seems less likely every day. </p></p>

        <p><p>Until some real evidence is uncovered, nothing of importance will happen. We haven't won shit. Unless wikileaks drops some serious bombs/leads, this probably isn't going anywhere. What if this is a sting operation and now its fucked up? what if you ruined people's reputations/livelihoods based on weak, circumstantial evidence? Seriously, most of the shit posted here is laughable. It wouldn't surprise me if sex trafficking/pedo is going on, but you literally have nothing definitive. And before you tell me to go read the evidence, I have. And now here comes the "hur dur go away ctr shill". </p></p>

        <p><p>Nah man, I agree too.  Everything can be chalked up to a coincidence.  A HUGE coincidence, but nothing locked in full-on proof.  I believe NYPD or WikiLeaks has more information.  I hope they choose to do the right thing with this information and not bury it.  But again, all these links seem obvious to those digging around, but to someone who has heard ZERO about this sounds like the craziest conspiracy theory of them all. </p></p>

        <p><p>You need to understand that this sort of thing attracts conspiracy theorists, i.e people who believe the moon landing was a hoax, who believe hillary clinton is a reptile, and that Illuminati is controlling the world. Those are the kind of people who believe you are a "shill" if you're skeptical, or that draws ridiculous conclusions from nothing and ties in other conspiracy theories in this.</p>
<p>My personal stance - and I've never ever been into conspiracy theories - is as follows:</p>
<p>This case piqued my interest because there's a lot of weird stuff going on. Thats all there is right now, a lot of weird stuff that I don't know what to make of. Our only true source of information is the emails from WikiLeaks and some of the connections people on here have been able to make. What makes this a case is that the emails are so god damned strange. </p>
<p>I believe that there is definitely pedo rings out there. A global one? Pretty likely, especially considering many people have mentioned it. Satanic? Eh, less likely but still a lot of people have mentioned it. A global, satanic pedo ring with a lot of high ranking officials involved? Now we're getting really fucking crazy, and I personally don't think thats whats going on here. But then again, thats what makes this exciting - what if? </p>
<p>But the reality is that we are 100% dependent on WikiLeaks to come with more information. As of now, what we have and what we are likely to find, will never amount to anything. In a couple of weeks, this sub will probably die down and all but the most hardcore conspiracy theorists will have forgotten about it - UNLESS WikiLeaks can drop some more stuff.</p>
<p>Because don't get me wrong, there is a lot of strange things going on, and I would love to keep the pressure up so we perhaps could get some answers. If it did go public, I am sure news outlets etc would pressure some kind of information out of people. Maybe a statement from someone involved etc. That in itself would be pretty exciting.</p></p>

        <p><p>Me too man.  Not a shill, I voted Trump and here because this shit boggles my mind.  As it stands, it's weird code words and very compelling links to some very VIP people, but nothing that will lead to a conviction.  Like I said before, if the FBI/NYPD/Wikileaks has more proof, maybe they are actually building a case as we speak.  I want Trey Gowdy to be the next fucking president! </p></p>

        <p><p>Agreed 100%.  But making this go viral will put pressure on folks to potentially investigate.  Then maybe they find some hard evidence.</p></p>

        <p><p>How many 'pizza parties' are in pedostas emails? Spanning how many years? So everyone caught in the comet pizza 'sting' has what, been secretly arrested and held without trial? All these political party members are part of an undercover operation? Someone signed off on letting these horrible acts occur for years because they haven't caught the big boys yet?</p></p>

        <p><p>It's bigger than Podesta. This is human trafficing on a huge international scale.</p>
<p>How about something on an emotional level to raise attention and hope, such as WIKI KIDS? It needs to be non-politial and something to show we really care first and formost for the childred.</p></p>

        <p><p>It shoud be focused on the fact we're first and formost trying to SAVE children. It should be non-politional and not tin foul hat sounding. The media have already joked about the pizza references. It's WAY more than this now.</p>

        <p><p>Keep digging, guys!</p>
<p>Interesting that a few days before the election there were even posters on /r/the_donald trying to talk people out of looking into the pedo connections.  This despite the fact that FBI Anon specifically mentioned these connections numerous times.</p>
<p>Keep digging, no matter what they say.  Do not give up, even if the FBI / DOJ end up dropping it.  Expose them all and make life a living hell for them.</p>
<p>Call it #Pedosta.</p></p>
