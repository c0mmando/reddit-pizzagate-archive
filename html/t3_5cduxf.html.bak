        <p><p>Going to copy this comment from another post here as I think it is pertinent.</p>
<p>I'm not a religious man, I'm not a supernatural believer, I'm not very trusting, I'm not one to believe in conspiracy theories that are far out.</p>
<p>However I am one that understands that evil in this world exists and in ways that I could never even fathom. I also understand that just because something sounds outrageous. (One of the things for me, a place like heaven after I die.) I still don't discredit it and write it off, because the absolute truth is that I DONT KNOW and NO ONE has ever truly known.</p>
<p>I think that applies here to a degree considering the amount of smoke billowing out at this point. Do I believe all of this is true? Unlikely, for instance the Obama flying in pizza and hot dogs thing, probably Occam's Razor should apply.</p>
<p>However, there is no denying, once you look through the information at hand that something is off. I mean just the sheer amount of affiliations with known pedo's in this social circle is a cause to be weary. These are actual people that have confessed or were in imprisoned. Solid facts. That are associated with names mentioned throughout.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, how many pedo's do you know or have you known in your social circle throughout your life? Me? None.</p>
<p>Its disconcerting at the least and at the most does call for an discerning eye to sift through and ensure there isn't cause for alarm.</p>
<p>Another thing I'd like to add, and you may judge, is that I did not vote in this election, didn't even pay attention to politics at all. Hell I was watching impressions last night and saw some of Trump and thought, well, I don't know that one because I havn't really watched him speak.</p>
<p>I know, I'm a poor citizen of America for not caring. My point being that I in no way have an agenda for Trump in reference to this scandal. I could give a f about him. I do care about childrens lives, and the evil that can destroy them.</p>
<p>I say all this, and bare with me as I know it sounds cookoo, but is legitimate because think about how they would react if this were true. If there was a higher level/political ring of sorts that was involved in something so Diabolical.</p>
<p>If that were true, then right now there best bet would to make sure that anyone investigating was deemed a "Conspiracy Nut". I mean wouldn't that be the most effective way of dousing the flames. Delete pics, delete weird stuff, hire a few online trolls to get on sites like Reddit and 4chan, where this stuff is breaking, and completely discredit them.</p>
<p>A person going through may be thinking, wow, this actually has some pretty disturbing warning signs. This may need to be investigated. But then read a comment like some on this page and remember, "Oh silly, c'mon, shit like this doesn't happen, look at you being so foolish and thinking something so evil like this could happen."</p>
<p>Evil happens. True evil.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is real, I hope, hope hope, it is not. But, IF IT IS. Just what if it is? We must do something about it. The only way we could something about it is by the general populace accepting it, allowing folks like the FBI to investigate and have the publics support, because without OUR support? Well anyone could scrub off a lone conspiracy nut.</p>
<p>In conclusion, be semi-open minded with a scrutiness eye.</p>
<p>Be weary that people are hired to post "troll" comments on forums to swing opinions.</p>
<p>Lastly, do not doubt the evil in this world, but also do not doubt the good.</p></p>

<p>Lol. You know you're enlightened when you realize the fbi is part of the problem. Evil is old as the old religion. And the old religion has many names. This planet needs to wake up. Let me ask you something: Where do you think all those missing people go? Do you think it's a few isolated cases? Well it's not. This is organized and old as the hills. This is a rare moment in history where humanity has three things: the first and second amendments and the age of information. This opportunity won't last long, unless we act wisely as our founding forefathers who rebelled against the same tyranny. People, We must use our time wisely, if we are to save our planet's freedom. Much love, no fear.</p></p>

        <p><p>Dude I was in another thread and I hate to see people saying: "yeah so they have no evidence just a bunch of 4chan users overthinking"...</p>
<p>they got upvoted and people saying that this is more than coincidences are getting downvoted.</p>
<p>Fuck that man, makes me feel so weird.</p>
<p>I did an similar investigation in university but about my country (México), they did THE SAME THING.</p>
<p>Just it wasn't pizza, they called the kids "wine", and the audios are one of the most disgusting things I've ever heard.</p>
<p>I still feel a little uncomfortable when someone mentions an 12 year old wine because I remember those nasty recordings.</p></p>

        <p><p>its denial.  if this CP shit is as widespread as it seems, our collective sense of decency will require a revolution.  At the very least, no one of good conscience will be able to continue blindly accepting whatever "authority" claims is truth.</p></p>

        <p><p>Because it's easier to write us off as conspiracy theorists. No one wants to believe this shit is true. The blue pill is always easier and they know that. They know this will get written off as nut-baggery. </p></p>

<p>I cant wrap my head around this right now. </p>
<p>Part of me is happy Ive seen this and part of me wishes I never had.  I've been thinking about it all night.  This is the craziest shit I've ever seen. </p>

        <p><p>It is indeed frightening. </p>
<p>The CPP Instagram was the tipping point for me.  Those comments on some of the pictures. It was incriminating to say the least.  </p></p>

        <p><p>I've been avoiding pictures like the plague and just reading people's accounts and research. This stuff messes with my head too much. All the shit around the election has been so mentally taxing and now this shit, I've always said I wanted the establishment to be revealed for what it is but I guess I never imaged it'd be as truly fucked up as the conspiracies said.</p></p>

        <p><p>Could you provide a description of the artwork? I've been glued to this case, but I haven't opened any links of images like this or watched the YouTube videos people have posted because I'm afraid that actually seeing the images will be triggering.</p>
<p>I know it's not ideal for me to follow this sub's work as much as I am since I still dissociate, but I am so concerned for these children that I wouldn't feel right turning my back on this and pretending it's not happening. My strategy of only reading the text-based posts is a sort of "compromise" aimed at minimizing the amount that I get triggered. To other posters reading this- I would be grateful if people gave brief descriptions of the pictures and images posted. Many of them have descriptions like "this is weird", but I don't feel safe to click on any of them so I don't know what people have found. I know this might seem bizarre, dramatic, or even too demanding of a request, but I couldn't work for the rest of the day after seeing the images of Epstein's temple- and that only even have any people in it!</p></p>

        <p><p>not a problem...I totally understand. and thanks for being here despite the triggers you may encounter</p>
<p>there is a square table with 2 children laying on each end - legs draped over the side.. 2 adults stand in front of the children, one in a sexual stance....another adult is watching from the middle of the table like a referee. the adults are ginning.   above both children are what seems to be their spirits floating up/or a metaphor for disassociation.</p>
<p>the art is done in a colorful childish block style - very little detail mostly shapes</p></p>

        <p><p>Wtf. Thanks for the description. By "linked to comet", do you mean they had this as art on their walls, or has someone been able to make a connection that she was a victim there? </p>
<p>I get tears in my eyes at the magnitude of this and at wondering how many thousands of people are there and have there been. One child is too many. 100 would seem obscene. But thousands is an unfathomable level of evil. </p></p>

        <p><p>it was said before that either some of the therapy art hung on the walls at Comet and was found on their instagram, and/or was used as a poster for a show there. I have not been able to verify it though TBH - she has no involvement in Comet at all.</p>
<p>the correlation I saw was that this act may be generally known to pedos as "ping pong"   I am not sure about it...but that certainly looks like it by the way they refer to it in code       </p>
<p>she had also painted child figures hanging from a single rope that went from behind - under their arms across their chest.....Tony Podesta had child torture art with the exact same bondage used.   so there is that connection as well</p>
<p>(here is a post from earlier about that - but warning you may be triggered)

        <p><p>Thanks. At what point does someone's "art" count as probable cause? Just the fact that the word "child" and "bondage" were used in the same sentence is enough to make me condemn it without even needing to see it. Is said torture art the same art from an interview I saw describes where he has art in his bedroom and his wife was smiling about how it makes people uncomfortable? </p></p>

        <p><p>the real question is why does someone like Tony Podesta collect this type of art AT ALL?   he has a whole collection of shit like that....very disturbing.   pretty sure it was that same art piece of the girls tied up they were referring to.    sick what they can get away with under the guise of "art"</p></p>
