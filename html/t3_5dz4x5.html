        <strong>Please assist the moderators in developing a clear-cut list of rules for the good of the sub!</strong>
        <p><p>Some ideas are:  </p>
<p>Absolutely no caps. Ever. I'm sick of this.  </p>
<p>No suggesting we "hack" or "raid" anything as a group. This is not /pol.  </p>
<p>If you feel like you have something good but are worried about the legality of say, posting the data you just found please, please ask a mod what to do first...  </p>
<p>Etc. </p></p>

        <p><p>I think there should be mention somewhere telling users to refrain from suggesting that being gay or being a democrat is explicitly connected with being a child molester. There is quite a bit of that happening here, and thus far, that has literally been the one and only thing MSM has used to discredit us and label our investigation as "crazy redneck alt-right conspiracies" to dismiss it. </p></p>

        <p><p>If you feel this is an issue we will look into it. We do not want anyone to be dis-respected based on their personal beliefs/sexuality. This is expressly stated in the sub-reddit posting rules.</p></p>

        <p><p>Sorry, I stupidly didn't click the existing rules before that comment. It's less about individual's feeling disrespected and more about TPTB using the instance of individual's feelings being disrespected as ammo to weaken our claims.</p></p>

        <p><p>The charge against Democrats is easily countered by pointing out that a whole lot of Republicans have also been accused by many victims. We should make a list. It seems to be a completely bi-partisan problem. </p></p>

        <p><p>I've been here from the beginning, trying to get modding permissions. Heres some ideas:</p>
<p>No fucking MEMES, Music videos, FACEBOOK links to a restaurant (pizzeria, band, etc) </p>
<p>Anything posted needs to have evidence presented..NO WILD ACCUSATIONS</p>
<p>The SATANIC/RELIGIOUS aspect needs to take a backseat and stay away from the main focus. SO MANY GARBAGE THREADS ON THIS SHIT</p>
<p>Anything that makes this political, left vs right...basically bullshit to distract us from the main cause</p>
<p>I think it would also be a good idea for people starting a new thread with new evidence to link the previous thread it came from...kinda keep a web going so people can follow the new evidence</p></p>

        <p><p>can we please have rules against people arguing this is BS?
clearly many of us dont think so. we are investigating &amp; spreading what knowledge we do find - it is up to the police to see this and make conclusions. at this point all of us have seen enough to warrant further effort in spreading this message. wasting valuable time arguing with JTRIG is hurting the process. </p>
<p>so yeah, it might seem like censorship but this isnt really a debate sub where we are debating if it is fked up or not. we are here to investigate &amp; link.</p></p>
