        <strong>Giving back to pizzagate</strong>
        <p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Website is up! http://pizzagate.host/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to give back to both the Reddit community AND /r/pizzagate so I have purchased pizzagate.host. I will begin hosting a phpBB system and I would encourage those to create an account and use it as backup. I am on a cheap hosting plan but will eventually add cloudflare along with unlimited bandwith (only 100GB per month right now.) It is DDOS protected. Nudity will NOT be allowed OR tolerated. I feel like this may be a better way for you to post pizzagate related topics along with more permanent and unbiased storage for your pictures and links.</p></p>

        <p><p>Doing things like this seems like a good idea at first, but it's probably not best to sacrifice utilizing multiple platforms. It'd be shitty if we were all in the same place posting to the same forum. We'd be much easier to take out.</p>
<p>However, if people opt to do this, we're sadly going to have to dox the fuck out of whoever the one hosting the site is. We can't take any chances, and if it were you, you'd need to be perfectly fine with that happening regardless of whether or not it's something you're willing to agree to upfront.</p></p>

        <p><p>If it came to that I suppose so. My name provider has Whois guard so it would be a bit difficult. I'm hoping people would utilize this. I only spent about $3 on getting it started so honestly it's not that much if no one doesn't use it. But if it has the ability to help collect evidence and allow for clear navigation and easy to use access for those who are new to Reddit and Pizzagate, then it's a risk that's worth it.</p></p>
