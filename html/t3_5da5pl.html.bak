        <p><p>the whole AMA was kind of weird. it was either the staff who desperately tried to use it to get people to notice. but kinda didn't know how to talk to people</p>
<p>or it was someone pretending to be them and thats why the anwers were weird</p></p>

        <p><p>Julian Assange has not been seen in over a month. There is rumor that he may have been taken and/or killed by NATO forces. Since the Ecuadorian embassy cut off his internet, there have been dozens of signs indicating that something is not right. No proof, but there are many anomalies and strange behavior being exhibited by these people. </p></p>

        <p><p>I understand these concerns and am aware of them. It is a separate issue we are discussing. If wikileaks was compromised during the ama why make the comment? If TPTB is in control of wikileaks wouldn't the ignore the pizzagate question or deflect? </p></p>

        <p><p>Because it would be more of a problem if they failed to recognize it at all. They said they're intrigued by it. IMO they are phrasing it to sound like a conspiracy or like it doesn't have significance or urgency. But clearly from all these connections and the lives at stake here and for the sake of justice, there MUST be a formal transparent investigation into this. This isn't something to be brushed off. Not something to be taken lightly. This is a very deep rabbit hole and we only need one smoking gun to expose everything. </p></p>

        <p><p>My question is simple. If wikileaks was compromised during this AMA, why would they respond at all to this comment? Why acknowledge it? Unless you think an entity working along side the pizzagate investigation has control of wikileaks in which case why make such a vague comment? Why not go full support of the investigation? </p></p>

        <p><p>You think that comment is meaningless???</p>
<p>"It is curious." </p>
<p>This sub is being attacked CONSTANTLY for finding this whole thing <strong>CURIOUS</strong>. Do you not see wikileak's publicly perceived legitimacy and their subsequent legitimate admission that the emails in question are curious is one of the strongest pillars of the investigation?</p></p>

        <p><p>No. What would be odd is if TPTB controlled wikileaks, and then used that control to comment at all on <em>pizzagate</em> in a reddit AMA. </p>
<p>You are missing the point this whole comment thread stemmed from someone saying TPTB had control of wikileaks during the time of the AMA.  My retort is that why the fuck would TPTB comment on pizzagate as wikileaks.... They wouldn't. </p>
<p>Now if wikileaks was in full control of their name and commented in a cryptic way, that is odd and very encouraging for the investigation. </p>
<p>Which leads me to believe wikileaks was not compromised or if they are its by an entity that is okay pushing pizzagate into the public. </p></p>

        <p><p>Honestly Wikileaks is Assange, and if I haven't heard what he's said himself, I don't buy it. I'm sure there's a "crew" over there that runs the show while he's in captivity, but I'm taking things with a grain of salt considering he IS the chief editor.</p></p>
