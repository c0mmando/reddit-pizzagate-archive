        <p><p>This may not have any relevance whatsoever, but I found this and just do not want to leave any stone unturned.  I had to edit the above referenced paragraph to shorten it enough to put in the post's title.  It's the 4th paragraph on the linked page. </p></p>

        <p><p>Amazing find OP.
The fact that they have closed off, or even "hidden," any part of the original interior plan reinforces the possibility and probability of a secret section.</p>
<p>Someone downvoted this for reasons beyond me; this is a great find!</p></p>

        <p><p>There used to be a place called "Thai Room" where Comet is located now.  I have no doubt personally that Comet is involved in some truly horrible stuff but "Thai Room" is not some hidden or closed off part of Comet.</p>

        <p><p>It helps if you read the entire paragraph.
"For instance, the Thai Room isn’t there anymore, but I love that Comet kept its sign up on the back of the building (above the secret neighborhood entrance I took the Bitches through). Much like the Thai Room, Comet Pizza belongs to Forest Hills; only now, since the food is far beyond mediocre and the scene is so gosh darn hip, we share it with the rest of the city, like Tom Daschle and his grandkids who occasionally stop in for pizza and ping pong along with a barrage of hipsters and 20-somethings who make the trip up Connecticut Avenue."</p></p>

        <p><p>I honestly thought that the Thai room was some bricked off hideaway lol; I'm at the stage now where I would run a baggage trolley into a wall at comet ping pong just to put my angst at ease.</p>
<p>OP does make a valid point, what is this secret neighbourhood entrance and why was it, or is it, no longer...
I'm going to see if I can find the floor plan of this shit box.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's just a door that allows you to enter from the parking lot instead of walking around to the front.  It is not a "secret" in any meaningful way.  It is still there.</p></p>

        <p><p>Excellent find.  </p>
<p>It's got me wondering about the relevance of the long term history of the space.</p>
<p>Apparently, it was the Thai Room for long time:</p>

        <p><p>"...Comet kept its sign up on the back of the building (above the secret neighborhood entrance I took the Bitches through) " is obviously from 2011.</p>
<p>Any boots on the ground able to confirm this bit of nostalgia is still there now?</p></p>
