        <p><p>This is how we get skeptics and deniers to understand that this is not a conspiracy and that there are several underground networks of child trafficking all across our nation. For the people who haven't spent as much time researching the PizzaGate, it's an eye opener and it's an easy visual way of planting the seed for when this goes public. They won't be able to deny these allegations when there is so much truth behind them. </p></p>
