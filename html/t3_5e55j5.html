        <strong>List of Known/Highly Probable Pedophiles of Washington, DC</strong>
        <p><p>All of this information is compiled thanks to a fantastic video from <a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2015/10/19/the-peoples-campaign-the-real-hastert-case-all-in-one-place/">Boiling Frogs Post</a>. These are DC insiders, and a former FBI agent who really know their stuff. </p>
<p>The unfortunate take-away from the video is that it's far more valuable for intel agencies to collect dirt and hoard it to get these players to bend to the will of the shadow government. So, it's very likely that it's known to the institutions that can do something (FBI, DOJ, etc) that Podesta's a pedo... but that it's more useful as a secret. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the truth must be known, so on we go.</p>
<p>Here are the names and a few places to keep an eye out for in your own hunt. Good luck!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dennis Hastert (2016)</strong>: often went to Hanoi, Yangon, Bangkok, Myanmar, Saipan and other parts of SE Asia for girls (note: in the midst of the scandal, Podesta says that maybe it's time for him to go off to Japanese islands). Before his time as speaker of the house, he was let go as a wrestling coach because kids accused him of molestation. Part of delegations going to Thailand for the embassy's sex trafficking ring. Ciragan Palace in Turkey is another spot where pedophilic events happened for VIPs. He also accepted a rent-free townhouse from an ex-CIA agent (who then bugged it to witness him having underage sex).</li>
</ul>
<p>*<em>Note: Hastert was recorded doing lascivious acts by CIA, FBI, foreign agencies and corporations... all for blackmail. Clinton's Janet Reno claimed FBI's evidence was inadmissible and covered it up. Bush administration then shut down investigation entirely. Media covered it up, too. Present day, Hastert's case regarding fund impropriety has implications throughout the Chicago scene, implicating higher-ups like Rahm Emanuel and Obama.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tom Delay/Jack Abramoff:</strong> Possible, as they visited Saipan frequently where young children were often trafficked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chief of Staff for Lamar Alexander, Ryan Loskarn</strong> (2013): Arrested for having GBs worth of graphic cp on his harddrive. Likely distributor, given size. Shortly before investigation, he was "suicided" by hanging. No autopsy or toxicology. Chief aid to members of House of Reps, same time as Hastert. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anthony Weiner</strong>: husband of Huma Abedin (close Clintin aid), under investigation for sexting underaged teen, computer confiscated by NYPD/FBI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mark Foley (2006):</strong> Sexted underage congressional pages (Like Weiner, it's likely worse, but that's what he got busted for). Ironically was part of "United States Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>John Mark Karr (2006):</strong> ran Thai pedo ring for embassy circles there, including American embassies. American ambassador here likely implicated. Karr taught English to young kids. Got caught by sting trying to procure kids. Said he procured young girls and boys for "visiting VIPs" at embassy in Bangkok. CIA told him to (falsely) admit to killing Jon Benet to get extradited back to States. Case was let go the minute he arrived Stateside. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jim Colby, AZ Republican:</strong> Came out as gay, but also took underage paiges to AZ for "camping trips" and was brought up to ethics committee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Larry King (not TV or boxer):</strong> Trafficker from Boys Town who brought them from Livingston to DC. Members of Reagan administration took part of such parties. Bush cabinet official was the same. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VP George HW Bush (during 80s)</strong>: likely solicited gay prostitute, Jeff Gannon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>William Casey, CIA Director (during 80s)</strong>: Likely solicitor of male prostitutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Frmr Atty General Richard Thornburgh (during 80s)</strong>: Likely was involved with young boys</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: During B Clinton, White House directed FBI officials to "collect information using FISA" to members of Congress and establish specific information on all politicians. Known as COINTELPROII. They hid behind noble ideal of cracking down on corruption of govt officials, and collected info on Hastert, Livingston (which is why he abruptly resigned), Blunt, Dan Burton.</em>  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Robert Creamer (yeah, the Clinton guy)/Jan Schakowsky</strong>: When going to Morocco and Turkey, received sexual favors (may not have been with kids though). People in the entourage who visited these companies in these foreign countries engaged in acts with little boys and girls, and the CIA (along with other intel agencies) recorded it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bob Bauman (early 80s)</strong>: Congressman who had sex w/16-year-old boy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Larry Craig (early 80s)</strong>: Not indicted, but implicated in Franklin scandal and alleged for drug use with underage teen boys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Large donors to Sandusky's Second Mile Foundation</strong>: Many were the "customers" of the troubled youth who were pimped out. Graham Spanier (Penn State president) very likely involved, esp due to being in Nebraska at the same time as Franklin pedo scandal.</p>
</li>
</ul></p>

        <p><p>I think you're going to have to provide some support for these accusations. You can't just say these people did these things because you heard it in a YouTube video... for example, Creamer. Where is this info from? </p></p>

        <p><p>Sibel was the FBI translator for all Turkish material for about 5 months with the bureau before becoming a respected whistleblower. During her time there, she picked up intel from one Turkish spy who specifically needed favors and certain things passed from Creamer and Schakowsky. </p>
<p>This was part of a broader problem of <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2005/09/edmonds200509">espionage</a>, whereby a Turkish operative was working from inside the FBI and was selling state secrets for big money. She was also ensuring that material related to specific targets got buried by marking it as "not important" so the intel would never get reviewed.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="http://100percentfedup.com/theres-way-story-democrat-felon-caught-undercover-video-admitting-massive-vote-fraud-video/">another article</a> on it, but it also relies on that which Sibel says.</p>
<p>It's up to you to believe it.  </p></p>
