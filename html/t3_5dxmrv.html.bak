        <p><p>No.</p>
<p>I posted 2 topics.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a podesta email that talks about arranging transport for two 7 week old puppies. The estimated weight is 10 lbs per puppy.</li>
</ol>
<p>7 week old puppies are not 10 lbs. Human children are.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bohemian Grove has terrible reviews from staff working there, of RAMPANT mistreatment and hazing by political figures. They seem very willing to talk and help. They should be contacted.

        <p><p>Okay so your puppy weight assumptions are not entirely correct. 10lbs for a 7 week old puppy can be quite right.</p>
<p>At seven weeks of age, a healthy Labrador retriever puppy's weight is generally between 12 and 14 pounds.Â According to GottaLoveALab.com, a Lab puppy should weigh 2 pounds for each week of its age.</p>
<p>However, female Labs are generally smaller than males, and a lower weight is acceptable.</p>
<p>These stats are for healthy labs, there exist other smaller dog breeds too.</p></p>
