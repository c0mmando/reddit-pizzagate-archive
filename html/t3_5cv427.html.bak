        <p><p>Finally, something I can opine on with regards to this whole insane debacle that we see unfolding! I'm not necessarily Velma from Scooby Doo or anything—so I am unsure if any of this input matters. However, I am a member of the LGBTQ community with incredible decorating skills. And that's all the personal details that I'm willing to say in this forum. So let's go for a spin:</p>
<p><strong>The damning circumstances of this photo (according to my perspective):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prominent placement of plush toys in a rich childless couple's main bedroom. I have been in many homes of many people from all sides of the social-economic scale on multiple continents, and I have never seen anything like this. That may come off as hyperbole, but I would honestly ask my affluent childless friends why they had some cheap plush toys sitting out in the open and why they were ruining the aesthetic of a magazine-worthy room in what is obviously a very expensive home. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plush toys stand out so starkly <em>because</em> the room is so minimally and modernly appointed. If Podesta were an affluent collector of quirky ephemera (such as Victorian English taxidermy or something along those lines), I would feel less skeevy looking at plush toys in this bedroom were it—say—a more traditional style room festooned with rows and rows of shelving meant for a myriad of collectibles. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prominent placement of plush toys during a publication's photo shoot. As we are becoming aware, we see that there have been indicators that the pedocabal got their jollies from "hiding in plain sight" by proudly broadcasting a beacon/symbol/image to like-minded child abusers that goes unnoticed by the general populace (Besta Pizza's logo, for example). I myself am very optics-oriented, so I would definitely have my home in showroom condition with goofy personal stuff stashed away if you were to tell me that <em>Elle Decor</em> magazine was coming to snap pics to share with the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of the room in which we find these toys. Pray tell, where are you most intimate in your home? Where are you naked the most in your house? Where do you have sex? Where do you check that weird mole between your legs? Where do you piss and shit with the bathroom door open? Probably your bedroom. So what gives with these out-of-place infantile cheap stuffed animals sitting around in a room where one is either sleeping or "taking care of business" in some manner?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The only possible justifications of the photo that I can fathom are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The toys are sentimental in some way. My heteronormative masculine father has one of those old Christmas tree elves that he loves to pull out of storage and put onto the tree annually. We all have special things that are priceless to ourselves yet worthless to others. So does Tony or his spouse have a soft spot for some specific stuffed toys that have warm memories attached to them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps plush toys were inserted into the shoot in order to stage the home as more "lived in" and less like a real estate ad. However were I the photographer, I simply would've made different choices in terms of what cute items I would have put out and where. And were this the case, I would likely put cute kid toys in a place like the family room or the study. The context would be that visiting nieces/nephews/friends' kids can entertain themselves whilst the parents continue drinking and gossiping like adults in an adjoining (and relatively public) room. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Avenues to explore in order to obtain more clarity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is the <em>worth</em> of the plush toys? Are they rare collectibles? This is where I could see the best justification for this awkward scene we are witnessing in a powerful person's most intimate room—their bedchamber. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How <em>old</em> are the plush toys? If they are vintage from the 1970s or something and there is a tearjerker sentimental story attached, then perhaps there's "nothing to see here" after all. But if they were mass-manufactured mere years ago and barely retail for $30 or so, then it's a bad design choice for such a lavishly expensive room built and decorated for (supposedly) sophisticated political socialites. </p>
</li>
</ul></p>

        <p><p>Thank you! After I posted it, I realized it felt a bit silly to write such a long screed regarding some small detail about some straight dude's bedroom. But upon further reflection, I have to say that I'm just not gonna let this one slide. </p>
<p>I mean c'mon, the Podestas aren't rich and tasteless "new money" Oklahomans (no offense to anyone from there). When you have prime real estate, amazing power, and multiple connections in what is considered to be the most powerful city on the surface of the planet, then you know exactly what you are doing at all times and how you are perceived by others. </p>
<p>In politics, optics is e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g. And in the annals of wealth and power, everything you do, anything you say, how you dress, what you serve at a party—it will all either enhance or detract from your political candidate or perhaps the deal that you are trying to forge. I almost shared some personal anecdotes in this post, but I deleted them and won't publish them. Let's just say that I've been to a Georgetown brownstone or two for a soirée and have seen how everything is meticulously choreographed to the most minute detail. So if the Podestas or their people give us innocuous puppy-dog eyes and stress the innocence of some cute plush toys that are purposefully situated <em>directly next to a Kleenex box that Mr. Podesta likely utilizes after a session of masturbation in his bedroom</em>, then I will emit such an incredulous guffaw that it will be heard all the way up in outer space. </p>
<p>Suffice it to say that I am extremely unnerved by the close brushes I have made to this horrifyingly extensive pedocabal in both my professional and personal life. That being said: I am still confident that we can unshackle ourselves from their grip and usher our species into a more enlightened, just, fair, and new paradigm. And that Pizzagate will be the catalyst that sets our collective onto a higher trajectory. </p></p>

        <p><p>One thing to remember, photoshop is not difficult to use. Without an actual source this is meaningless. </p>
<p>Edit: Sometimes I'm an idiot I did find this through the source listed on the photo. It looks real. </p>
<p>Edit 2: the magazine mentions Comet Ping Pong and his close ties with Alefantis </p></p>

The shills yesterday had 3 words with two underscores as well.  If you look through his post history he looks like a pedophile/pervert saying he is going to cum here and cum there etc.  This is also his first post here and using an old account so he doesn't care about his OPSEC since he is on the side of the pedophile shills.</p></p>

        <p><p>Wait wait wait wait.  As much as I agree with you we cant use this as damming evidence when it can be "explained away" so easily.  I was thinking the same thing.  If he has nieces or nephews,  if they can be said they were gifts.  We need stronger evidence.  Let's put this picture in an evidence category but it's not our strongest piece. Edit: spelling</p></p>
