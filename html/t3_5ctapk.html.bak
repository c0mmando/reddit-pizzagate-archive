        <strong>TIPS - DIGGING DEEPER</strong>
        <p><p>So here are tools we have available. Others, feel free to contribute.</p>
<p>Web Sites
1) User WHOIS sites to find IP related and owner information
2) Check and archive the source - there could be hidden info and also info on who created the sites
3) Check google chache data for sites. There are also other websites out there that can show website history. This will capture changes over time.
4) Check wikipedia HISTORY. Owners of businesses often update their own pages. For example, here for Comet Ping Pong (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Comet_Ping_Pong&amp;offset=&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history). Once you have a user, check to see which other pages that user is updating. This provides a HARD link.</p>
<p>Companies
1) Get registration and incorporation documents
2) Find heath and safety inspection documents</p>
<p>There are MANY tools at our disposal. This only prodives a few. Please feel free to update.</p></p>
