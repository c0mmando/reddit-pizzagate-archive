        <strong>Need eyes on this - think there is deep water here</strong>
        <p><p>I think we have a good source of further digging, in Kim Noble/Ria Pratt. She is the artist of the most disturbing artwork that has been cataloged so far:</p>
<p>https://www.saatchiart.com/Pratt</p>
<p>It turns out that Kim Noble, the artist, is a victim of ritual abuse. She has DID - disassociative disorder. The personality that created those works is her personality names Ria Pratt. Many of these in a quick google search and in the linked - I'd not seen before and are worse than the others I had seen and didn't think that was possible. I'm still very much just at a 30K vantage point of exploration into her work, but she is looking more sympathetic as a victim of abuse. </p>
<p>Where we need eyes is that her art has a LOT of written wording in her works and I think we have a lot to parse through. I think there will be some revelations here that we can almost consider as a eye witness rather than conspirator. </p>
<p>A very long and in depth article that I think is worth digging through more about her and this personality Ria Pratt:</p>
<p>http://www.pseudoccultmedia.net/2009/12/art-of-dissociation.html</p>
<p>EDIT: Kim apparently has an autobiography entitled "All of Me"</p>
<p>Keep up the good work, all involved. Do not be swayed or dissuaded by CTR. This is critical work.</p></p>

        <p><p>Gotta say, one of the most suspicious things about that pizza place to me is that one of the top things they mention in their description is secret hidden bathrooms. First, that's strange by itself. But why is that something you specifically point out to advertise?</p></p>

        <p><p>The little girl in the Hampstead video freaked out when her brother said her name and quite meekly asked him to not say it. If I remember correctly, Kim Noble hated being referred to as Kim for most of her life but grew used to it with time. </p>

        <p><p>Agreed and worth pointing out that Comet goes and uses it as a fucking poster for a band date...you grow up and the world gets smaller and you think you pretty much know how it all works and then shit like this happens and you reset and you're small again, realizing how much in fact goes on that you have no idea of, and can't make sense of - yet anyway.</p></p>

        <p><p>How does this one ever make sense?  I'm honestly not sure how much motivations matter in things like this.  Understanding the reasoning might help us connect things, but it's horrifying.</p>
<p>I kind of think we just need to find the boundaries of what this is.  And then burn it with motherfucking fire.</p></p>

        <p><p>the only validity in this thread is linking to marina:
how marina abramovic's artwork is so openly aware of pedophilia rituals. unless im unaware of different cults of very similar rituals. </p></p>

they say the right sperm
the right egg the right time
wrong time
right blue right red
she will be creative
wrong creativity</p>
<p>fucked buggered, totured
she is still she is silent
is she dead?
wrong time</p>
<p>pratt was here</p>

        <p><p>I don't think there's a need to analyze the art specifically, it's pretty straight forwards honestly, but if she is really a victim of this process, then it would seem very important to me to analyze her actual life story and back ground.</p></p>

        <p><p>well, theres the psychological aspect at play,the "give and take", being nice for a second and then turning all brutal on them. almost all the artwork shows mental adaptation to their toture(like mental blocking from the projection artpiece), techniques they used, and the complexity of her brain. </p>
<p>whats interesting maybe is the black and white, which has quite the major emphasis on, like the black and white hankerchief? im assuming its checkered. also, so far relating to this, hamstead+14 fish descriptons: i think the cult theyre alll refering to is Order of the golden dawn right? </p>
<p>i didnt read much into that one</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, Order of the Golden Dawn is who I saw mentioned. So I meant, research that group, who is it? Where are they based, what else do we know about this group/ these people. As I'm researching this myself, I'm realizing that there are a lot of people who have been researching this for years and haven't been taken seriously, so I'm going down their rabbit holes, although I think this sub needs to stay more focused on pizzagate/ Podesta themselves.</p></p>

        <p><p>From this link, https://www.saatchiart.com/Pratt</p>
<p>"About Ria Pratt</p>
<p>Ria has DID and is one of Kim Noble's personalities. From the age of 14 years old Ria has spent 20 years in and out of hospital until she made contact with Dr Valerie Sinason and Dr Rob Hale at the Tavistock and Portman Clinics."</p>
<p>Tavistock?  Anybody looked into those doctors?</p></p>

        <p><p>Valerie Sinason is a psychoanalyst famous for claiming that satanic ritual abuse and monarch programming is widespread and more common than we think. She believes Kim Noble is a victim to it and that everything depicted in her art is real and actually happened. Sinason has met a lot of resistance though, with people going out of their way to delegitimize her work.</p></p>

        <p><p>look at the similarities with another artist Tony follows. I read in an art mag that he prefers to collect 10-20 works fromthe same artist. Makes me wonder what other works he has of Noble's and Bourgeouis. These works sure seem to indicate some kind of splitting or shattering of the mind. </p>

        <p><p>You're getting dv'd but who can really blame you for feeling this.</p>
<p>But i have to point out.  She's just painting it.  She's most likely a grown up victim still involved.  She might be guilty.</p>
<p>A lot of these monsters probably started as victims.  These are dynasties of abuse.</p>
<p>Did you notice Trump instantly softening on Hillary?  He's not the angry abusive guy going after her anymore.  He's talking gratitude.  While the FBI investigates.  This is emotionally and morally complex.</p>
<p>There'll be more twists and turns before this is over.  I guess what I'm saying is, imagine if Hillary flips.</p></p>
