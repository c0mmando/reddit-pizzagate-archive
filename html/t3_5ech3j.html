        <strong>Heavy Breathing removes public statement about Pizzagate</strong>
        <p><p>Did anyone else notice the removal of the post commenting about it? I'd been checking to see what had been discussed as someone was pointing out all the sketchy information but it has been removed. I was hoping someone knew what her responses were to some of the scrutiny being addressed in that conversation</p></p>

        <p><p>You mean this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ever get lumped into a right wing conspiracy theory that you knew nothing about? I sure did, along with my band, Heavy Breathing.</p>
<p>Last week, when Hillary Clinton’s emails were released, a notoriously scandalous internet message board quickly invented a wild story that suggested Clinton, her campaign chairman John Podesta, and beloved local restaurant Comet Pizza &amp; Ping Pong were part of a secret pedophile ring. No such pedophile ring exists to my knowledge. This internet group found my YouTube video of my performance character -- Majestic Ape -- doing a comedy roast for a friend on her 30th birthday, an event which happened to be held at Comet.</p>
<p>In junior detective, connect-the-dot, conspiracy fashion, some members of the aforementioned message board chose to use Heavy Breathing’s images, music, and videos to tie us in with the imagined Podesta conspiracy in the hopes of fanning the flames and getting people on board for a witch hunt. While Heavy Breathing’s music and imagery can be juvenile, dark-humored, cryptic, and sometimes in poor taste, it's nothing other than the work of three people who like to hang out and make music and images together.
This harkens back to the mid 1980’s, when uptight people (PMRC, religious groups) believed certain bands were “satanic” and were corrupting the youth. “Kiss” was thought to be an acronym for “ Knights in Satan’s Service” ; AC/DC was said to be an abbreviation for “Antichrist Devil Children.” How sad that little has changed. I guess one positive thing coming out of this Is that, even in 2016, rock bands can still piss off angry, fearful, paranoid folks.</p>
<p>Just check out the classy comments we’ve been getting: https://www.youtube.com/user/HeavyBreathingBand</p>
<p>The best and classiest comments can be read on our last video:
https://youtu.be/zo_euND7Acs</p>
<p>Lots of good old-fashioned threats, racism, and hate going on here. My extended family happens to be a community of artists, musicians, activists, writers, film-makers, and scientists. We all need to remember that the hateful mob mentality is still going strong. I (We) will not be bullied and we will not be censored. We all have many battles ahead. Sending love, strength, resilience, and persistence. -Amanda Kleinman, and the Heavy Breathing team.</p>

        <p><p>It's so stupid trying to garner sympathy claiming some bands are accused of being satanic. Some bands obviously are satanic, like slayer or slipknot. But it's not a problem. Nobody cares it's just part of their band's image. But if your band's image involves ritualistic pedophilia, then there is going to be a fucking problem. </p></p>

        <p><p>It's still on their Facebook page. And that's the same exact phrase the clintons used for the Lewinsky scandal. ... sometimes it's not what you say, but how you say it that says it all</p></p>
