        <strong>Sorted by New, posts here are appearing out of order</strong>
        <p><p>Not sure what's going on. See a lot of people saying they're not seeing their posts and stuff. On Alien Blue I sort by New and the posts are ordered randomly ie - 1 hr ago, 1 hr ago, 20 hrs ago, 4 hrs ago, 2 hrs ago, etc </p></p>

        <p><p>In the official Reddit app everything seems to be fine. </p>
<p>Edit: looks like it was a temporary occurrence from earlier. Current posts from the last few hours are in order. Posts between one day and 8 hours ago are all mixed up. </p></p>
