        <strong>A Report on the Child Trafficking Industry in The United States</strong>
        <p><p>This is a work-in-progress essay about the state of the expanding child-trafficking industry in the United States. </p>
<hr>
<p>Pizzagate is an ongoing series of investigations into the suspicious activities of high-ranking elites of Washington, DC. The investigations began after a user discovered from the Wikileaks email releases, that the members of the Clinton Foundation had an abnormal obsession with discussing “pizza” in their emails, which arose the suspicions that these were actually codewords for something completely different. After researching the connections a user found that they were regularly holding “pizza meetings” at a particular restaurant, owned by the 48th most powerful man in Washington, DC. His name is James Alefantis.</p>
<p>Looking into his social networks, users had discovered that surrounding this man was a community of people with an abnormal affection for art featuring under-aged children and satanic symbolism. People began theorizing that this was a potential community of pedophiles, to discover that the entire block surrounding the restaurant were shops with blatant pedophilia symbolism used among pedophile communities, which were afterwards all connected to the Clinton Foundation. Discovery after discovery, users were overwhelmed by the atomic number of “coincidences” that linked together and eventually realized that it was all true.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the state of the child-trafficking industry. In 2007, there were over 5,682 child traffickers prosecuted in the United States, of which 60% were convicted. 2014, there were 10,051 prosecutions, but only 44% were convicted [2, p.60]. This indicates that the while the number of prosecutions of child traffickers doubled, the conviction rate of said traffickers made a dramatic fall over the span of 7 years, despite a 150% increase in budget allocation in 2014. These numbers indicate that the demand for child-sex slaves has doubled, that the government has become lenient towards child molesters, and demonstrates how they've made no progress in the battle against the increasingg child traffickers while increasing budget expenditure to no effect. This industry is expanding and these figures only scrape the surface of the human trafficking epidemic that is occurring worldwide. </p>
<p>To understand why such an inhumane practice can exist on such a grand scale, we will revisit the fact that human trafficking is a business. All businesses, regardless of its legality, operate under the law of supply and demand: with every demand follows a supply. The numbers shout to us that there is a demand for child sex slaves, and that there are people monetizing over this at the expense of the children's lives. If the United States alone has thousands of cases per year, you couldn't imagine how rampant issue is in third world nations. But who is paying these child traffickers?</p>
<p>According to The Thorn, a child trafficker can make between $150-200,000 per year over a single child [3]. Considering the average age of entry into the trade is 14-16 years old, we can deduce that the prices rise as the ages go lower. This revisits the fact that the clients who pay these traffickers are people of high wealth. On an individual scale, this propagates the notion of why politicians and elites are often involved in scandals around the practice. Unfortunately we live in a day and world where your wealth can protect you from persecution of a crime.</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that people visit third world countries for the sole purpose of purchasing at lower risk and an even lower price. According to a 2007 report, people can have sex with a 13 year old girl for as low as $1 [4]. A case example would be in 2010, when 10 American missionaries were charged for attempting to kidnap 33 children in Haiti after the earthquake. When I say ten Americans, I actually mean there was a band of ten grown adults conspiring a large-scale kidnapping. 9 of them were released after negotiations by Bill Clinton, while the leader, Laura Silsby, was found guilty of her charges due to circumstantial evidence, further reiterated when her defensive attorney was found to be a wanted sex offender and human trafficker [6] in the United States. These people live in a reality different to ours.</p>
<p>Haiti and other undeveloped countries are vulnerable to all kinds of crimes and exploits. In times where American Red Cross can get away with $500 million of Haiti Earthquake donations without any explanation whatsoever, it seems reasonable to propose a thorough investigation into the corrupted state of the country. </p>

<p>Type "child" in the search box... and see how prevalent trafficking is... even mentions of youth organizations, military and children's shelters. </p></p>

        <p><p>Nicely written. My sense of pedantry urges me to suggest that "the 48th most powerful man in Washington, DC" be put inside quotation marks and the claim sourced, since it is a bit silly and arbitrary. </p></p>
