        <strong>We Should Focus Research into Established Connections</strong>
        <p><p>I spend my time lurking through these posts making a collection of those that appear to make the best connections, however I believe there is a lack of focus that surrounds the subreddit and I want to encourage our researchers to look into connections that are established. </p>
<p>Right now we have established that Sir Clement Freud was an exposed pedophile who had a house near the area where the McCann child has disappeared. We also know that Sir Clement Freud is an associate of the Podesta brothers and that there are police sketches of two individuals that look exactly like the Podesta brothers. I believe we should try to find out whether the two were there the day of the disappearance in order to find our smoking gun and go after other connections afterwards that links them to the likes of Jeffrey Epstein, the Clintons and Comet Pizza and Ping Pong etc.</p>
<p>I'm going to be spending my time on this now, and wanted the others to know that I believe focus on established connections will push this research forward.</p></p>

        <p><p>How about this, and this may be able to solve everything: The children in those photos...where are they? Are they alive? Are they well? </p></p>

        <p><p>An interesting suggestion, though I would not even know how to look for them. Does anyone know how to search for people with the use of their photos? </p></p>

        <p><p>Nice suggestion, knowing how they usually report when political figures go around, maybe someone might have recorded something.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't like to promote posts that don't contribute something instead of offering more noise. But, in light of recent events, I tend to agree with you.</p>
<p>I think it'd be wise to either a) sticky this so others can see, or b) make a mod announcement saying posts need to be more focused on evidence/connections. The past 36 hours or so have been mind numbing here. Either we're running into dead ends, or shills are putting in work.</p></p>
