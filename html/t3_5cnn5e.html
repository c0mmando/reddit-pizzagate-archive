        <strong>Can we get someone to make some kind of infographic for new investigators?</strong>
        <p><p>So I just stumbled upon this whole thing and Im really wanting to dig into it and start looking for links for anything that may connect all this. Anyone have a graph or chart that connects all the locations and people we have absolutely confirmed are connected so far? That way I can look for new things and not tread on info we already have.</p></p>
