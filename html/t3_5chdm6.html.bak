        <strong>Simple Q: Where was Podesta on evening of 3 May 2007?</strong>
        <p><p>I would like to see all of this debunked so we can all go back to normalcy, but can't seem to. </p>
<p>So perhaps we should focus on a big aspect: did Podesta have anything to do with McCann's abduction?</p>
<p>The official police renderings of the suspect matches him, ostensibly. </p>
<p>His emails are gone starting on the 4th of May, 2007 (the day after McCann's abduction).</p>
<p>So someone (or Podesta himself) can put this part to rest by simply providing empirical confirmation that he was not in the area of McCann's abduction on May 3 2007. </p>
<p>Very simple. Where was he?</p>
<p>EDIT: Use this as a meme to make this question viral until a sufficient answer with empirical confirmation is provided: http://imgur.com/a/hwinA</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, this is getting sloppy and out of hand...no to mention that no one is verifying the intentions of the posters here. </p>
<p>All these posters and all this shit is literally from the Russian government. All these posters and people...look at their accounts and how old they are. Look at what they are "mods" of. None of them are over 6-7 months old, and the accounts that are are the people like you not pressing a "DNC" narrative. I think you all are getting duped by Russians.</p></p>

        <p><p>There's a vicious rumor going around that <strong>JOHN PODESTA ABDUCTED MADELINE MCCANN</strong>. There is absolutely no truth to the rumor that <strong>JOHN PODESTA ABDUCTED MADELINE MCCANN</strong>, and it would be irresponsible for anyone to repeat the allegation that <strong>JOHN PODESTA ABDUCTED MADELINE MCCANN</strong>. So whatever you do, don't go around saying that <strong>JOHN PODESTA ABDUCTED MADELINE MCCANN</strong>.</p></p>

<p>I have nothing to disprove the Maddie McCann stuff, but i fine this fox article/video interesting. In it it states the UK police know exactly who did it, but can't do anything about it. They say thieves took her. Maybe. </p>
<p>Both panelists find this situation unusual and question why the identity of the suspects would be with held.</p>
<p>What if they can't tell who did it because they know its high ranking US official and they made up a silly story about thieves to distract. </p></p>
