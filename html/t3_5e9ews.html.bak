        <strong>Can the mods update the sidebar with more relevant information?</strong>
        <p><p>The sidebar in this subreddit is really bad, that's why we have a new post every hour of someone asking to give them a summary of the evidence.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114013840/https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5b1qtf/comet_ping_pong_pizzagate_summary/">An updated version of this</a> would be a lot more helpful. <a href="https://vimeo.com/192532231">This video</a> would also be a good addition for people who don't like to read as much. Those are just suggestions, it would probably be better if a mod made a comprehensive summary of all the evidence we have so far, and updated it every day.</p>
<p>Basically anything is better than what is there really. It just looks like a wall of text with a bunch of miscellaneous information.</p></p>

        <p><p>The first two links on the sidebar are summary articles. Including the link you posted.</p></p>
