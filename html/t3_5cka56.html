<p>"I have the biggest untold story in America which seems to be blacklisted right now so I record videos trying to show the world what happened at my home.  I buy a home where the previous homeowner dies two weeks before closing and I then notice that somebody is repeatedly breaking into my home. About a year later, I'm shot from ground level two weeks after reporting a suspected smuggling tunnel to the El Paso DEA and then the Midland DEA who never looked. M phone records will prove these calls.  A group of still unidentified police were then caught sneaking into my home and staging the crime scene. I have proof of this uploaded to my Facebook right now (Buddy.Webb.353). My main goal is for the truth to come out and to expose this pre-installed tunnel which I was shot from. The other types of videos I create are "police scanner" videos from Midland and Odessa TX. Some of these are amazing and I've had several which have gotten over 1000 views.  This is the shortest possible version."</p>

        <p><p>Interesting post. Checked his other stuff. Interesting, though I feel there need be a little more context added. I grew up in the area that guy was working. Human trafficking is big across the southwest in general, so this makes lots of sense. </p>
<p>However People are generally more sexually active at younger ages out there so it's not uncommon for a higher than normal sex offender registry (something he used as proof in one of his vids). And homes off the grid and secret tunnels are used by cartel all the time for smuggling drugs. </p>
<p>However what is interesting is how the police began threatening him and how they had access to the phone records. It's strange because people who report Coyotes (Smugglers) tend not to get retaliation like that. He says he doesn't know 100% what he stumbled across. Either cartels or a a child human trafficking network (which is just a subculture of a much larger trafficking network).</p>
<p>If you wanna see something fucked up Check out the murdered/raped women of Juarez. Everyone knows its a massive conspiracy and no one can do anything. Juarez is fucking lawless</p></p>
