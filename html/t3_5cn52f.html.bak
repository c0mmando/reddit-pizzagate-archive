        <strong>Normally i wouldnt advocate this, but why hasnt anyone swatted the places?</strong>
        <p><p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting</p>
<p>Just seems like it it might be the only positive use of swatting.</p></p>

        <p><p>Posting this here because it's the newest.</p>
<p>We have an anon from /pol/ inside the Eagles nest now.  He is taking pictures of doors and stuff, nothing very damnimg obviously. </p>
<p>He says there are <em>tons</em> of kids there but that the place is packed as well so.. Also, he said some of the weird fucking art has been either removed or is covered with other pieces. </p>
<p>Lol this investigation is over.  They've cleaned up shop. </p></p>

        <p><p>I can't believe it's taken this long to get someone inside.   If I was in DC I would have gone last week.   Of course the weird artwork is now gone (they used to have a painting of a guy jizzing will playing ping pong with an alien).   Of course if the fucking FBI would do its job instead of protecting pedophiles we wouldn't have to play detective in the first place.  </p></p>

        <p><p>We told him to go to the men's room to find the "SHUT UP N FUCK" graffiti and the alien ping pong picture.  </p>
<p>They should have assembled like ten people in the DC area and gone in there, gotten drunk and started acting like cunts..  An in real life raid lol. </p></p>

        <p><p>At least have him confirm the new art is covering the existing art somehow.  Also, I am not sure if it is worth it but it would be easy to trip an electrical breaker and capitalize on the chaos to look around more closely... Maybe even see where the power room is, etc.</p></p>

        <p><p>I wouldn't recommend this. It would damage our reputation and what we're trying to achieve. Plus, it's not like these people are doing this stuff in the main areas where customers are. A SWAT team probably wouldn't uncover anything, especially when these groups are already on high alert</p></p>
