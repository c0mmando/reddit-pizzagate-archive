        <p><p>I would like to add this to the Texas side myself, since I can't find any clarification as to what happened with this children.</p>
<p>Doe anyone remember this?</p>
<p>https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/12/16/unaccompanied-children-crossing-southern-border-in-greater-numbers-again-raising-fears-of-new-migrant-crisis/</p>
<p>I am concerned that these kids could of also turned into an exploit considering they came unaccompanied, so how do we know if they even went back to their families or if they just disappeared into obscurity.</p>
<p>If I might add, this is just part of the search, but look at the numbers and growing concerns of children attempting to cross the border. Who is keeping an eye on all those children and how do we even know that they are all safe?</p>
