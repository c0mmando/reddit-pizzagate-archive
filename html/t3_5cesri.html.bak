        <strong>My hair-raising Madeleine McCann moment</strong>
        <p><p>Hello good people,</p>
<p>One of my adopted family is a Freemason and another is a pedophile so I have had some personal interest in this sort of thing for many years (neither of them know that I know and no, I've never been molested by anyone). I've been down rabbit holes the like of which I think you can all start to appreciate now. </p>
<p>The Madeleine McCann case has always bothered me, not merely because it was such a horrifying event but because I could never reconcile the parents' interviews with what I know of interrogation, forensics and plain old human nature. Both were so very clearly lying in their multiple TV appearances. I knew that and so did a lot of people. But both were also clearly distraught at the loss of their daughter. One way to reconcile this is easy: she died accidentally and they covered it up. But the <em>major</em> problem with that is the mother's immediate reaction: They've taken her! They've taken her! </p>
<p>Last night when I was browsing some of the horror threads for some potential way to help, it hit me out of left field that the McCanns could be lying about the reason for the disappearance <strong>and</strong> genuinely distraught for a very different reason: Madeleine was taken by powerful people and they knew it was going to happen and could do nothing about it. With all we've learned here about MK-ULTRA, mind control and the stomach-churning use of children as both gifts and fodder for these sick fucks, doesn't that theory fit a whole lot better? </p>
<p>Now here's the hair-raising moment: I went to my old go-to site for information on this sort of stuff and look up Madeleine McCann and what do I find? </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/YnCr9">whale.to describes it EXACTLY like I just said</a>.</p>
<p>Um, yeah. My hair literally stood on end. </p>
<p>I must have read this page years ago and dismissed it as mind-control, baby sacrificing Illuminati bullshit at the time. </p>
<p>Doesn't seem so implausible now, does it? In fact, <em>every single fact</em> of the case make sense when you see it like this. I think a VERY profitable new line of inquiry would be to try and connect the Podestas - I find the photofits very very compelling - and Jos√© Manuel Barroso who was president of the EU Commission at the time. I'm sure you'll be shocked to know he is now executive director of Goldman Sachs. Or perhaps not. </p>
<p>Go get em.</p></p>

        <p><p>I am involved, and working with other parents who are involved, with the Child Protective Services business in the US that steals children from their families and farms them into foster care or adopts them out. We have been trying to find a way to break through the corruption in this business that is run through the family court system. The child trafficking system in the US has been known to the intelligence community. It is my hope that with the added spotlight on the Clinton Foundation and the pedophilia ring that is getting ready to be exposed, that there are some out there that are digging that can help me connect the dots back to the foster care system, the adoption business, and the family court system. Hillary touts as one of her greatest achievements a bill that she helped to push through congress and Bill signed into law in 1997 that was a federal act called the Adoption and Safe Families Act. What it did was to incentivize state governments with federal money to adopt children out, instead of reuniting them with their biological families. Please, if there is anyone out there that can help me, I would greatly appreciate it. Personally, the state of KY has stolen my 7 homeschooled children and held them captive for almost 7 months. I know MANY, MANY families all across the country that are suffering under this system that gets away with stealing children from loving families because the family court system will not give the parents their constitutional rights. I am hoping with this new information coming out about the pedophile ring, we can FINALLY expose the evil deeds of this agency and the foster care system. Please, if you can. If you do come across something and you can't find me or reach me on here you can email the info to me at freethebabies2016@gmail.com or find me on Gab.ai as @MommyLove. Thank you!</p></p>

        <p><p>Yep. Governing bodies are set up to excuse the guilty and silence the accusers.  It's why everyone is so connected.  "You think we are doing something bad?  Fine we will set up this governing body to investigate"...The guilty are absolved and now free of prosecution until the end of time.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's been hiding in plain sight for decades. Hundreds of thousands of children go missing every year and nothing systemic happens to stop it. Now we know why.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not sure why you included that 'the intelligence agencies are aware'...the fact is that the CIA has been HEAVILY involved in child trafficking and blackmail for decades.  They're up to this evil crap up to the stinking, creepy, evil necks.  Just check out 'the finders cia tallahassee', or the franklin scandal, for a <em>taste</em> of the evil crap our tax dollars have been paying for.</p>
<p>The CIA, NSA, DIA and all the rest of them need to be blown into 1000 pieces, just like JFK wanted, before they murdered him.</p></p>

        <p><p>Great catch. A blood moon just after midnight and she was taken at ~10pm or so. More than enough time to move her to wherever the ceremony was taking place.</p>
<p>EDIT: maddy was taken in May not march - I misread your comment.</p></p>

        <p><p>i agree if we can protect our anonymity and continue to aggressively seek out the truth, people will join in the fight.  And if it becomes a whole new mass (transparent) movement of justice for children I think there may be hope for us yet.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's in there.  Wiki encouraged us through a tweet to keep digging.  When FBI Anon said that what would come to light would tear the country apart, I am almost certain he was talking about pedophilia.  Money laundering and pay to play are abstract concepts to most of us...We get that it's wrong but it doesn't resonate because it's hard to connect the dots.  Pedophilia is tangible.  It is understood by everyone and would not be ignored</p></p>

<p>MK-ULTRA was the code name for a secret CIA mind control program, begun in 1953, under Director Allen Dulles. Its purpose was multifold, including to perfect a truth drug for interrogating suspected Soviet spies during the Cold War. It followed earlier WW II hypnosis, primitive drugs research, and the US Navy's Project Chatter, explained by its Bureau of Medicine and Surgery in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request as follows:</p>

        <p><p>I was raised in 2011. Blue lodge only. I have never gotten into York or Scotish rite and do not know much about their degrees. I do love a big conspiracy theory, (i am very big into ufos and aliens) but I don't believe the masons are involved in this. My father in law has been in it for 50+ years and my wife's family are all very strict pentacostal.  If he had knowledge of any of this going on he would have exposed it and gotten out. I am not covering up if there is a cover up. If I did find out they were involved I would get out and expose as well, but for now my lodge is a bunch of great guys mostly old :-).</p></p>

        <p><p>They are definitely involved in criminal corruption along with many other groups. You must not be in the inner circle, or you are purposely covering it up. This goes deep. Part of the game is to surround themselves with naive innocent people who are oblivious to the truth and serve as cover. What degree are you? </p></p>
