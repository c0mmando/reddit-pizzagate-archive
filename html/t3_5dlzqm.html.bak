        <p><p>We will get more, man, but not if we keep spamming useless threads. We are only 10 days old, and a lot of this is unbelievable for most people.</p>
<p>Keep on track and keep digging. Spread the word. That is how we will get people's attention. Not by continuing to clog up the sub with posts like this, no offense.</p></p>

        <p><p>From your comment history I presume you're from Turkey ? I heard that your media started talking about that. <br>
You're already dealing with a colossal purge of "gulenists". Maybe Gulen and his followers are part of this powerful cabal. At this point I don't know what to think</p></p>

        <p><p>In Turkey, this shit is everywhere. Not just in social media, in my university we are talking about that(Im studying law) for last few days.  Also there is a lot of problems in here(economically,socially,politically) but we generally(except "radical fucking islamist")  have different look to the kids. And this story made all of us mad, really mad. Wish we can do something more.</p></p>

        <p><p>spread this info to your turkish friends in Germany. They will then spread it to natives. </p>
<p>maybe even link the refugee crisis and tell them its a cover to keep this human trafficking hidden and unnoticed. </p>
<p>No point  being angry at refugees when its politicians who need investigating</p></p>

        <p><p>Holy shit. When I joined after the election it was around 1,300 and stuck there for a couple days. Now it's 16,400 and rapidly growing. Is there a chart of how fast it's growing? We need to ensure that this phrase of "pizzagate" and the meaning behind it and everything it entails gets into the public consciousness so that people start asking questions outside of Reddit. </p></p>
