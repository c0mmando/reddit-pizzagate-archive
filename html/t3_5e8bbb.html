        <strong>ALERT: LivingResistance.com was Shut Down After Publishing PizzaGate information to an audience of over 900,000 people</strong>
        <p><p>This is a critical notice. I have been involved in this sub since the beginning (not a shill) and now think it is necessary to disclose some information as a basic safety protocol. </p>
<p>After I published information on LivingResistance.com and shared the publication on social media channels, the site was completely shut down. </p>
<p>It occurred approximately two hours after I published the following article on the site: http://livingresistance.com/2016/11/18/podestas-involved-mccanns-abduction-factual-analysis/</p>
<p>The article's social media spread reached around 60,000-- the shutdown froze the spread at that point. </p>
<p>It could have reached between 1.5-2 million if it were not for the shut down. More attempts will be made (and recorded with automated livestreaming backup). </p>
<p>What made me concerned about safety was that the shut down was not a DDoS attack or a DMCA notice, but a deep site-wide take down. </p>
<p>This has never happened before. </p>
<p>The site was restored after I alerted multiple trusted sources.  It appears to be operational now. </p>
<p>I see that the same thing happened with TheDailySheeple.com and feel it is wise at this point to compare notes. Here is what happened with TheDailySheeple.com: https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e80t0/our_site_got_shut_down_for_pizzagate_podesta/</p>
<p>As this appears to be an orchestrated attempt to disrupt multiple sites, along with the recent Twitter censoring, I am alerting this sub so we all have records. </p>
<p>I have also contacted several trusted sources letting them know the situation -- if anything happens to me, there is a following of around seven million people on social media channels that will receive word automatically.  </p>
<p>I am filing this notice here as well.  </p>
<p>Please remember this thread if anything happens. Thank you. </p></p>

        <p><h1>New Shill tactic</h1>
<h1>'Concern Trolling' changes to 'Crackpot Trolling'</h1>
<p>Its a perfect strategy for them to flood the site with crackpots for inevitable new visitors to see. They maybe staged or set up but it will tarnish the credibility of the investigation. </p>
<p>Nothing signals crackpot like antisemitism, stonemason rants. </p>
<p><strong>Mods - Ban this new shill tactic.</strong></p></p>

        <p><p>Exactly. Who does this when people are trying to uncover child abuse. Some one that lost empathy while chasing a white whale or someone with a more sinister interest. </p>
<p>Either way take it somewhere else voluntarily or with a ban. Or better yet, help by stick to the topic. </p></p>

        <p><p>Dude, for real? You know if you talk about Pizzagate elsewhere you will be called a crackpot conspiracy theorist? Like they said about people who questioned Hillary's health?</p>
<p>If I were you I would have a more open mind. Just because something is distasteful, or because everyone else thinks it's crazy, doesn't mean it's not true.</p>
<p>Instead of name calling why don't you, say, follow political correctness back to its roots, or have a look at % of millionaires by religion compared to % of population.</p>
<p>It's so crazy to me that you can be on board with Pizzagate and then dismiss other things so arrogantly and rudely. Honestly I don't know how it works.</p></p>

        <p><p><strong>Where did I say not to talk about Pizzagate?</strong> I said don't introduce, antisemitism, stonemason and 911 rants into this.</p>
<p>It not about what you or I think that is the issue.</p>
<p><strong>It is about focusing the mind of people on real child sexual abuse</strong> </p>
<p>Introduce too many side issues and you are not only shutting yourself down but also the voice of the children. And for what? To not miss a chance to revise history and to be right about the 'Jews'? </p>
<p><strong>We all should agree that the children is the only reason this sub is here.</strong></p>
<p>Keep that the one and only thing we advocate for and we cant go wrong! </p>
<p><strong>And please don't hide behind political correctness as a means to deny the voice of children. What your advocating is shouting tired old tales we have all heard before over the speech of screaming children.</strong> </p>
<p>No lets all get back to the kids!</p></p>

        <p><p>To be fair, I upvoted to raise awareness of Julian initially, then saw the later comments and realized I was upvoting Hitler shit and just reversed it.</p>
<p>When I see a long post like that, I further down to see if other people thought it was worth the read..</p>
<p>Turns out this guy literally thinks Hitler did nothing wrong...</p></p>

        <p><p>How about a potential Red-pill for YOU since you have an open mind, friend? Hear me out.</p>
<p>You know how one would make a shill powerful? By convincing a person that something so outlandish (like holocaust denial) is true, and combining it with information that relates to the subject you're trying to spread disinformation about (like pizzagate).</p>
<p>After you convince this person of this, they will become a disinformation spreading machine FOR you, because they so passionately believe in this thing that will repel potential pizzagate believers, they'll spread the disinformation wherever they can.</p>
<p>I don't go around calling people shills, and I feel kind of bad because you may not even know you are one,</p>
<p>But I'm not downloading that file you're spreading around here as desperately as you are and I'm not going to be distracted by your primitive nazi Ideals, please leave.</p>
<p>Edit: Remember when James Alefantis called us "conspiracy theorist, white nationalists made up largely of racists, homophobic individuals" when he spoke out?
Why would we want this PDF downloaded to our devices and this idea floating around in the sub? Sounds a little ironic to me.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm sorry brother, but the facts cannot be changed. Hitler was the good guy, and we've been brainwashed since kids to be triggered by his name because he tried to destroy our owners. I love Jews. I am not antisemitic. This is the truth. </p></p>

        <p><p>See, here's one of my issues with this shit. It seems to me that the your group would have me believe two things simultaneously:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>That reports of a holocaust are greatly exaggerated/false</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the jews are enemies</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically what I hear is that there was never any holocaust, and then they rail on the jews so much it make me think they would have one today if they could. Yes, it's possible that these two facts are compatible with each other. Yes, it's possible to completely loathe an ethnic group yet have your mistreatment of them be overstated or fabricated. But there needs to be a whole hell of a lot of context provided to get anyone to believe that this is in fact the case. </p>
<p>I know it's hard to prove a negative (here, that would be that the holocaust didn't happen, which is going to be extremely difficult lol), but the ashes shit isn't cutting it. They had all of Europe to spread those ashes over, and when you reduce a corpse to ashes there's just not that much left anyways. Yes, the Russians were despicable and I wouldn't trust them if they told me the sky was blue. But the holocaust was a European phenomenon. You've got a lot of missing non-combatant Jews to account for.</p>
<p>But before you can even get to dealing with the holocaust, you have to explain the contradiction before anyone will give you the time of day.</p>
<p>Why don't you explain your position on the Jews?</p></p>

<p>Hitler's biggest mistake <em>was</em> losing. There's no doubt about that. He didn't win, we did. He didn't get his way, we did. It's factual. Does that mean he should have won? No. Does that mean what he did wasn't wrong? No. </p></p>

        <p><p>I appreciate your post. I think most people in this sub have awoken to this #pizzagate and haven't been exposed to the existence of the underbelly of society before. An example is I was not shocked at all about Hillary and her minions being paedophiles, as I've been aware for years. Meanwhile, on this sub, many people are absolutely disgusted and taken aback because they never believed this could happen in our world on such a grand level.</p>
<p>Hitler is a very difficult thing to red pill on. I would refrain from mentioning him in this sub in the way you have only because you may have your argument disregarded regardless of if it contains important info.</p></p>

        <p><p>Look into it before you say that. Everything we know is being questioned right now. Judaism is a hot topic for a reason. We're programmed (if you like) from a young age to be triggered by the holocaust etc. Not by slavery? Nope. Not by the gulags? (And a lot more people died in them than concertration camps - they were run by Jewish generals). Why is it just this part of history we are afraid to talk about or question. </p>
<p>Just look into it. </p></p>

        <p><p>How do you know that? Do you know who is behind all of this? None of us do but I can say that there is a long long history of children being abused and tortured in ways similar to what were seeing here and all you have to do is look into it and you will see that there is a pattern. What is blood libel? How did that come about if not for constant accusations of such? In many different countries. There are coincidences and there are truths. Which is it? </p>
<p><strong>If what we are saying is so insane why does no-one say it in public? Why does no-one talk about this on the news when they're throwing around wild accusations? They would be arrested. Cut off air. Why?</strong></p>
<p>Believe what you will but don't believe what others tell you is true without looking at the other side. Why are we not allowed to ask Hitler's motives without being called anti-semite? Why are we not allowed to ask for proof of things beyond being told "that's just how it was". I don't know what happened but I do know that every historian who has tried to ask these questions has been arrested or ruined. Why?</p>
<p>Why did Michael Jackson blame the jews? He was a child molester...right?</p>
<p>If you are a gentile and this post is making you angry and nervous it is because you were made to feel this way as not to question it.  If you don't know what a gentile is look it up and you will see how much jews dislike them. </p>
<p>So you say this sub is not about that. I say until you find out who is behind the mask don't rule people out because in high school you were told they were victims. We were told black people were victims too. Where is their immunity from accusations?</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>If what we are saying is so insane why does no-one say it in public? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because it is a societal construct that is partially created by SJWs, the same as any other thing that you "aren't allowed to say".</p>
<p>You aren't even allowed to say if you're a Trump supporter, regardless of race or gender, without receiving a ton of hate.</p>
<p>Etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He was a child molester...right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No? He wasn't? Because it was already proven that the accuser was trying to pin it on him for money, as were the other people who came out.</p>
<p>He was someone who didn't have the right kind of childhood, and wanted to make sure that kids got to have a place where they <em>could</em> have the childhood he never had. People alleged that they were "sleeping in the same room as him", but his "room" was actually an entire floor or two or whatever of his home.</p>
<p>Was he weird? Sure. But so is Miley Cyrus, who is also behaving the way she is because of a repressed childhood. One chose to turn it into something positive (safe spaces for kids) and the other decided to do what ever she could to avoid conforming (except when it came down to political candidate.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are a gentile and this post is making you angry</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post makes me angry because you brought up Michael Jackson and his allegations when they were proven to be falsified. That's exclusively it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So you say this sub is not about that. I say until you find out who is behind the mask don't rule people out because in high school you were told they were victims.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not about that, and it's irrelevant; if someone who is Jewish is involved, they should be imprisoned. Everyone will agree. The Jewish part of his identity won't even be considered. Indeed, the major point of your posts were about "Hitler did nothing wrong" and "the holocaust was fake".</p>
<p>Tell me something, if the holocaust was fake, then how during an era where the internet did not exist and long-range communication was <em>severely</em> diminished, how do millions of people agree about the events? That's just not feasible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We were told black people were victims too. Where is their immunity from accusations?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Black people <em>are</em> essentially immune to accusation, because it always brings out SJWs and their race cards about how it's not racist against whites, but it is against blacks.</p>
<p>The reason for that is, as before, a social construct.</p></p>

        <p><p>I would just like to start with this: I did not say the holocaust was fake. In fact in my original post I said that more people died in gulags than in concentration camps. This contradicts your accusations of such.  I did not say Hitler did nothing wrong. I will put that down to you misunderstanding me and leave it at that. </p>
<p>I will re-iterate my point. We cannot question it. We get imprisoned. Our careers get destroyed. This does not happen to any other group of people. You will not get arrested for saying that slavery was fake. You might make black people mad and some SJW's might rough you up but the world will still turn for you tomorrow the same as it did today. There is a huge difference in the punishment for antisemitism and the punishment for any other hate crime. There is even a huge difference in what is classed as antisemitism compared to other racism/prejudice. You must insult a black person directly to be classed as racist. You can simply say that you believe Israel's military action in Gaza is disproportionate to the threat they face and you are called an antisemite. </p>
<p>The lack of freedom we are given to question a group of people is concerning to me. Especially considering they over saturate Hollywood and other high ranking positions in society. </p>
<p>Regarding my Michael Jackson remark you will notice the three dots before the word 'right?'. This was an attempt at creating a question for those of you who are reading my post. My personal belief is that he did not molest any children and that he was set up by more powerful people than himself. My opinion is not relevant here but if it makes you focus on what I am trying to say then so be it. He was recorded saying that be believed "they" were going to kill him. He accused the Jews of giving him everything and him ending up penniless. He said they do it on purpose. Whether he was talking about the same group of people I don't know but I do know that he died in very mysterious circumstances. </p>
<p>Please look into other mysterious deaths and what they were doing before they died. Such as JFK and Princess Diana. </p>
<p>There is a pattern but we are all too afraid to see it. </p>
<p>The people abusing these children are very very powerful. They will pin it on someone else if we do not figure out who they are soon. It has happened before and it will happen again. </p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>I did not say the holocaust was fake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're right; for the second time in the past two weeks I have mistaken your defense of his point as being him, himself. I apologize.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will re-iterate my point. We cannot question it. We get imprisoned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've never seen anyone imprisoned for having this line of thinking, and I am fairly certain I would've by now if it were happening. If you could provide some sources of people being imprisoned for questioning it, without resorting to any sort of violence or whatever, I'd be happy to read through it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our careers get destroyed. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this is a social construct, as I iterated before. No one wants to be associated with "that guy", just like they don't want to be associated with a sexist or racist, or anyone who can be perceived that way.</p>
<p>You're absolutely right that people will come down hard for saying it, but I still maintain that it's the same thing for other races.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must insult a black person directly to be classed as racist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I disagree with this analysis. Trump was being called a racist for wanting to put up a wall and make people come legally. </p>
<p>Trump was being called racist for not wanting Muslim immigrants into the country, when being a Muslim <em>is an ideology, not a race.</em> I think that alone is a recent and prominent example to point out the flaw with this part of your argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding my Michael Jackson remark you will notice the three dots before the word 'right?'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, I got that, but I had thought that we were starting to get over this as a society and understood that while weird, he wasn't guilty of the things he was accused of because the people came out and admitted it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My personal belief is that he did not molest any children and that he was set up by more powerful people than himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He wasn't really set up; he was alleged to have done it by a man who wanted money. FBI files released supported his innocence. His sister supported the claims because she <em>also</em> wanted money, 500K to be exact, but her claims did not turn out to be what she said them to be.</p>
<p>The media was unfair to Michael Jackson to be sure, and maybe he was "set up" by the elite on that account, but he was never convicted and Evan Chandler ended up committing suicide a few months after Michael Jackson's death, which further dampens those claims.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please look into other mysterious deaths and what they were doing before they died. Such as JFK and Princess Diana.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can't speak to Princess Diana; that's a hole I've never been down. But for JFK, the conspiracy theories are going to be there forever, even if they're debunked.</p>
<p>Because the assassination of a president is deservedly such a horrifying and <em>terrifying</em> event that people <strong>want</strong> it to be something more complex than it was.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The people abusing these children are very very powerful. They will pin it on someone else if we do not figure out who they are soon. It has happened before and it will happen again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, people already tried to pin such things on Assange.</p>
<p>Now he's dead, dying, captured or on the run, because he sure as shit isn't likely to be at the embassy when people are saying that he isn't there and he hasn't appeared at the window or had any communication face to face in a long time outside of a video that never showed them both in the same room at the same time.</p></p>

        <p><p>I understand that it's hard to have this shit thrown at you after a life of being told the opposite and believe me I understand the defence mechanism and built in assumption of holocaust denial. It is something we are all made to feel.</p>
<p>I will give you my best example of an arrest for holocaust denial which is David Irving. He was a well respected and accurate historian until he started to question Hilter's motives etc. While people might be disgusted by holocaust denial it is a human right to be able to believe what you believe, question what you're told and speak your mind. He was denied this and imprisoned. Here is a 'valid' news report:</p>
<p>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/20/austria.thefarright</p>
<p>Another. An 87 year old woman:</p>
<p>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11993382/German-Nazi-grandma-sentenced-to-10-months-in-prison-for-Holocaust-denial.html</p>
<p>There are laws which  criminalise this behaviour:</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial</p>
<p>As far as careers go I was referring to actually having them destroyed deliberately not just being alienated etc. I refer to Mel Gibson for example. His entire career disappeared after he said antisemitic things to a jewish police officer. John Galliano is another. I am not condoning their behaviour but athletes can get away with sleeping with underage girls and keep their careers. Justin Bieber can spit on his fans. Why are these people so different? What makes antisemitic remarks worse than beating up Rihanna for example? (referring to Chris Brown).</p>
<p>I understand that Michael Jackson had people blackmailing him. Those charges were proven false and that was that. My problem is that he knew people were trying to kill him and he said it. His sister said it. He literally said who ruined him. He actually used the word Jews. He may well have died because his doctor was an idiot but I disbelieve that. </p>
<p>When referring to Princess Diana I am talking about a similar situation. She knew someone was trying to kill her. She believed it was Prince Charles but she knew. Sources claim that she was about to start campaigning for Palestine. She was looking into Britain's sale of weapons to countries who did not respect human rights. Source for this from a 'valid' news website:</p>
<p>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1257242/Princess-Diana-killed-plan-frighten-went-wrong.html </p>
<p>She died before she could begin.</p>
<p>JFK made his famous speech about secret societies.</p>
<p>"For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</p>
<p>Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed." - Just a small part.</p>
<p>Below is a link to the letter sent to Ben Gurion regarding Israel's hidden nuclear program and withdrawing US aid. Note the date and year. </p>
<p>http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/israel/documents/exchange/01-01.htm</p>
<p>JFK would be assassinated later in the same year. Again another coincidence? or not? How many does there have to be for someone to consider that perhaps it is more than that? I wonder. </p>
<p>I'm not sure what you're trying to say with the mention of Assange but I will agree that I believe he was set up too. It seems a strange coincidence that he is such a prolific paedophile AND a man on the run from the government. What I was attempting to point out is that if we don't find out who is responsible soon we will be fed lies and lies until they become truth and we will never see truth again.</p></p>

        <p><p>Some of these seem pretty weird. I've been looking into Kurt Cobain's death recently and keep noticing similar dissension patterns to what we've noticed recently. Hear me out.</p>
<p>The reason I started prodding was based on my research into Soros and his time in Russia. Soros attributes a lot of his work to psychology experiments dealing with culture control. At the time (90s) it was fairly well known that rock culture had pervaded the public mindset. In Soros' own experiments, he proved with his social activist groups (pussyriot and later BLM) that he could do the same thing. Instead of statements about "fighting the man" and "not being a desk jockey", he counter cultured with things that appear logical, but are counter to their namesakes.</p>
<p>Prior to BLM, I would argue that racial tensions were pretty low relative to now. Despite their ridiculous actions, no one is allowed to say that they are against BLM because their namesake would imply that youre a racist. They use these techniques to discredit the groups opposing them.</p>
<p>Now how does this apply to Cobain? I think his death may have been designed to end the anti establishment trend of rock music. You may have noticed that rock is nowhere as big as it used to be. It's been slowly killed off with its removal from the radio and how it's presented in modern media. I know it's pretty out there, but his death is another one of the big controversial celebrity deaths and seems to lead into the control of modern culture.</p></p>

        <p><p>That makes sense to me. Especially when you look into the death of Tupac. FBI files have stated that he was being threatened by the JDL (Jewish Defence League). The death of black music that meant something and the rise of meaningless hip hop and people like Jay Z. Making the black community easier to subvert.</p></p>

<p>I have trouble coming to terms with pizzagate, and there is already way more evidence here for this fiasco.</p></p>

        <p><p>Since I have an open mind and am curious, I'll definitely look into this. However, it is a bit of a long read and I have some nagging questions that maybe you can shed some light on first.</p>
<p>A lot of the shady ritual abuse stuff surrounding pizzagate seems to stem from a lineage of occult beliefs and "mind control" practices (ie MK Ultra) that appear to have come here through Operation Paperclip, which imported many leading Nazi scientists/occultists/etc into the US. So if what you're saying is true, where/how exactly does all that fit in? Because didn't Hitler actively endorse all that occult/mind control research in the first place? And what about the theories of him possibly being a British (Tavistock) agent?</p></p>

        <p><p>The scientists who were brought in had their Nazism 'wiped' from record. What else? If you're willing to believe the holocaust wasn't what it seemed then perhaps you can believe that neither were Nazis. </p></p>

        <p><p>As I said, I'll give you an open mind and that's it. I'm not really interested in playing the "Hitler did nothing wrong" conspiracy theory because it's not even relevant to today.</p>
<p>For now, though I've saved your post for future reading, I want to focus on the conspiracy that's ahead of me, to see if I can wrap my head around it.</p></p>

        <p><p>Just chiming in to say I always get a large smile on my face when someone says they'll have an open mind to some of the most outrageous claims, and yet remain skeptical. You have a really good head on your shoulders. It makes me wonder about back in the day when people were so sure the earth was flat, and those kept trying to say it was spherical. It was outlandish, but turned out to be true.</p></p>

        <p><p>History is written by the victors. If #pizzagate is your first step into the abhorrent reality that we live in, you should be able to draw a likeness between your reaction immediately to the mention of 'Hitler wasn't as history portrays' is akin to that of the majority of people when you mention 'government pedophile ring'. </p>
<p>The information you have about WW2 is most likely from school or from official sources. Don't ever overlook information because it seems too ridiculous to be true without investigating. Come to your own conclusions.</p></p>

        <p><p>Look it up for yourself. Hitler and the Nazi's have a pretty solid = sign between them and evil, despite less solid evidence. I know this redpill is even harder to swallow, but how much more would you be surprised if I told you the evil of Nazi Germany was embellished, compared to the horror if I told you our politics are run by cannibals?</p></p>

        <p><p>There's so much proof of the holocaust, everything I've ever learned is about nazi's being evil, how can you possibly just expect me to believe they were not evil, they did not try to start a bunch of wars and they did not commit the holocaust. I atleast need some links. I am very open minded.</p></p>

        <p><p>Give me a second to concoct this redpill. </p>
<hr>
<p>Maybe you trust the Recross. Read the entire 1948 report. No mention made of mass Jewish genocide. </p>
<p>https://archive.org/details/ReportOfTheInternationalCommitteeOfTheRedCrossOnItsActivitiesDuring</p>
<p>If there would have been millions of people murdered then there would have been tons of human remains buried somewhere and it would be way too much to hide for very long. No tons of human remains were ever found. And if they would have been cremated then there would have been tons of ashes and no ashes were ever found.</p>
<p>There's also the fact that no one outside Soviet Poland had access to Auschwitz until the 1950's and that much of the "evidence" there was tainted or manufactured by the Soviets. There's a double standard (shock! Horror!) when it comes to Soviet propaganda of that era, we are taught to be skeptical of all Stalinist statements except when they support the idea of a "Holocaust'.</p>
<p>In books about World War II written by Churchill (6 volumes), Eisenhower, DeGualle (3 volumes), there is not a single mention of Jews being genocided in Nazi "death camps".</p>
<p>This is the best compilation I've ever found:</p>
<p><strong>http://www.realhistorychannel.org/THE%20BAD%20WAR2apdfversion.pdf</strong> </p>
<p><strong>http://nodisinfo.com/holocaust-against-jews-is-a-total-lie-proof/</strong></p>
<p>Whatever... I'm not wasting my time. You probably think 9/11 was perpetrated by Arabic retards with boxcutters. I'm just not wasting my time. I'm sorry I only have emails to mathematically prove half of the picture to you. </p>
<p>Sorry dude. My redpill sucks. Its all over 8ch.net if you look for it. It gets racist af over there though. They're right non the less :/</p>
<p>They made a lie so big I can't even begin to dismantle it.</p></p>

        <p><p>You can't use that red cross report.</p>
<p>When I visited Birkenau/Auschwitz in person they talked about how staged that red cross visit was, and how the Nazis were incinerating Jews a few hundreds yards away from where they made the whole thing look fairly humanitarian and on the up-and-up, but the red cross accepted what they were shown and did not dig any deeper. They were literally a few yards away from people who were starving to death and being murdered, and they didn't even poke around or ask to see anything that wasn't prepared in advance for them.</p>
<p>A better story is to dig a little deeper into the red cross. My grandfather was in the US Army during WW2, and the stories he told me about the red cross during that time, things he saw himself, made me forever very suspicious of that organization and unwilling to ever donate any money to them. The red cross still has a very bad reputation in most of europe because of their behavior &amp; activities during WW2.</p>
<p>One example was when he came off the front lines, exhausted, freaked out, his best friend from high school had just been blown up right in front of him. There is the red cross with hot coffee and donuts. For pay. The fucking soldiers had to PAY for hot coffee behind the lines. By comparison the Salvation Army was giving everyone wool socks and other gear as they got on the ship to be transferred to Korea - they didn't know yet how cold it was going to be there, and their army-issued gear was not sufficient.</p>
<p>The red cross is seriously fucked up.</p>
<p>Until you've been to Auschwitz yourself and you've seen the gas chambers with claw marks all over the walls or the thousands of pounds of human hair that was harvested, I don't believe you have any authority to speak on this issue.</p>
<p>What I have seen with my own eyes are the meticulous record books the nazis kept on all the people they interred, killed, and experimented on.</p>
<p>Go see it for yourself, then tell me what you think.</p></p>

        <p><p>Oh. Here are the meticulous record books they kept: </p>
<p>http://thegreateststorynevertold.tv/official-german-record-prisoners-auschwitz-concentration-camp-may-1940-december-1944/</p>
<p>They saw oversaw 500 thousand people in the entirety of the camps (Jews and non Jews included) die, according to them.</p>
<p>SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU SHILL AND TELL ME WHY "THEY WEREN'T REALLY METICULOUS"</p>
<p>OR </p>
<p>Look at fucking Eisenhower’s Rhine Meadows Death Camps – A Deliberate Policy of Extermination. Look at the fire bombings of almost every major German city. </p>

        <p><p>Yeah. He hella demonized Jews, but he didn't commit mass murder. He put them in camps, but the showers didn't spray cyanide, thank god. </p>
<p>I would be a neonazi if Hitler hadn't made the retarded mistake of conflating a group of about 15 to 30 people (the actual syndicate) with tens of thousands of normal Jews. He done fucked up unimaginably. They boycotted the Reich and shit, but he should have just ignored it and respected them. The German people were willing to go along with something much darker. </p></p>

        <p><p>Finding it hard to believe to the book that was written by the same person who made a book about how Putin is actually a good guy. I'm Russian and every sane Russian hates this greedy rat and his government. 
So, simply judging by the author, I really doubt that this book is actually legit.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes lots of people died ww2, but the gas chambers, the human soap bars the lamps made from flesh are quite frankly outright lies and anti white propaganda.  Again go research it, the lies fall apart within hours. No mention of gas chamber anywhere since the early 70s I belive. </p></p>

        <p><p>I'm no hitler fan but as far as I can tell reading into some revisionist history, Hitler didn't want a world War and was forced into it by the British and Jewish interests. Churchill is remembered as a great hero, yet he was a psychopath that firebombed every major German city like dresden holocausting every living thing in sight. Think innocent people melting into the tarmac to get the picture. Maybe you should read some David irving and have a look at some other revisionism works. See those big plies of bodies in the camps that's the result of desiese and starvation from the allies bombing all the  railroads into the camps. I warn you this documenty is more disturbing than #pizzagate.  Search hellstorm - the genocide of nazi Germany,  and sort ya thinking out straight. </p></p>

        <p><p>This guy has been blasting this on Pizzagate posts, and although incredibly foolish sounding it has been getting upvotes. </p>
<p>I'm under the assumption this is a ruse to get people to think we are all nutzo theorists with no real reason to worry.</p>
<p>Up vote this for awareness and post things like I have here if you suspect it here or elsewhere if it wreaks of that to you as well.</p></p>

        <p><p>Not sure about the Hitler part. Pretty sure he did lots wrong, however I like the other stuff you wrote. Did you seriously vote for Hillary then find this all out in the last 2 weeks? Your head must've exploded. I learned about pedophilia ring after that British Seville guy was caught. David Icke has lots of videos on this. </p></p>

        <p><p>I am going to go as crazy as Kanye. I didn't know any of this stuff ever existed. You can go to fucking Harvard and be taught the same lie as in middleschool. My FUCKING GOD. I am literally going to do everything imaginably possible to end these people. I don't fucking care what it takes. I'll try to convince my father. He is a genius, but this is too far out for him to get to. I'm going to have to do this on my own. </p></p>

        <p><p>Jew here, the holocaust definitely didn't happen like they teach us, EVERYTHING we've learned in K-12 education is fabricated to suit their agenda. Going to be hard for people to unlearn everything they've ever known to be true, that's the whole point of Tavistock, to polarize our minds into subdued complacency.</p></p>

        <p><p>I know that I am not ready to believe all of this yet, but I do definitely believe there are a handful of very powerful people in this world that control basically everything.  Just ask yourself why our money (and most of the money in the world) isn't backed up by gold anymore??  Look at what Gadhafi was trying to do before he got killed.  There is so much disinformation these days that it is hard to tell what is true and what isn't... but you have to keep in mind that the powerful people are the ones spreading the lies through the MSM.</p>
<p>I will read through your pdf when I have more time, and I will go into it with an open mind... not saying it will convince me that Hitler was a good guy, but I will read it.</p>
<p>Here is video 1 of a series that I think sums up what you are saying: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bddH5vA9kCU</p></p>

        <p><p>And still no denial or refutation of 99% of the allegations. They're waiting to see how quietly contained (or, now, contained to the realm of crazy alt-right conspiracy theory) they can keep the story. </p></p>

        <p><p>Annoying when I see comments like "Oh those pedo Clintons," or "those pedo dems." Obv. it would go outside party lines. People who assume DC is this perfectly shrink wrapped high school cafeteria of cliques that never communicate is so irritatingly stupid and shallow thinking.. </p></p>

        <p><p>Liberals thought Obama was their hero, the one man who would go into Washington and single-handedly overthrow centuries of entrenched corruption/shadow government with his sheer liberal will.</p>
<p>I think Trump is the right's version of this cowboy hero, and I think there will be a similar disillusionment when he doesn't change much, other than something marginal and very public like Obamacare was.</p>
<p>But I see this as part of a larger "plan" which is that once both sides of the country have had their political dreams crushed completely and sold down the river, they will be united in the next election to choose someone actually legit, like a Bernie Sanders or Ron Paul candidate.</p></p>

        <p><p>Trump isn't the right's Obama. He didn't win because he inspired many with his message of hope and change, he won because a lot of Dems and Independents didn't vote. They would've rathered Trump win to finally put the nail in the coffin to the establishment. Progressives are taking over the Democratic party and next election will be won in a landslide by any true progressive candidate that chooses to run.</p>
<p>The 4 years of chaos that Trump brings will finally allow people to unite and stand together. Only then can we accomplish true change and progress.</p></p>

        <p><p>Prove anything. People here seemed convinced of what they believe (no surprise, that's what we all do) but none of it is proven. If all these people are in on it, why not Trump? He's rich. He hangs in the same circles. He's been on The Plane. If these people control everything, then they controlled this election and made Trump the winner. Who the fuck knows? He likes to hang out in the dressing rooms of young girls, he said he'd fuck his daughter and she was underage. What more do you need?</p></p>

He is a politician now, don't be surprised when what's coming out of his mouth does not match his actions. Maybe he'll surprise me. But I doubt it.</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>Soon this dam will bust wide open.</p>

<p>and TPTB that tried to shove Hillary down our throats are going to have her to thank for whatever sht falls on them.  It was her cavalier attitude toward security in conjunction with CF's corporatizing the business of child sex trafficking that threatens TPTB anonymity.  </p>
<p>The Clintons didn't just make the power structure vulnerable to external threat via public awareness.  The Clintons corroded the collective internal compass of TPTB.  The Clintons eased access.  The Clintons seem to have a gift for "making certain actions seem OK".  They're excellent justifiers.  The Clinton gift seems to be getting people to talk themselves into questionable behavior.</p></p>

        <p><p>Here is the thing, and I hope it doesn't go down like this, but...</p>
<p>Comet Pizza has likely destroyed all evidence if there was any. Those tunnels we saw them digging, those are filled. We know from previous failed DC pedo investigations that the FBI refused to investigate because key men of power in the FBI were complicit in some way. So we do not have the FBI on our side, if anything it's smart to prepare a defense against them.</p>
<p>What I am hoping for is that the Dead Man's Switch has some nasty shit on these people that makes it irrefutable to the public.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is some <em>scary</em> shit. Along with google and the government working together to ban all "fake news", I hope people here realize now just how truly horrible the United States government is. These people are not our friends, they actively work against us, and they are not here for our best interests. They never have been and they never will be. This is quickly going to become a "when the many stop fearing the few" scenario and it's about time someone lights a fire under their asses and it's pretty clear to me pizzagate is making someone in a higher seat real worried.</p></p>

<p>is this an attempt to condition people to not believe what might ultimately be revealed about some very prolific people?</p></p>

        <p><p>Absolutely. It's almost certainly a CIA propaganda operation. Ever since the "fake news" epidemic started, people in all the "news" related subs now refuse to believe <em>anything</em> unless it's reported by the MSM. </p>
<p>I'm pretty sure Hillary Clinton itself could walk into a family's home, steal their kids and disappear through the chimney and the family wouldn't believe it happened until they saw it on CNN.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah? That's cute. Remember that when the government decides for you that you're not allowed to read anything that isn't a MSM source. That way, it doesn't matter if they're lying to you or not and they can be sure that nothing you believe is true.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, the whole fake news push is very hard for me to ignore. If it had come during the last month or so before the election it would've been less glaring. On the other hand, perhaps this is just a poorly timed and quasi-retarded final desperate try at restoring their credibility/audience.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think it is their reaction to the Podesta emails on Wieners laptop. They knew what was in them so they had to come up with an excuse. I do recall right before the election there was an announcement from them saying that some really bad stuff was going to come out, but to not believe it. </p>
<p>I immediately started wondering what that would be and then the NYPD story hit and I knew what it was. I had no idea it would be this big, this story keeps growing and growing. </p></p>

        <p><p>I remember a year ago when I was ardently wishing for some dense movie or novel, some ultra-dark, quasi-political, hugely complex, seemingly bottomless labyrinthian mystery. It'd be awesome in fiction, but it's proving to be not-so-awesome in real life. </p></p>

        <p><p>I just rewatched Made in USA and I've been thinking about that character who's writing a novel that will never end. A Song of Ice and Fire is currently unfinished. You may very well be right.</p></p>

        <p><p>There are many many good honest people in the FBI, CIA, NSA and in congress as well as state and local levels.  Many.  I understand your frustration believe me but "government " is not one entity.  It's comprised of many individuals at many levels.  Shit they can't even deliver the mail on time.</p>
<p>It is true however that there is rampant corruption in the government.  That I will agree with 100%</p></p>

        <p><p>No, it isn't. Take this part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some have responded that the sketches are only representations of one person. This is false. Initially reports indicated just one suspect, but it has grown to potentially as many as six. As confirmed by the BBC. The newest images can be seen on the Find Madeiline campaign.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only existing record are that the sketches are of a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/madeleine-mccann-latest-are-police-any-closer-to-knowing-the-tru/">single person</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mary and Martin Smith, from Ireland, told police they saw a man carrying a child matching Madeleine’s description at around 10pm on Rua da Escola Primaria, 500 yards from the McCanns’ apartment. He was heading towards the beach, did not look like a tourist and did not seem comfortable carrying the child, they said.</p>
<p>Their evidence was compelling, but it was only in October 2013 that two e-fit images of the man, compiled by police from descriptions given by Mr and Mrs Smith, were released by Scotland Yard to coincide with a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction of Madeleine’s disappearance. He remains a suspect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Filmpolice's insistence on continuing the speculation that these sketches are of two people when the only actual evidence says that these pictures are of the same person makes me very suspicious as to his motives, along with his repeated history of posting this article that he clearly wrote with such text as "if this gets downvoted the sub has been compromised", makes me think he is either a disinfo troll or simply someone promoting themselves for web traffic. His only argument back has been rationalization that the pictures MUST be of the Podestas because he says so. Such speculative nonsense reeks of trying to throw us off the right trail.</p></p>

        <p><p>You have no leg to stand on. It is obvious to anyone who carefully examines the composites that they are a match; the match is so striking that it is plausible to suppose that it is an attempt internally by police to out the Podestas because they were prevented from making an arrest. </p>
<p>Your only response is "but the official narrative said that someone said that it was only one person, therefore they must be right and the match must be dismissed!"</p>
<p>Using the "just one person" story to dismiss everything has been addressed repeatedly and debunked. It is inaccurate and based on fallacious epistemological presuppositions. </p>
<p>You have yet to provide a rational, substantive argument to defend your debunked soundbites.</p>
<p>Repeating it over and over again and declaring victory does not count as an argument. </p>
<p>The claim is this (or something close to this): the police sketches can't possibly match the Podesta brothers, because according to the official narrative witnesses told the police there was only one suspect, and the sketches were based on this witness testimony cited in the official narrative.</p>
<p>Snippets of wikipedia are often provided in an attempt to make the claim seem legitimate. </p>
<p>There are two reasons why the claim has been debunked.</p>
<p><strong><em>First</em></strong>, it is not entirely accurate. Police did not <em>conclude with certainty</em> that there was just one suspect; far from it, they only tacitly <em>believed</em> there was one suspect based on preliminary reports. Here is the <a href="https://i.sli.mg/be4NrS">exact language they used.</a></p>
<p>And it is only right that they should use language of belief rather than certain proof, for that is how rational inquiry works.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the <strong><em>second</em></strong> (and more damaging) problem with the claim. </p>
<p>Due to the <em>inductive</em> nature of police investigations, initial suppositions based on preliminary reports can always be revised in light of newer evidence.  If new evidence emerges suggesting that more than one suspect was involved, the original accounts would be revised. It would be contrary to the spirit of rational inquiry to maintain that preliminary reports have absolute, dogmatic veto power over any forthcoming evidence.</p>
<p>And that is indeed what we have here. The <em>empirical</em> resemblance of both Podesta brothers — down to the mole above the eyebrow — outweighs the <em>mere supposition</em> that there may have been only one suspect.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/lU1eaN">Here is a diagram showing that even the smallest details match</a> -- such as the depression marks on the ridge of John's nose which would be caused by wearing glasses long-term, as well as the mole above Tony's eyebrow, the skin complexion, the 5 O’clock shadow facial hair, the distance between the eyes, the facial contours and symmetry, etc. </p>
<p>In order to continue maintaining this idea that the sketches must be automatically dismissed, you must (a) take the police statement out of context and attribute to them a much stronger claim than they actually made. They did not say it was <em>conclusive</em>, but that they <em>believed</em> there was one suspect. The language of belief rather than certainty is typical because investigators want to remain open to future evidence.  Stop trying to pigeonhole them for your own agenda. </p>
<p>And you must (b) grant dogmatic status to preliminary reports so that any future evidence must be dismissed no matter how empirically compelling it is -- which is just bad epistemology. From the fact that initial reports suggested only one suspect, it does not follow that those reports are gospel and can be used to automatically rule out any newer evidence, especially when the latter is quite powerful on its own. </p>
<p>(To use a crude example, it used to be a deeply held and widely shared belief that the universe was static. It wasn't until observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation and other phenomena that cosmologists came to the unbelievable conclusion that spacetime itself is expanding. Now most everybody takes big bang cosmology for granted, but imagine if we had clung to the static view simply because it was "what the original astronomers said!")</p>
<p>Preliminary reports can always be open to revision when they are outweighed by newer, more compelling empirical evidence. </p>
<p>In short, it is both factually inaccurate and epistemologically problematic to continue claiming that the sketches must be dismissed out of hand based on preliminary reports.</p></p>

        <p><p>It has not been debunked. Not a single other source has updated the descriptions of the sketches to reflect that they are actually of multiple men. This is supposed to be based on evidence, not speculative theorizing about the changing scope of existing evidence.</p></p>

        <p><p>You completely failed to address any of the specifics and the details. It is painfully obvious now. We do have existing evidence in the form of matching composites; to say it isn't real is ludicrous; to say that preliminary reports have veto power over hard empirical evidence is intellectually irresponsible and investagatively worthless. </p>
<p>Repeating yourself over and over and refusing to engage the details is not an argument. </p></p>

        <p><p>Filmpolice, you're exactly right on this one. For better or worse, I'm still deeply skeptical about the efit sketches; even if we grant that they are of two people, or if the resemblance were even more striking, still, by itself, that would be inconclusive; on the other hand, even if we grant it's of only one person, the point of these sketches is to find people who resemble them. In other words, even if I were entirely innocent, if a sketch was released that looked as much like me as these do like the Podestas, I would already be on my front porch waiting for the authorities to arrive and bring me in for questioning, whether or not there was some dispute about the number of suspects or sketches or whatever.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean. My interest is keeping this investigation fact-based and free of speculation. Filmpolice wants to make it entirely about his speculation.</p></p>

        <p><p>Okay, take the second picture out. The first one is John Podesta unless he has an identical twin in Portugal. When I first saw the sketches I immediately debunked it in my mind as someone trolling. But just to be sure, I searched for old stories to prove these weren't real sketches. Boy, was I surprised to find out they were real. Then when I saw the Fox story stating investigators knew who he was but couldn't make an arrest because of "international law" it confirmed it for me. If John Doe America was found to be the suspect, you better believe he would have been extradited and charged. The ONLY explanation is immunity for high level officials. All this stuff is way beyond me anyway. I'm just happy there are others trying to bring this to light despite the obvious dangers. All the while I get to read along with a live version of the most fascinating mystery/thriller novel of all time. And here I thought non-fiction was boring. </p></p>

        <p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>No, it's not the only speculation. America and Portugal have had an extradition treaty for over a century, so "international law" would not stand in the way of charging an American with crimes. It's just as likely that whomever the person is occupies a position with diplomatic immunity, and while this does apply to numerous top officials in governments all around the world, it does not necessarily apply to John Podesta. Does it look like him? Yes, you bet your ass it does. And the second picture looks like Tony Podesta. But my perception and your perception of sketches stated on-the-record to be of one man do not count as evidence, no matter how much we may not like it. If this is to be an actual, fact-based investigation, we have understand the difference between hard, unarguable facts and our collective opinions. The former will indict. The latter will not.</p></p>

<p>No, the pictures are very probably the Podestas because the likeness is extreme, down to a mark above the left eye. </p>
<p>It could be yet another coincidence (coincidence #1,539 710) that we are told to accept if we are to believe that we live in a safe womb/state. </p></p>

        <p><p>It could be them. I am not disputing the number of actual suspects. I am disputing that the sketches have been proven to be of more than one suspect. The only records e have say they are of the same person. Do we operate on evidence or speculation?</p></p>

        <p><p>You have no evidence for only-one-person, though you are dishonestly claiming to have such evidence. </p>
<p>The pictures are very different: they are of two different people, regardless of whatever you say. </p>
<p>I think </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>that you operate on speculation, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>other people are doing what they can with evidence and extreme likelihood/un-likelihood </p>
</li>

<p>you assert that others' grounded statements are "speculation" when they become inconvenient. </p>

        <p><p>I've posted my evidence nearly 20 times on this damned sub: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/madeleine-mccann-latest-are-police-any-closer-to-knowing-the-tru/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mary and Martin Smith, from Ireland, told police they saw <strong>a man</strong> carrying a child matching Madeleine’s description at around 10pm on Rua da Escola Primaria, 500 yards from the McCanns’ apartment. He was heading towards the beach, did not look like a tourist and did not seem comfortable carrying the child, they said.</p>
<p>Their evidence was compelling, but it was only in October 2013 that two e-fit images of the <strong>man</strong>, compiled by police from descriptions given by Mr and Mrs Smith, were released by Scotland Yard to coincide with a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction of Madeleine’s disappearance. <strong>He remains a suspect</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not interested in your baseless character assassinations. The pictures are on the record as being of a single man. Regardless of what you may think, no proof has been provided that shows that the pictures are of two different men.</p></p>

        <p><p>If the site went offline as more and more people started hitting it, it was more likely a resources issues that they resolved. If not, and they were able to take down the site without a notice or DDoS, are you implying that the government was able to literally take control of that web server(s) and shut it down? If its hosted, that means they can access servers on AWS, Azure, etc. ? You should hit up their admin and ask whether the server crashed and needed to be brought back up, or if something far more nefarious happened. </p></p>

<p>edit: I really wish people would not post that Jeffery Dahmer photo though, or have a very serious warning. It's maybe the most disturbing image I've ever seen in my life, and I've accidentally seen it like five times now, which is five too many tbh. You could describe the image and then people who really want to see it could search for it, etc.</p></p>

        <p><p>They are just further incriminating themselves. We are exponentially gaining more followers both on this thread, and in the under ground. Soon it will be too big for the media to ignore. Or the people protesting outside of their doors will be louder than the news. We should all feel a great sense of satisfaction knowing we are assisting with this oh so necessary paradigm shift. Every time you see a disturbing picture realize that you are literally preventing that from happening in the future. I am honored to be amongst all of you. Many of us have dedicated our entire lives to the awakening. Do not fear. I truly love all of you :)</p></p>

        <p><p>Probably removed it because they didn't want to be responsible for slander of a politician based on your very loose "facts".</p>
<p>Are you the same guy that was ignoring all the evidence that went against your theory that John and Tony podesta <em>personally</em> went to abduct Madeline McCann? Yeah it was you. You were constantly ignoring the fact that these sketches were two different witnesses describing a singular sighting of one person (You address this in the article by saying there is now more suspects - THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT THESE WITNESSES ARE DESCRIBING THE SAME PERSON THEY SAW AT THE SAME TIME - HOW CAN YOU KEEP IGNORING THIS?!). Ignoring the fact that the second image is just a fat guy and looks nothing like Tony. Also ignoring the fact that there are many, many cases of Tony not having sent any emails and having an assistant cover for him.. because he's a travelling politician.</p>
<p>The rest of your facts in this article are fine, and not related to Maddy McCann in any way whatsoever. </p>
<p>So you are sat their, implying: "This guy who travels all the time, happened to be travelling at the same time that the most high-profile abduction of the last 20 years happened. He kinda looks like one of the two sketches, so it <em>must</em> be him."</p>
<p>You want to believe. You were specifically not mentioning arguments that had been made against your theory when you brought it to us, because they don't line up with your narrative. You reiterate your already debunked arguments, and you are making the whole movement look stupid.</p></p>

        <p><p>/u/cky_stew does fail to mention that John Podesta's emails have an unexplained 6-month gap that ends the <em>day after the abduction</em>.  Also, while the police claim they believe the sketches are of the same person, we don't know if that's true.  The sketches look quite different from each other, and look exactly like the Podestas, and could be the investigators' way of issuing a warning to the Podestas (remember they said they know who did it, but their hands are tied).</p>
<p>However, /u/cky_stew does have a point.  I don't think he's a shill.  There is a sort of game of "telephone" happening with the McCann case.  For example, I have seen comments where users said that we know the Podestas were in Portugal at the time.  No, we don't know that at all, so spreading that claim only discredits us. </p></p>

        <p><p>My "reason" is the entire content of the post you just replied to, fancy addressing any of that before just jumping to the conclusion (seems to be a running theme in this thread) that I'm a shill?</p>
<p>If you think I'm a shill, please check my account history.</p>
<p>I am totally in support of people investigating pizzagate, and I read a lot of conspiracy theories, but this guy is making the entire sub look stupid by speculating such ridiculous scenarios based on such little evidence. </p>
<p>If anything, he's the shill, discrediting the movement. I'm just calling him on his bullshit, are we not allowed to do that in this echo chamber?</p></p>

        <p><p>Here's the thing.  People are taking this way too far.  People are sending threats and making angry phone calls based on conjecture.  It may be best just to work with the FBI, to see if there something to all of this.  That may need to occur after 1/20...</p></p>

        <p><p>Guys, please push for this until the story breaks. If we stop this all goes away.</p>
<p>And try to stick to facts. If there are obvious clues and hints investigate them instead of touting them as evidence. And keep conspiracies out of this. This is an investigation.</p>
<p>We are investigating what appears to be an conspiracy, but we don't need to say that. We just need to show what we find.</p></p>

        <p><p>I have to say, I'm quite worried that Filmpolice has been made a mod after he was best known for perpetrating the "police sketches of Madeline McCann suspect were of the Podestas" lie when repeated citations of the fact that the sketches were of a single person went unaddressed by him. This is doubly disturbing considering that here he is, posting the same claim again. This is not the first time he's tried to draw traffic to his own written articles that make the same claim, as well.</p>
<p>On what basis was he made a mod?</p></p>

        <p><p>Nothing in that response is proof of anything except your own personal reasoning, which is not evidence of anything. The only evidence in existence referring to those sketches explicitly states they're of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/madeleine-mccann-latest-are-police-any-closer-to-knowing-the-tru/">one man</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mary and Martin Smith, from Ireland, told police they saw a man carrying a child matching Madeleine’s description at around 10pm on Rua da Escola Primaria, 500 yards from the McCanns’ apartment. He was heading towards the beach, did not look like a tourist and did not seem comfortable carrying the child, they said.</p>
<p>Their evidence was compelling, but it was only in October 2013 that two e-fit images of the man, compiled by police from descriptions given by Mr and Mrs Smith, were released by Scotland Yard to coincide with a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction of Madeleine’s disappearance. He remains a suspect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have yet to provide ANY evidence to counter this basic fact other than variations of you saying "nuh uh". Finding citations of there being more than one suspect does not change the fact that the sketches were of one person. That you refuse to at least acknowledge this unarguable rationale makes me very, very suspicious of your reasons for participating in this sub. At the very least, you are detracting from any evidence-based investigation and pushing speculation over verification. It's shameful and will ultimately undermine our goal.</p></p>

        <p><p>You have yet to provide a rational, substantive argument to defend your debunked soundbites.</p>
<p>Repeating it over and over again and declaring victory does not count as an argument. </p>
<p>The claim is this (or something close to this): the police sketches can't possibly match the Podesta brothers, because witnesses told the police there was only one suspect, and the sketches were based on this witness testimony.</p>
<p>Snippets of wikipedia are often provided in an attempt to make the claim seem legitimate. </p>
<p>There are two reasons why the claim has been debunked.</p>
<p><strong><em>First</em></strong>, it is not entirely accurate. Police did not <em>conclude with certainty</em> that there was just one suspect; far from it, they only tacitly <em>believed</em> there was one suspect based on preliminary reports. Here is the <a href="https://i.sli.mg/be4NrS">exact language they used.</a></p>
<p>And it is only right that they should use language of belief rather than certain proof, for that is how rational inquiry works.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the <strong><em>second</em></strong> (and more damaging) problem with the claim. </p>
<p>Due to the <em>inductive</em> nature of police investigations, initial suppositions based on preliminary reports can always be revised in light of newer evidence.  If new evidence emerges suggesting that more than one suspect was involved, the original accounts would be revised. It would be contrary to the spirit of rational inquiry to maintain that preliminary reports have absolute, dogmatic veto power over any forthcoming evidence.</p>
<p>And that is indeed what we have here. The <em>empirical</em> resemblance of both Podesta brothers — down to the mole above the eyebrow — outweighs the <em>mere supposition</em> that there may have been only one suspect.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/lU1eaN">Here is a diagram showing that even the smallest details match</a> -- such as the depression marks on the ridge of John's nose which would be caused by wearing glasses long-term, as well as the mole above Tony's eyebrow, the skin complexion, the 5 O’clock shadow facial hair, the distance between the eyes, the facial contours and symmetry, etc. </p>
<p>In order to continue maintaining this idea that the sketches must be automatically dismissed, you must (a) take the police statement out of context and attribute to them a much stronger claim than they actually made. They did not say it was <em>conclusive</em>, but that they <em>believed</em> there was one suspect. The language of belief rather than certainty is typical because investigators want to remain open to future evidence.  </p>
<p>And you most (b) grant dogmatic status to preliminary reports so that any future evidence must be dismissed no matter how empirically compelling it is -- which is just bad epistemology. From the fact that initial reports suggested only one suspect, it does not follow that those reports are gospel and can be used to automatically rule out any newer evidence, especially when the latter is quite powerful on its own. </p>
<p>(To use a crude example, it used to be a deeply held and widely shared belief that the universe was static. It wasn't until observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation and other phenomena that cosmologists came to the unbelievable conclusion that spacetime itself is expanding. Now most everybody takes big bang cosmology for granted, but imagine if we had clung to the static view simply because it was "what the original astronomers said!")</p>
<p>In short, it is both factually inaccurate and epistemologically problematic to continue claiming that the sketches must be dismissed out of hand based on preliminary reports.</p></p>

        <p><p>Your leaps of logic do not evidence make; this investigation is supposed to be based on hard evidence. Your continued insistence that your suppositions are unarguable continues to make me believe your motives here are distraction and disinformation. Again: feel free to prove me wrong with any updated account regarding the sketches. Insisting that they are proven to be of more than one man is demonstrably false.</p></p>

        <p><p>You completely failed to address <em>any</em> of the specifics and the details. It is painfully obvious now. </p>
<p>Calling something a "leap of logic" is not an actual argument. </p>
<p>Asserting the same thing over and over does not make it an argument. </p>
<p>It has been made abundantly clear that you are attributing a stronger claim to the police than the one they actually made, and that you are operating on flimsy epistemological presuppositions that have no basis in rational inquiry. </p>
<p>All you can do is play assert-n'-run now. It is intellectually worthless, and you are wasting your time now. </p></p>

        <p><p>It is like Galileo telling people to look at the telescope, and he refusing to look into the telescope because what it shows contradicts what he has been told. Except that what he has been told is not even considered "hard proof", just speculation.</p></p>
