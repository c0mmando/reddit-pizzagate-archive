        <strong>Paedophilia and corruption on a massive and incomprehensible scale</strong>
        <p><p>Not directly linked to the US, but worth checking out in order to get a feel for the scope of the problem.</p>
<p>Who has the power to orchestrate a surreal and brutal battle of authorities (police, intelligence services, social services, politicians, hospitals, etc.) in 3 countries against a couple for reporting a paedophile linked to the Royal Family ?</p>
<p>The Brutal Protection Of Paedophiles (Full Interview David Scott With Janice &amp; Brian Docherty) at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jat6wPf_KSM Full transcript (pdf) including photographs and additional documents at: https://is.gd/VSCSEZ (link source: first line of video description)</p>
<p>Unless Scottish/Irish I suggest to read the pdf because of the accents as well as specific names of authorities and services (that are explained with footnotes in the pdf document).</p>
<p>Posted to r/conspiracy as well.</p></p>

        <p><p>If and when this thread stumbles upon the truth, (possibly of the Rothschild nature) I suspect we will all be in deep shit. Until then; fight on brother! Keep digging!</p></p>
