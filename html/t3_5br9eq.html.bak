        <strong>Realtor in the Handkerchief wikileak possibly pizza related?</strong>
        <p><p>the wikileak: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/23561</p>
<p>So the map/handkerchief business is suspicious, I looked a little more into the realtor, Kathryn Tate, to see how legit she is...</p>
<p>So I tired to go to her site her email comes from: http://www.ktate.com/ but its blank but we have thewaybackmachine:</p>
<p>http://web.archive.org/web/20100218141605/http://www.ktate.com/</p>
<p>the page is just a billboard for interior decorating. but this page reveals something interesting... her email is a little different than what is in the wikileaks. it's not kathy@ktate.com it is kate@ktate.com</p>
<p>So I did a case sensitive google image search for the address and it turned up two images attached to a google+ account:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22kate%40ktate.com%22&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS663US663&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAlNb7pZjQAhUQ1GMKHTN5Ar4Q_AUICCgD">search results</a></p>
<p>One is the default image and the other a lady with some <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_j3F4DGHyw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ehGa3sh7iRg/photo.jpg">pizza related image?</a>... I think it's safe to assume the right is Kate... her relation to the pizza is questionable. I could just be a family member? But what makes it odd is if you go to the g+ profile page the pizza related image is no where to be found... as if someone deleted/wants to hide it but google image search caught it somehow.</p></p>

        <p><p>kathy vs kate email addresses may be for sorting mail, ie business-to-business for one, business-to-client for the other. It's also possible that Kathy and Kate are two different people.</p>
<p>The girls in the duck face selfie appear too young to be running their own business. I would guess that the pic is no longer in the G+ profile because it's a shit quality duck face selfie.</p>
<p>Doesn't look like this is much of anything.</p></p>
