        <strong>The Donald mega thread post</strong>
        <p><p>You know they're doing this to avoid having all of that on the Donald?  It is a way to censor it without appearing to censor it.  They deleted the threads about Kanye west thst came up today.  It shows they are compromised because they want an excuse to delete all of those posts </p></p>

        <p><p>Same thing happened in r/politics when Comey said he had new evidence. One single megathread, delete everything else on the topic, and then unstick the megathread so it stops showing on the front page.</p></p>

        <p><p>Maybe it's so Obama won't pardon these people on his way out. He wants them to get all cozy before he throws them all behind bars forever</p></p>
