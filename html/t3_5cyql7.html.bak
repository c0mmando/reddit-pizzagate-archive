        <strong>Pedo Rings Are Real</strong>
        <p><p>For anyone that may be thinking this whole Pizzagate Thing is based on a highly active imagination, the concept is not.</p>
<p>I lived in Tampa, Florida in 1992. I started dating this girl, and after a few weeks, she brought me to meet the family. Dad's live-in girlfriend was 18 years old (younger than my GF). After several times to the house, a group of "friends" showed up, all with kids (ages between about 8 and 12 and almost all girls). There was to be a sleepover that night. There were about twenty kids in all. The kids all got ready for bed that evening, and then to my surprise, they all lined up (in their underwear) and took turns sitting on my lap and hugging me. I kind of freaked a little, but all the moms were right there, so I didn't think too much of it.</p>
<p>That night, a couple of the moms asked if I would go with two moms and all the kids to spend a weekend at some remote cabin one of them owned. I flirted with one of the moms, and said something to the effect of "Wow! In a cabin all weekend with two hot women......" She answered with "You'll have all you can handle!" I originally thought she was talking about a threesome, but it wasn't so.</p>
<p>They kept bringing the kids over to talk to me, and I overheard two moms in the yard talking about me "breaking in" the kids. It was at that point that I realized what they were doing. I made an excuse that I had a previous engagement that weekend, but maybe later. </p>
<p>Satanic? I honestly can't say. Pedos? Yes. The moms in question were also smoking hot. When I researched it at the time, I found the phrase "Flirty Fishing". Its how the old "The Family" or "Children of God" Cult Pedo Ring got new members. The women AND kids would lure men and women into having sex with them. Once you have screwed a kid, they have you for life. I don't know when "The Finders" was started, but this is absolutely real. I am only happy I was thinking with my big head instead of the smaller one!</p>
<p>[EDIT]
Shortly after, I had the opportunity to move back home to New Orleans, and used it as an excuse to break up with the GF. Never heard from nor saw any of them again</p></p>

        <p><p>ITS A JOKE! A joke I say. You see, back in the olden times, a bunch of Catholic Priests were caught buggering little boys and girls (mostly boys). THAT is why gaums made the "butthurt" J-O-K-E . Joke! Joke I say! You got the right HA HA, but the wrong Ho Ho.</p></p>

        <p><p>Honest answer?</p>
<p>A Christian's primary goal in life is to surrender to the will of God. <strong>Salvation comes through surrender.</strong></p>
<p>A Satanist/Setian's primary goal in life is to serve their own will. <strong>Deification comes through expanding the self.</strong></p>
<p>There are obviously a million other nuances and details within and between each of these views, but IMO it all boils down to those two primary differences. One view seeks to surrender to the universe; the other seeks to deny the universe's attempts to swallow it whole.</p>
<p>Edit: just to be clear, I'm not placing any judgement on either side here... but it's interesting that you can see these two general POVs echoed through numerous religions and philosophies of the world. Naturally, there are perversions on either side of the spectrum - I'm sure that there are bad Christians and good Satanists - and atheists, Muslims, etc. come in all flavors... The theological issue boils down to whose <em>will</em> each person places at the center of their spiritual universe - their own will, or that of a higher power.</p>
<p><strong>Consider two common sayings within each religion.</strong></p>
<p><em>Thy will be done.</em> (Christian)
<em>Do what thou wilt.</em> (Satanic)</p></p>

        <p><p>Eh, that's where it gets tricky and I'm honestly not any sort of expert here... perhaps a decade ago when I gave a shit. I'll give it a shot though:</p>
<p>While there's schisms within each side, they ultimately follow the same <em>general mythology</em>... which is to say that they don't believe in the Hindu or Greek gods persay.</p>
<p>But take the Setians vs the Satanists. Both place Satan/Set at the top of their religion, but Satanists worship Satan, while Setians view him as a mentor and spiritual guide. Setians also don't actually believe that God exists... rather, they believe that all gods are fabrications of man's imagination.</p>
<p>Now Setians also borrow some mythology from Egyptology... although beyond the fact that Set was an Egyptian god (Satan was apparently a bastardization of his true name), I'm not really sure what the significance of that is.</p>
<p>The Church of Satan had a number of schisms like this - as does the Christian Church - some of which read the Bible literally and others that take it metaphorically - and still others that recognize entirely other books as canonical source material. </p>
<p>I'm probably butchering a lot of this, but I hope that at least covers the basics. </p>
<p>TLDR; yeah, but it's complicated.</p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks for the personal story.  That is truly strange.  It seems we all agree with the idea that this pedo shit is how these people gain power over one another like you suggested.  It just occurred to me that if this is older than the age of personal cameras, how it would have worked then?  People keep bringing in "ancient" "occult" practices, but this strategy of seeking to control someone through blackmail could not have worked so well back then as it could now with how easy it would be to prove through film.  That is why I hope we continue to focus on the current, verifiable links people are digging up instead of bringing in old, religious, and frankly unverifiable conspiracies.</p></p>

        <p><p>The first patent for a "one way mirror" was in 1903. Before digital, there was film, all the way back to the 1920s. Before that? I think they probably just had witnesses. </p></p>

        <p><p>The blackmail thing is new.  The previous use for this stuff was to make the kids generational subservient, sort of a way of 'preserving the royal line' to make sure they are working toward accomplishing the goals set forth by the parents.  They abuse their kids.  Their kids then abuse their kids.  Perpetual.  This is why it's engrossed in the elites primarily.  It's mind control.  Break the kid when young.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think it could have worked just as well back in ancient times. All you had was the word of the person accusing and the word of the person accused. If you have multiple witnesses who say that the accused is a kiddy diddler, then you have the accused over a barrel. </p>
<p>To me, the connection to satanic ritual seems to be in the sacrifice and grooming of children. </p>
<p>I'm no expert. Pure speculation. I need to educate myself. This stuff makes me sick to my stomach. </p></p>

        <p><p>You should have used the World English Version of that Leviticus Quote:</p>
<p>""'You shall not give any of your children to sacrifice to Molech; neither shall you profane the name of your God: I am Yahweh."</p>
<p>For those that don't know, Molek was the God/idol that the Ammonites prayed to. They also sacrificed their children to Molek.</p></p>

        <p><p>Interesting story. It reminds me of a Cracked article i read that discussed the practices of Pedos on the deep web. (The author was infiltrating their chatrooms for prosecutorial purposes.)</p>
<p>Some pedos actually condition their own children to accept that Pedophilia/incest is normal and that they should enjoy it. Its very disturbing to read about their distorted view of reality.</p>
<p>(Admittedly Cracked has sucked for the past year and a half, but this article is interesting)</p>
<p>http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1760-5-things-i-learned-infiltrating-deep-web-child-molesters.html</p>
<p>From my own experience:
About 10 years ago, I sat in on a criminal proceeding to get a serial child rapist "sexual predator" status so he could remain incarcerated in a mental hospital for life, instead of being released after his time was served in prison.</p>
<p>He started raping other boys when he was young and continued into adulthood. His own accounts of these rapes were that he was "being nice" to them, and showing his "affection." He honestly didn't register the physical violence in his mind (according to the psychiatrist assigned to him)</p>
<p>Very disturbing, especially now that we know the scope that this is occurring. Thanks for sharing. Personal experiences help to shed light on these events that arent commonly experienced by other adults.</p></p>

        <p><p>I have warned a lot of people about flirty fishing. Imagine some seriously smoking hot woman/guy hitting on you. When things get hot and heavy, the ten year old daughter walks in and wants to join.</p>
<p>Being in the middle of sex, a LOT of guys would just say screw it, and let the little girl join in. After all, the girl's mom says she doesn't mind. Where's the problem. Until the blackmail starts. </p>
<p>The scenario above is how an investigator explained to me how they work. Sounds a lot like how Anon describes Jeff Epstein's Island. Get people there to engage in sex with little boys or girls. Get it all on tape, and they are pwned for life.</p></p>

        <p><p>LudditeLobotomist; Unfortunately, I have to say yes, they would. Once all the blood flows from their brains to their dicks, guys are easily compromised. I couldn't tell you the exact percentage, but I must have less faith in the goodness of humanity than you do. It may stem in part from me just watching a four part documentary on the Nazi German Einsatzkomandos (execution teams sent into their occupied territories to eradicate Jews and "untermenschen"). The Nazis didn't commit most of the murders (before the gas showers and ovens were built). Most were committed by local police and militias. These are people that knew the people they were beating to death and executing. Between stories like that and story after story of ISIL executing innocent people in the most horrendous ways possible, I just think more people than not would do something like that. </p>
<p>PS
A great analogy is the late comedian Patrice ONeal. In a bit on "Elephant in the Room", he was talking about men using dental dams. When he breaks it out, the woman asks him what's THAT for? When he tells her, the woman says "WHAT?" He balls it up and throws it away saying "I'd rather die than talk my way out of some pussy!" Unfortunately, MANY guys think the same way.</p></p>

        <p><p>Like I said to LudditeLobotomist, you obviously have more faith in human nature than I do.</p>
<p>The closest I came to that happening was, I was having sex with a woman, when her dog ran up to the bed and licked right up the crack of my ass. I think I probably jumped five feet in the air. Talk about losing wood! Nice dog!</p></p>

        <p><p>You're a little weird, and I don't know if what you were saying was hyperbole about blood leaving the brain and going to the penis, but that isn't how our biology works.  I also don't think a family, running a pedo ring, would invite their daughters new boyfriend of two weeks to their home to parade children around in front of.</p></p>

<p>At least he's halfway there and didn't go through with it, but his motivations are fucked, or this story is just total bullshit.</p></p>

        <p><p>While I'd like to think most guys would say know, the last few months of these leaks has made me lose so much faith in humanity that I don't know what the hell to think or believe anymore... I'm just in this perpetual state of disbelief and depression... truly sad to think that even 1 person would even consider going along with that :(  </p></p>

        <p><p>I saw they do this online too... That's the trick they'd use to arrest people found in chatrooms... they would have the 20 year old lead the guy on and get all flirty and sexy... then ask if their 17 year old sister could watch. The minor doesn't have to participate for you to be committing a crime... and even if you say no 100 times it only takes 1 yes to get implicated. </p></p>

        <p><p>No Battle would not have done that, or Battle would have been foolish.  </p>
<p>There are a ton of unknowns, but the biggest is not knowing how high things go. A simple perusal of pedo ring cases will show ANYBODY that sometimes the people you report things like that to are involved. Granted, at the time I wasn't thinking of that. I reported them to the cops. </p>
<p>Its easy to armchair quarterback what somebody did. I am a 6'4" 250 pound combat vet. I am not afraid to go toe to toe with any man that walks this Earth. I will say that creeped me out more than almost anything else in my life. Once I realized this was some kind of cult, is when I got creeped out. Also a bit scared. I just wanted to get away from the whole situation.</p></p>

        <p><p>"Flirty Fishing"     the Manson girls did the same thing. </p>
<p>It has been said the Manson Family was controled by the same satanic pedo ring in Hollywood. They had sent the family to kill Roman Polanski because Rosemary's Baby was made in an effort to expose them. The failed attempt to start a race war was part of it. (same as Soros is doing now)</p>
<p>Then Polanski was set up with an underage girl (who lied about her age to Polanski) by the same people. He fled prosecution, but he also fled for his LIFE. </p></p>

        <p><p>The reason they went to Polanski's House had nothing to do with Roman Polanski or Sharon Tate. Polanski was renting the house from a record executive (don't remember the name). Dennis Wilson (Beach Boys) was a friend of Manson's. Wilson brought Manson to meet the record executive for the exec to listen to Manson play his music, and possibly get a record deal. The exec didn't care for Manson's Music, and he didn't get signed. When it came time to start the race war "Helter Skelter", Manson liked the idea of killing the record exec that had turned him down. THAT is how Manson picked 10050 Cielo Dr W. I know his because a friend rented the house for a few years in the 1990s. Well, not THAT house. The original Polanski Murder Mansion was destroyed in 1979 (I think), because nobody would buy it with its history. In California, if someone was murdered in a house, it has to be disclosed to potential buyers. If you tear down the murder house and build something new, nobody has to say anything.</p>
<p>Polanski also was not set up. He knew the girl and her mom. Polanski liked younger women. He was/is screwed up in the head, because of what he went through with his family during the Holocaust (and also having his pregnant wife and child murdered in such horrible manner.</p></p>

<p>Polanski was in the Cult...of course he liked young women - they exposed him to the world after the failed murder attempt by the family. I recall he said the girl told him she was of legal age.   the mother was sent by the cult to set him up. not a stretch.</p>
<p>Also the beach boy stuff could just be part of the narrative of what they wanted you to believe.</p>
<p>Dennis died from mysterious circumstance... supposedly drowned but was a good swimmer </p>
<p>this new light on Occult Pedo rings makes me rethink the whole Natalie Wood death as well </p>
<p>I have done plenty of research on the manson case, even been to both murder scenes. </p>
<p>It was targeted. </p></p>

        <p><p>That's what makes this so difficult to find. To the untrained eye it doesn't look like abuse because  it's programmed to seam like normal behavior.  I'd guess a lot of them don't even feel like it's wrong. </p></p>

        <p><p>A lot of those people have grown up in those cults. Just look at the "Rene Guyon Society". Their motto is "Sex by eight, or else its too late." Don't believe me? Ugoogley it!</p></p>

        <p><p>One of my friends' families works rescuing people from sex trafficking and slavery, although mostly in third world countries. Unfortunately, the biggest surprise in all of this scandal for me is that there's enough people spending their time digging this up and caring about it, and finding stuff that might actually get them caught. (I assume the only reason people in first world countries almost never get caught is because they have enough money to get away with it.)</p>
<p>People are traded around like cattle every day. Large public airports are hotspots for the transportation. Nail salons and "massage" parlors are not uncommonly staffed with workers who have come to the country after being promised opportunity, only to be kept as slaves.</p>
<p>Especially in big cities, this stuff happens in front of people's eyes every day, and nobody has any idea.</p></p>

        <p><p>OP mentions "The Finders"<br>
Anyone not familiar with this case should have a read:
http://educate-yourself.org/cn/ciadrugsabusemurder.shtml</p>
<p>Basically back in the 80's,  Florida police found some abused children and some men holding them captive, and a bunch of material linking it to an apparent child trafficking operation in D.C.</p>
<p>They kept looking into it and eventually the friggin CIA stepped in and closed it down!</p>
<p>(here's a link to the scans of the official documents.  on Page 10, you see that the police report says the matter was taken over by the CIA and sealed)
https://www.scribd.com/doc/70996637/Finders-Cult</p>
<p>This shit has been going on for a long time.  It's all very real.</p></p>

        <p><p><em>The women AND kids would lure men and women into having sex with them.</em></p>
<p>I believe they are called "Sirens" or "Nymphs" - aka mermaids </p>
<p>they would seduce men to their deaths</p>
