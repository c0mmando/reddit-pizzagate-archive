        <strong>MKultra victim, I might be able to answer some questions.</strong>
        <p><p>With the links to MKultra that have been found lately i thought i might share what i know. I'm not gonna pretend like i know what they go through i can only speak from my own experience.</p>
<p>These people can be VERY dangerous, they wont go after you, they go after the people you care about. Also these people might not even know that its happening being mind control and whatnot (the people they use it on).</p>
<ul>
<li>blackmail is a huge part of it, we know this.</li>
<li>they target people (children) so they can use them later on, politics or whatever.</li>
<li>they are into some really dark shit, they use this for the mind control.</li>
<li>The adoption agencies, might be a big part of it.</li>
<li>If you try and go against them, it can go bad. They make you feel trapped.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know alot about the whys but I'm glad this is now becoming known, I don't think they can stop it at this point.</p></p>

        <p><p>Can you tell us more about your experience with mindcontrol? </p>
<p>Also how did you find out about this reddit and what is your opinion on how to move forward on this subject.</p></p>

<p>I've been into conspiracies since 9/11 basically.</p></p>

        <p><p>The worship / occult is mostly done to keep you from talking, keep you into the inner circle and also used for blackmail.</p>

        <p><p>No, you're not. What have you felt, how do you know? You can't just come in here claiming your an MKUltra victim and only give little sentences to support it. Talk about your experiences, are you confused, when did it first happen, how did you know that's what it was?</p></p>

        <p><p>I know, i should have put more detail, but these things arnt easy to talk about, stuff i really don't want to remember. I didn't know until recently or rather have some sort of confirmation. Random people who I've never met before seem to know things about me, stuff I've never mentioned to anyone.</p>
<p>These things that they believe in, bohemian grove ect, are quite real and not a "belief". when i first realized what was happening yes i was confused, it made no sense, i fell right into their plan, aggression. maybe that's why they love conflict so much.</p>
<p>This goes way deeper then most of you realize, someone has shown you this already, at great risk. I really don't want to withhold the truth, but there's no knowing what would happen, if I told you. You guys have found it already but seem to have overlooked it. </p>

        <p><p>I've read it described, but perhaps I didn't give it the attention it deserved. IIRC it's something like the child's soul dissociates under extreme stress/torture and the archons feed on it while it's away from the body.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't want to be accused of "Blood Libel" (look that phrase up seriously) but I am starting to come to the conclusion that this is related to Judaism specifically the "Talmud"(Look that up as well) but also in the Old Testament. Do Jews perform Child Sacrifice in the Bible? YES THEY DID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This isn't accusing every Jewish person of course but I certainly believe this child sacrifice stuff comes from an age old practice performed but certain Jewish Tribes.</p></p>

        <p><p>I honestly think there is a very strong connection to some Jews and occult practices and satanic worship. Anton Levy started the Church of Satan and he was of Jewish blood. Some Jews hate Jesus and Christianity altogether the Talmud claims Jesus is boiling in hell in human excrement. They detest what is good and right. Can you tell me why the Jews have been exiled 109 times?</p></p>

        <p><p>What was your earliest experience with MK Ultra style programming?</p>
<p>How did you get involved, in the first place?</p>
<p>Are your parents alive?</p>
<p>Do you have any type of dissociative disorder?</p>
<p>What types of mind altering substances have you consumed? Did you consume them willfully?</p></p>

        <p><p>nothing, its extremely subtle, i didnt realize till much later.</p>
<p>i didnt join.</p>
<p>yes.</p>
<p>not really, but it not easy to comprehend once you've learnt stuff.</p>
<p>Just regular stuff, no heavy psychedelics or anything.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well, based on my understanding of how MK Ultra works, I would say that causing a dissociative state in the formative years is the first step to determine capability, suggestibility and potential purposes. If you are not capable, suggestable or have a potential use, I would not understand why it would continue.</p>
<p>George Soros revealed in his emails that by using "othering" you can manipulate the implicit bias in people. This is an example of what I would consider "subtle" mind control, in that most people don't even understand those terms, let alone be willing to admit they are susceptible.</p>
<p>What subtle mind control have you experienced?</p></p>

        <p><p>"Othering" is some crazy shit -- it's just in-group vs out-group, but it's powerful. I've seen a whole group's reality change radically over 2-3 minutes when the person telling a story flipped from out-group to in-group or vice versa. We experience life through filters, and I guess friend vs foe is one of the most basic.</p>
<p>I assume that's what he's talking about?</p></p>

        <p><p>MKULTRA is just one program out of several that the military and intelligence agencies have implemented mind control studies in. The one specifically called MKULTRA was closed in the 70's. Some others go by names Project Artichoke, Project Monarch and Oak Tree. All of these government programs used (and still use) a platform of trauma training that was borrowed from occult sources and has been practiced for ages in some secretive circles and affluent families.</p>
<p>I'm not a victim of any government related mind control but i am a survivor of occult/ritual abuse at the hands of my parents and family friends and i do have DID. The dissociative aspect is the entire goal of the methodology. There is literally no other way for an infant or small child to surivive the living hell that is forced upon them without mentally fracturing to compartmentalise the memories. </p>
<p>I posed the question if you have DID and don't have an answer yet but from what i am reading i am gathering that you don't? So what i am wondering is, how did you escape a program that is designed to create dissocitaive states and are not effected? What age were you? Who were the perpetrators (group, not specific individuals)? Do you have memories of exactly what was done to you?</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not sure, possibly, I've never looked into DID before. I don't really remember much when I was young, the things I do don't make sense. </p>
<p>I don't know who is doing it, i have some ideas, its probably more than one group. I had no idea until a few years ago, I learned some things and at that point I became resistant, I fought back, and they have been basically relentless since then still to this day.</p></p>
