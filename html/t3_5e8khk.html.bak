        <strong>Guys, am I the only who thinks they may try to shut down this sub?</strong>
        <p><p>The recent site shutdowns are very suspicious, plus we know Sam Altman's position against Trump and he is very very pro-Clinton and hosted a number of events for her. He was the interim CEO and owns a large stake in Reddit.</p>
<p>I think our days are numbered. I wish I am proven wrong.</p></p>

        <p><p>If the cracks in this dam get any bigger, screw reddit....they will shut down the entire internet.  At this point it's like 1 out of every 5 people are involved in this.</p></p>

        <p><p>The New York Times and snopes both just published and article on pizzagate and hour ago. NYT specifically mentioned Reddit and the_Donald. They are definitely trying to put the heat on. </p>

        <p><p>should we set up another backup off reddit that we can go to if this one gets taken down? any thoughts/suggestions?</p>
<p>If we could come to an agreement we could publish it in the sidebar so as many people can be aware and sticky it...</p></p>

        <p><p>I will post this in every one of your threads. </p>
<p>Here's a statement form Bella, the person YOU claim corroborates your made up story about Monica Petersen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to help get Redditt to take down the thread and stop disrespecting Monica and her family.   Her death had nothing to do with a Clinton conspiracy and she wasn't even researching that.   The details of her death are not anyones business, this is private information that some jerk posted on Reddit after he was asked to keep it private.  Monica was researching sex trafficking which is when a person pimps out a minor for prostitution, and it has nothing to do with Clinton or pedophile rings.  These people have posted this crap all over redditt which is totally disrespecting the family. None of you people seem to have a clue what Monica research was about because you are so quick to jump on the trafficking narrative.  Here is a audio show that interviewed Monica a few months before her death.  Stop tagging Monica name into this shit.  It is all over online and is upsetting to her family, especially since its not true.  Episode 26: Fighting the Trafficking Narrative from </p>

        <p><p>Wow. I have now been contacted by 3 different people privately trying to convince me that there is no link to the foundation. This is really bad. Something is going on.</p>
<p>I repeat, Monica was clearly investigating Clinton.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Back in January 4th Bella shared Monica's findings: https://i.sli.mg/PsLtmj.png</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The day before, on January 3rd, she re-shared a post originally made by Monica with a link to a blog post critical of Hillary Clinton (second item here: http://i.imgur.com/TmiB2gU.png). <strong>"Ms. Clinton has corrupt &amp; dirty business to finish in Haiti ...  This is the theory my masters thesis puts forth"</strong> ----&lt; how do you not see what Monica was up to? Are you blind?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Also FYI, the family has NOT RECEIVED MONICA'S BODY. I repeat, they did not bury her and an autopsy was not done in the US. They are trusting misinformation coming out of Haiti.</strong></p>
<p>If anything, Bella must be very scared at this point. I tend to agree with that gut feeling.</p>
<p>Also, the link you sent is work that Monica and Rex were involved in many months ago, not anything recent.</p></p>
