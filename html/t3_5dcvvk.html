        <p><p>Hey, everyone. Just finished listening to the podcast. I thought there was a lot of good advice, particularly about the dangers of moving prematurely on insufficient information and allowing these investigations to become witch hunts. Thanks to everyone, and keep up the good work. </p></p>
