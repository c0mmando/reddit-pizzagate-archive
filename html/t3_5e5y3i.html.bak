        <strong>The NSA has ALL the data. They fucking know</strong>
        <p><p>Think about the implications of the fact that the US gov has the most sophisticated, most invasive, mass surveillance program in HUMAN HISTORY.  Stronger surveillance than Orwell dreamed of.  People within the intelligence community know ALL ABOUT rampant child abuse.  But they use that info to get political leverage through blackmail, which is why they are not outing these people and getting them prosecuted.  I am praying that we reach a tipping point where the masses become so aware of this dark truth that the media has to report and something can be done to hold TPTB accountable.  Keep up the great work fellas </p></p>

<p>If this is what you are waiting for before you make moves for change, then no change will occur and TPTB will continue the rape and child feast.</p></p>

        <p><p>I dont think so, Trump appeared on Alex Jones broadcast a couple days after he won the presidency, and he also promised to re-open the 9/11 investigation. Hes gonna have a unprecedented level of access to top secret documents and classified material, in fact he'll have direct access to all of it, and being the family man he is I dont think he's gonna stand up for a bunch of baby killing pedophiles. He made a direct stab against hillary and her hunger for haitian children already. The hissing from the crowd on the joke, was louder then the reaction to any of the other ones. </p></p>

        <p><p>no offensive but I think you're being naive.  Trump is friends with Epstein.  Even if he hasn't partaken, he is part of the elite club and knows not to expose this stuff</p></p>

        <p><p>Im aware of this, his contact however was limited and he didnt continue the friendship outside of these trips. Being such a high level business man it very well could've been him just networking, or their attempts to subvert him to their lifestyle, but I am very aware of his involvement with him, and carefully watching what he does. </p></p>

        <p><p>If nothing else, I find some of his statements from [this Howard Stern interview]
(https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2016/10/08/politics/trump-on-howard-stern/index.html)
unsettling. Namely, his descriptions of his daughter, and barging in on naked pageant contestants. </p>
<p>Additionally, he encouraged his daughter to go into modeling, even though he knew the industry was full of managers preying on young women.</p>
<p>At the very least, pretty creepy.</p></p>

        <p><p>Let's be honest about Trump, ya? He'll say he's best friends with anybody. The guy is a showman 100%. Not to say he's bullshitting us, but I wouldn't say he has any real friends. But out of all the people I've seen in politics, I'd say he was least likely to partake. Why? Just a feeling, I guess.</p></p>

        <p><p>Even without the pedophilia, with what hes suggesting publicly its already enough to have their hounds targeting him and his family, and I fully believe doing so would trigger a civil war against them. He wouldnt go down easily.  </p></p>

        <p><p>I believe it was on purpose and the bankers and members of the US intelligence community orchastrated it.  From the towers crumbling to the planes slamming into the the pentagon. Check out webster tarpleys breakdown on 9/11 and synthetic terror . Its a really great break down and will present you with viewpoints you probably never considered before. "Angel is next" in my eyes is one of the most damning pieces of evidence their is. </p></p>

        <p><p>The more logical, likely, and easier explanation is that Bill and Hillary were receiving illegal $$$ from people on watch lists (sound familiar?) and they paid Jamie Gorelick to "put up a wall" between the FBI/CIA/ETC. so that they could not communicate with each other properly.  This allowed certain 19 people to sneak through, not be discovered, and do what they did. Also, Clinton allowed the sale of certain hi-teh communications devices which normally would not have been sold in other countries to regular people, but were now available to the hijackers. Whatever...</p></p>

        <p><p>OK, I'll look at it, one of these days. It's hard for me to believe the bnankers attacked themselves to promote an agenda, but OK. </p>
<p>I'll can say the pentagon WAS hit by a plane, steel beams CAN be melted witth jet fuel (especially since much of one building and ALL of the other were not treated with asbestos because of the environmental wackos)  </p>
<p>And I can say I believe that the towers going down were two symbolic and literal signal flares to the rest of the world that the beginning of the END of the United States has begun and the wind down will commence. And look at what has happened since then! </p></p>

<p>By design, you can only take his voice in small doses.</p>
<p>Trump being on his show just solidifies my fears.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't believe Trump will re-open 9/11.
His son in law Jared Kushner's father helped the Mossad destroy evidence in New Jersey. His father was prosecuted and imprisoned by Chris Christie.
I voted for Trump, but with Jared Kushner by his side, I'm concerned, to say the least. Kushner's are Mossad who played a huge part in orchestrating 9/11. </p></p>

        <p><p>I want to believe this. Really I do. But anyone who expects Trump to <em>volte face</em> into a person that gives a fuck about anyone over than himself, is teetering on the edge of utter, unadulterated disappointment. These politicians are not your saviours. The people's and communities these politicians get you to hate - they're your saviours. But the kool aid  you guzzle down won't let you appreciate how hopelessly you been fooled.</p></p>

        <p><p>They cannot be trusted. They've been stacked for too long without any accountability on the pedophile issues. The Franklin Cover Up was covered up. The satanic pedophile from the 80s and beyond have only grown and become more brazen since then.</p></p>

        <p><p>The media will not cover this because many OWNERS of the media like Murdoch are involved and one of them. Murdoch helped to cover up Madeline McCann. The only option is the public one.
That means DVDS, thumb drives if the internet is not an option.
Passing it around communities with the FACES of these monsters murdering, raping and eating children. I don't care if we've got Hillary Clinton raping a baby... people need to see it.. because that's the only way to begin to destroy these people.</p></p>

        <p><p>The NSA and CIA are currently at war with each other right now. The CIA owns the media, but the NSA knows about the crimes against humanity and such. Snowden was meant to get rid of the NSA. That's why the CIA and their Russian affiliates are keeping him talking. </p>
<p>Oil and banking owns Russian and US politics. In the US it's via satanic pedophilia blackmail rings.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's not just the US, it's all the 5-eyes countries. All countries whom just happen to have large numbers of freemason lodges, who also practice occultist rituals. It's the skull and bones crowd, these people are basically elitist blood lines. They are immensely powerful. The only reason pizza gate even exists is because it all still sounds so ridiculous nobody will believe it. If anyone actually had any meaningful information on the full extent of this circle that person would be snuffed out like a moth to a flame. </p></p>

        <p><p>The NSA and CIA are currently at war with each other right now. The CIA owns the media, but the NSA knows about the crimes against humanity and such. Snowden was meant to get rid of the NSA. That's why the CIA and their Russian affiliates are keeping him talking. </p></p>

        <p><p>We have a battle irregardless. 
Trump may have postponed a war.. 
But the war is brewing and the globalists next option is economic.
The globalists don't just give up. 
They're insane. They don't walk away.
They can blow us up by absolutely decimating the economy.
Trump is not a savior. His son in law Jared Kushner is Mossad.
You know Mossad, the ones who helped direct and plan 9/11?
I voted for Trump.. and want to have hope... but our battle is just beginning... and it will be difficult.</p></p>

        <p><p>No matter how they like to boast, their method is idiotic and so does the NSA guys who left it in disgust (Bill Binney, Tom Drake, Russ Tice, Diane Roarke, Kirk Wiebe, Ed Loomis) think, Bill Binney had a 2 million dollar cheap program that would find criminals easily without breaking any amendment, he was told that the program he developed (he was like, a civilian General over there) by one of his very few superiors that it wasn't going to be done and they were doing Trailblazer instead which was a contractor money milking billions of dollar boondoggle that never worked, was scrapped in '06, it's very hard for them to find specifics in that unimaginable amount of data they suck out of the fibre optics points of entry in the US ISP's.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was just spooked the fuck out when registering to a website the captcha thing did not have a captcha, it just told me to type "pizza party", WHAT IN THE FUCK. I don't even know if I want to join now, it's an innocent electronics forum I know of since a long time.</p></p>

        <p><p>Because most of the photos I saw on several pages were clearly stolen photos from social media. Facebook outsources it's photo stuff to a company called oDesk in Morocco. Any employee at FB can make big money by taking orders for certain kinds of kids or just selling them in general on eBay. It's a huge market.</p>
<p>Remove ALL your kids photos from ALL social media. People think pedos only like nudes...wrong. They love wholesome photos they can fall in love with, and any photos where the child is in costume or bathing suits or any stage of undress. If you knew how bad it was you'd shut your FB down entirely.</p>
<p>I cannot unsee what I saw last night. Even if your FB is private FB employees can see what they want. I cannot state strongly enough...and heaven help posting videos...one page had hijacked video of young kid singing karaoke...the comments were nauseating. </p>
<p>I got off FB years ago...and after last night no more Twitter.</p></p>

        <p><p>Nah, just think about it. With all what OP laid out, wouldn't it make just a bit more sense than thousands of people covering a huge conspiracy with no one leaking anything? After all even the stuff NSA does got leaked. </p>
<p>I'm not saying disturbing shit didn't happen, I just think it could be on a much smaller scale than some people in this sub suggest.</p></p>

        <p><p>You're comment legitimately made me laugh. Not because you're wrong, but because a reasonable suggestion like that makes you the crazy person around here. </p></p>

        <p><p>Honestly, some people take it too far with teories with absolutely no evidence that it's discrediting the whole investigation. They want results too fast and it's conspiracy bullshit like this that's actually derailing the progress and making everyone involved look like a fool. Not the best strategy to go around it, especially with a topic so important like this.</p></p>

        <p><p>The thing that gets me is the knee jerk response that any dissenting opinion has to be a paid shill or some kind of plant sent to throw them off the trail. If a theory were solid then it would stand up to scrutiny. </p></p>
