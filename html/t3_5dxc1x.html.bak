        <strong>Word counts in Podesta e-mails.</strong>
        <p><p>A lot of the evidence here is based around the Podesta e-mails, and code-words used in them. An important question: are they just pasta and pizza entusiasts?  </p>
<p>By going to this webpage and searching for a term you can see how many results you get:
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/  </p>
<p>"Pizza" 149 results <br>
"Pasta" 78 results <br>
"Hot dog" 8 results <br>
"Sushi" 12 results <br>
"Hamburger" 64 results <br>
"Pancakes" 5 results <br>
"Meatballs" 15 results<br>
"Walnut" 47 results <br>
"Sauce" 41 results <br>
"Cheese" 85 results  <br>
"Peanut" 43 results  <br>
"Salad" 103 results   </p>
<p>So what do all these terms mean? Several people have talked about pizza and cheese pizza, and we've heard pasta and hot dog being used as code words as well. However hamburger which doesn't mean anything is almost as common as pasta, and sushi is more common than hot dog.</p>
<p>Edit: added walnut, sauce, cheese, peanut, salad...</p></p>

        <p><p>Interesting observation. I think you may be emphasizing frequency over context. Do that and yeah, big deal they talk about food a lot; they are food enthusiasts. </p>
<p>But you can't overlook the fact that some of the verbiage used is just... odd. Then bring in some of these goofballs Podesta associates with along with the other odd factors and it becomes even more strange.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm digging hard man and all I find is gravel. Going to this page: http://pedocrats.com/podesta-pizza/  </p>
<p>Ctrl-F "Pizza":  </p>

</blockquote>
<p>So I'm trying real hard here to see what it is that you guys are seeing. I'm looking at this collection of e-mails from podesta and I find three e-mails that contain strange wordings. There's no context here where the pizza is used suspiciously. I'm not saying the whole pizzagate is untrue, this code word theory however is really far fetched.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm really trying to follow you here.  </p>
<p>They're talking about ordering hot dogs, which is supposed to mean young boy, why would they want the same waitress? To me that sounds like dudes getting hot dogs and the waitress was hot.  </p>
<p>Also the hot dog fridays sounds kinda nice in this e-mail from the same guy:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chicago Hot Dog Friday is here - Break room.<br>
Bayless, this means there are Chicago Hot Dogs ready to eat. Stand up,
take two hard lefts, walk forward and you'll see the break room. Enjoy.   </p>

<p>https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/emailid/11587</p>
<p>What if Obama spending $65 000 is a joke about him being a Chicagoan who loves Chicagoan hot dogs. <br>
I mean if you're saying it was a true statement (and hot dogs being a codeword), think about what you're implying. Or please spell it out for me because maybe I'm not following you.</p></p>

        <p><p>Seems to me if they were really discussing food as foodies, there would be a lot more types and specifics mentioned.  Also walnut is used far too frequently and in nonsensical contexts. </p></p>

        <p><p>I'm skeptical. That said, someone could perform statistical analysis of the percentage of children if specific race abducted to the rate podesta used each word. This would provide math to back up this claim, it's something you may need help with statistically. Maybe a T-test? Someone help me out, please.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm sorry but that is extremely far fetched. I'm trying to argue that the code-word theory is far fatched and they're literally talking about eating pizzas. If they were only talking about pizzas, pasta and hot dogs I'd agree we're not just shoehorning the code-word part of the theory.</p></p>

        <p><p>I was with you mate, intact far fetched was the exact way I described the whole thing just earlier today. I've since spent the rest of the day reading emails and looking at symbolism very openly displayed at various sites, and unfortunately far fetched it is not. It may not be correct that they are code words, buy it certainly isn't a leap of imagination to believe it's possible.</p></p>

        <p><p>I understand you're feelings. I unfortunately haven't had the time to keep investigating these things deeply. I see these theories and I understand that they are cherry picked from an ocean of information that has been made available through wikipedia.  </p>
<p>I felt like noone else here was presenting the e-mails with fair comparatison of what made them less suspicious. </p>
<p>Like this for instance: <br>
https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html<br>
Out of context I can see what you mean but when you put it in context: <br>
https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/emailid/11587 <br>
I don't see it anymore.  </p>
<p>I feel like digging should be balanced and rational and everyone here is trying hard to only look one way, and eventually that leads to groupthink.</p></p>
