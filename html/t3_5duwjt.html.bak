        <strong>James Alefantis of Comet Pizza could just have a morbid/perverted sense of humor.</strong>
        <p><p>Alright, from what I'm reading about the strange Instagram posts of James Alefantis and/or Comet Pizza, the most I'm willing to admit to at this point is that there could just simply be a morbid and/or sexual sense of humor as an inside joke among James Alefantis and friends. Who follows the Instagram account of a small Pizza place besides people who know the owner?</p>
<p>I believe I've seen all of the strange instagram posts that have been dug up, and I've seen that clip of the stand-up comedian at Comet who may or may not be joking about raping/killing children. Otherwise, I'm unconvinced that there is any justification to connect these pizza joints to other pedophilia rumors regarding people who may or may not know the pizza owner or have gone to that. </p>
<p>I'm here to listen, but I'm asking for better stuff than this. I want to hear about how these rumors of pedophilia in Washington DC directly relates to Comet Pizza or any other establishments in the city. Help me out here, give me more to work on!</p></p>

        <p><p>Surely a part of critical thinking is entertaining the fact that any connection between rumors of pedophilia in Washington DC and the dark humor of the managers of Comet Pizza et. al is simply a coincidence.</p></p>

        <p><p>Has anybody <em>tried</em> searching for other food-related keywords in the wikileaks emails of the people on the Pizzagate suspect list? I saw another person here trying to say that a reference to Wal-Mart chicken wing deli platters were also a code phrase for child sex trafficking. </p></p>

        <p><p>There's also the postscript "...dreaming about your hotdog stand in Hawaii." We would love to know if that means Podesta once owned a hotdog stand in Hawaii, is a foodie who has the inside tip on the best hotdogs in Hawaii (maybe they ate there together once), or there's a hotdog code too! :) </p>

<p>4channer was able to trace it back to an ebay account named something like "babycheese" selling weird shit what sorta looked to be stock images... all the feedback was private</p></p>

        <p><p>I am familiar with that thread and its contents... but that doesn't have a link to Podesta (yet). I think there may be legitimate complaints but we should be very critical of all speculation. Besides 4chan threads (and one book referencing the same 4chan lingo), I haven't found a legitimate source detailing pedophilia code words. I know about the FBI's symbols document, I mean code words. I would love to find something more to support this. Any ideas? </p></p>

        <p><p>Most of the code words come from dark web sites people have taken screenshots of ppl posting their TOR email addresses asking for fresh cheese pizza... then saying 3-8 slices or 8-14 slices please</p>
<p>But if you want a legitimate source are you looking for someone who admits they're a pedo and says themselves thats the lingo they use?</p></p>

        <p><p>Good point. More I was wondering why there isn't a source from law enforcement detailing code words (similar to the one outlining symbolism)... maybe because they don't want to let out their secrets so they can keep working on actually pinpointing pedophiles. </p></p>

        <p><p>Do you have a credible source for this at all?</p>
<p>I have been following this thing for a while, and the only thing that amazes me is that there are people who are gullible enough to think this is a real scandal just because some anon on 4chan tells them it is.</p>
<p>Like all conspiracy theorists, you're all just whining about how everyone is "ignoring the evidence", when in reality, the reason they're ignoring your "evidence" is because you don't have a solid grasp on what actual evidence really <em>is</em>. </p></p>

        <p><p>Well, like I said, it does seem probable that the managers of Comet Pizza have a dark sense of humor, or at least have no problem with it. That's from seeing the video of the ski-masked comedian and the Instagram posts. </p></p>

        <p><p>Consider that they hide behind an innocent (<em>just</em> a morbid/perverse sense of humor) facade, and only those who fit in with the group get to know any more. Then these public displays are actually jokes, they're almost flaunting the power they have, <em>advertising</em> for new members.</p>
<p>I agree that there is potential for him to be innocent, but it's a hard angle to push. Which is why he didn't even try to claim innocence in his latest interview, instead accusing us of all being racist homophobic alt-right conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh he also made his instagram private so that no one could go and see for themselves... not the most innocent move.</p></p>

        <p><p>He doesn't owe anything to you fucking lunatics.. every normal person would make his profile private, when some strangers on the net start calling him pedo. You would as well. Not try to "prove your innocence" to alt right conspiratards, which you definitely are. Who the fuck are you that someone needs to prove his innocence to you? Fucking thought police.</p></p>

        <p><p>Okay, well that guy was just using Craigslist, not an actual front business. We're talking at least three degrees of separation from the well-known Comet Pizza. Again, not a very suspicious set of circumstances with Washington DC where there is a lot of networking with powerful people. How does this relate to Comet Pizza, Besta Pizza, or Red Fox Coffee? Even if Podessa was a hardcore pedophile, pedophiles gotta eat somewhere. Somebody has to do the catering. Still not enough stuff to make a phone call to the FBI without sounding like all you have is speculation. </p></p>

        <p><p>Admittedly there are some differences.  But he was using sophisticated coded language that the Johns would understand. And I'm sure you read in the article that he operated a "brothel in the Brewery District."</p>
<p>How is that any different than a pizza restaurant?  </p>
<p>It's significant  that Podesta was notified by Gendelman of his arrest. Especially since she was with Podesta and Alefantis at a late night "pizza" dinner in early oct 2008, he exact timeframe McFadden was operating.  </p></p>

        <p><p>It is becoming abundantly clear to me that all of the evidence for this theory is compiled by running a word-search through all of the emails, using keywords like "cheese", "pizza", "sacrifice", etc. </p>
<p>What about all of the other restaurants in Washington that do catering for political figures who may or may not have connections to sex trafficking? Did you do a word search for "steak" or "salad bar"? </p></p>

        <p><p>Eric McFadden was a small fry, and he had a small operation. The bigger the conspiracy, the more powerful the players. And the more powerful they are, the better they can bribe and hide. Yes we have no SOLID evidence, but that's what this sub is for, and threads like this aren't helping the cause.</p></p>

        <p><p>People asking for evidence aren't just here to dissuade you. Your evidence should be challenged, and if it stands up to that scrutiny, your argument will be better off for it. </p>
<p>If your intent is to have something actually done about this, then you need to critically examine all evidence put forward. If you're just here to have an internet circlejerk devoid of outside criticism, I guess tell this guy to fuck off and return to your safespace.</p></p>

<p>Imagine having a "child friendly", political friendly place  for fundraising while also having acts like these? so strongly they say its "child friendly" while also most of James' m8s are tied to "stopping" human trafficking.. but are so into this dark edgy shit? I can laugh at a good dead baby joke or something because I have a morbid sense of humour.. but this is something different in being totally fascinated with Infanticide. </p></p>

        <p><p>I wonder if the person in that video is <a href="https://imgur.com/a/QcLEU">"Miss Summer Camp"</a>. Either way, it's a stand-up comedian. Like I said, I think there may be some kind of inside joke among friends of the owner of a hidden "dark side" to Comet Ping Pong. The footage is clearly taken at night time, at an event for adults. I'm not denying that the person on stage is probably making jokes about raping and murdering children. </p></p>

        <p><p>Um its like a place they hold fundraisers for the Clinton Foundation and shit with Podesta so there isn't much seperation at all, hes very closely tied to them. </p>
<p>And they've been using private networks in the government like Clinton which you really shouldn't be fuckin doing whats so unbelievable? You think human trafficking wouldn't exist in the west when sex is such a driving force behind life for some people? If you are a man with everything... amazing apartment, beautiful cars, boats, and have never satisfied yourself sexually, and "morbid" like you're saying... how much would you pay to have your sexual desires secretly for filled? Even if its not pre pubescent, old dirty fucks who want to get their rocks off with beautiful 14 year old virgin slaves. </p>
<p>There is so much access and cover up when theres so much power involved. There is lots of fucked up sexual desire to be satisfied and massive amounts of third world children dead and made into $$. IF you keep denying this doesn't exist you are just letting them have that one more laugh about the dumb fucks like you they've fooled in plain sight </p></p>

        <p><p>Well, don't leave me dry, who's who in Pizzagate? In a business in Politics where everybody knows everybody, it's too easy to dismiss conspiracy theories because they have too many degrees of separation. </p>
<p>From looking at the Comet Pizza website, it would seem like James Alefantis or other associates of Comet Pizza are friends with some artists who sometimes create bizarre artwork.</p>

        <p><p>You have to realise its a way bigger thing than just Comet ping pong with its own symbolism that has an upper class pedo market.</p>
<p>Podesta being close with James is only a piece of the puzzle.. you have to do some reading unfortunately there isn't a straight up picture of them fucking a child for you so you just have to use that little beauty of a thing you call a brain and do some reading.</p></p>

        <p><p>What else? Besta Pizza? The one everybody thinks is Portugese for "Beast" when really it's obviously just "Best Pizza" in an Italian accent? </p>
<p>Okay, their logo is a slice of pizza which has the same design as the symbol for "Boy Lover", according to some circles. That symbol only caught on, of course, because it was inconspicuous and could mistaken for something mundane. That's a mild coincidence. What else is there for Besta Pizza? </p></p>

        <p><p>Anatomy of a coincidence:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>James Alefantis, or whoever runs Comet Pizza, have friends who are artists, and some of them create bizarre/fucked up artwork. Artists can make some pretty freaky shit and have morbid senses of humor, but are otherwise normal, friendly people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Besta Pizza has a stylized logo of a slice of Pizza that, through some set of circumstances, turned out looking like a minimalist symbol for pedophilia. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So what else makes this not the simplest explanation?</p></p>

        <p><p>There are alot more connections than that. You need to do alot more reading because I cant be bothered linking you every fucking thing I've seen. But with this shit you have to connect the dots because  the thing is mate this is super fucking awful underground shady shit and there isn't going to be much in plain site.  We are just lucky we live in an age with hacking and have had access to such leaks.</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree with Best/Besta. (Why would they use the Portuguese for "Beast"? This is a red herring.) </p>
<p>I also though the triangle logo looked like an unfortunate coincidence... what makes it questionable to me is the fact that the owners changed the logo after this was pointed out WITHOUT making a public statement. If that was my business, there would be at the very least a huge statement on the website stating, "It's come to our attention that blah blah blah, and we are mortified! We changed it right away and are working on updating everything." Does it seems strange to you that they did not address it at all?</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah and all those people you linked are either tied to fucked up morbid baby humour like you are saying or are high up running an "anti child trafficking" rig </p>
<p>why would someone connected to so many people trying to help children be into so much shit about people laughing about killing babies? its just so conflicting... like thats a really morbid sense of humour... </p></p>

        <p><p>No, most of the artwork featured on those pages doesn't seem bizarre at all. In fact, it kind of creates a predicament for the Pizzagate theory when the people running Comet Pizza's online media are obviously friends with various artists. I've seen art galleries and how artists mingle, and how some artists make bizarre or fucked up artwork. Most of them are normal, ordinary people. </p></p>

        <p><p>um what are you saying? that the simplest explanation is that its all a coincidence? You havent read shit you fuckin dickhead there must be 1000 coincidences for this then. All the places with the logos are all tied CLOSELY to the Clinton Foundation. People have been saying this shit for fuckin years and years about washington/hollywood with no one to believe them and new evidence that says hey maybe they weren't fucking crazy and shouldn't have been slapped with counts of perjury?  but thats just another coincidence on top of 1000 </p></p>

        <p><p>Theorizing about who's a pedophile in Washington DC is one thing, but it seems like the work of some innocent artists is being misinterpreted as somehow being a reference to victims of child sex trafficking in this hypothetical conspiracy. </p></p>

        <p><p>I kind of disagree about your view on art, particularly with regard to the Podesta collection. </p>
<p>I collect art and have many friends and acquaintances who are artists and/or collectors. When someone has an inordinate amount of a specific subject (whether artist or collector), it is insight into what they're into intellectually, spiritually, and/or sexually. Someone who creates or owns an inordinate amount of art featuring young children in half-dressed state or naked and/or depicted in distressing position would/should set off alarm bells with anyone who knows this. </p>
<p>As for the video, I agree with most of what you say. The inclusion of child images is strange, but nothing nefarious, and some look like they were taken from online costume stores or something. </p></p>

        <p><p>Let's start a little further out: Why does James Alefantis have such close access to Podesta? Why does Podesta talk about Comet Ping Pong so much and include him as a celebrity chef and work him into events, etc. so much? Is the pizza just that good? In what world is Podesta a friend with some average Joe pizza shop owner? THAT is what I find weird.</p></p>

        <p><p>James Alefantis is the former gay boyfriend of David Brock. So, he qualifies as someone who definitely had the chance to network with powerful people, while still being considered the "average Joe" friend. </p></p>

        <p><p>Well, it's kind of cheating if James Alefantis probably only knows John Podesta from networking with his former gay boyfriend David Brock (a political figure). And Podesta is only speculated to be a pedophile himself. </p></p>

        <p><p>Podesta was not the end of any chain I gave as an example. I don't think links through David Brock should be negated... you yourself acknowledged that he may have been able to rub elbows with Washington elites like Podesta because of his relationship with Brock. </p></p>

<p>Look at this picture. This was posted to the Comet Pizza instagram by "Miss Summer Camp", a drag queen performance artist. Are we to believe that this individual is involved in this hypothetical sex trafficking ring for seemingly little reason other than to mock it's victims, or do the owners of Comet Pizza just have friends who make strange, twisted artwork? </p></p>

        <p><p>Oh I saw that one. That's a drag queen and its not very uncommon of a sight in Brooklyn, NY. Some of the parties out there could make this piece look like a rugrats episode.</p>
<p>The real question should be why are they doing drag shows at a kids restaurant? Drag is not for children lol</p></p>

        <p><p>I think I'm with you but still open to ideas. Searching "alefantis" brings up only 16 emails in the entire archive, a few in October 2015 and a few in October 2016. Surely this supplier of child prostitutes would have more emails with Podesta if that's what he wanted? I'd expect to see a lot more simple "give me a call" or "come see me" or "need pizza" messages.</p></p>

        <p><p>Look. There's s ton of circumstantial evidence.   If you were really concerned and look at the videos and read the post don't expect people to spoonfeed you.  If there was enough evidence to put them in jail it would have already happened the objective is to find more information out and not stop looking or give up because some concern troll came to the board and said G guys I really don't think there's anything going on.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't want this to get buried so I will post it alone. Having weird morbid sense of humor and obsession with children is called something, it is called pedophilia. Being obsessed with children that aren't yours and posting 5 and unders on your instagram is something that a pedophile does. Imagine what this guy does on something other than a public forum. Brazen hubris led him to do it out in the open until he obviously and rightfully so was exposed.</p></p>

<p>If you're thinking of this picture (on the right), this was actually posted to Comet's Instagram page 4 days ago, when the pizzagate theory was already propagating the internet. The account that posted this, rampage_1804 (Rampage Jean-Jacques Dessaline) has various accounts on the internet which promote anti-Hillary material. The person who painted this, Ria</p></p>

        <p><p>No, I am talking about the dozens of photos of actual children under 5. It is fucking weird, and displays a sort of obsession. If my instagram had tons of pictures of guns on it you could infer that I had some sort of liking/obsession with guns.</p></p>

        <p><p>I only know of the picture of a kid's hands taped to the table. The vast majority of pictures are adults having fun.</p>
<p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BKBLkTwAeAD/?taken-at=85083</p>
<p>There's this picture, which is obviously a poster for the band <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Sex-Stains-442409042556043/">Sex Stains</a>. The poster says "all ages". We have two possibilities for what this could mean:</p>
<p>"All ages" is meant to be ironic; or, most likely, the band wants to specify that their music is not overtly vulgar despite their band name and the nature of their poster. </p>
<p>I don't see any pictures of guns on their page, at least not any time recently. </p></p>

        <p><p>There are over a dozen that I have seen. The most concerning is the one with a 20 something man cuddling a young child with a large yellow necklace around both and the #chickenlover....</p></p>

<p>That's the manager. I guarantee you that's his offspring. </p></p>

        <p><p>How do you know it's the manager? There is no information on the site that I can see about that. What's up with the chicken lover hashtag then?</p></p>

        <p><p>I swear I've seen footage of this guy in another video about Comet. </p>
<p>They serve chicken at Comet Ping Pong. </p>
<p>EDIT: here's another picture of him: https://i.imgur.com/3FxsShq.jpg</p></p>

        <p><p>It's confirmed to be the building's designer. His wife was a manager, and that is their daughter (not son). They now live on the west coast. </p>
<p>Chicken lover is not a widespread term, by the way. It's made out to be in this subreddit, but it's totally not. They were probably literally eating chicken or it's another inside joke.</p></p>
