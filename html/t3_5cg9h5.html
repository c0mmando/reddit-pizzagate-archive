        <strong>Someone please archive the "Art Gallery" website of James Alefaggot. Lots of weird images for an "Art Gallery"</strong>
        <p><p>http://www.transformerdc.org/</p>
<p>The images as well as the titles of the albums are fucking weird.</p>
<p>This one contains a straight up SCARY image of legos and a masked, creepy figure
http://www.transformerdc.org/exhibitions/images/appropriately-yours</p>
<p>This one is called "Itsy Bisty Bollocks"
http://www.transformerdc.org/exhibitions/images/itsy-bitsy-bollocks
Could be referencing how Zika Virus causes male testicles to shrink and become infertile?</p>
<p>This one contains an image of what looks like to be a diaper or a pair of kids underwear laying on the floor.

<p>Archive everything on this site! Also follow the money - art galleries are perfect coverups for money laundering and Comet Ping Pong James Alefantis owns this so-called "gallery".</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't even want to view the images, but it sounds like you've found something.</p></p>
