        <strong>Pizza gate is legit but post quality here is lagging</strong>
        <p><p>Too much doxing before enough research is done. Too many leaps in conclusions. Too many people posting in caps lock.</p>
<p>Slow it down. Im not saying take years, but take a few minutes to think about what youre posting. Maybe even do a few drafts... peter sweitzer (sp.?) destroyed clintons with a well researched book and thought out book... we may not be able to do that but we wont get their with half ass jumping to conclusions shit posts.</p>
<p>I believe this is legit. We just need to raise the bar for what is useful content and what is rando grasping at straws conspiracy...</p>

        <p><p>If you look at a lot of these accounts, you'll start noticing how new they all are. How they have posts almost solely on here or say r/conspiracy. All with just a couple dozen points of comment karma. It's pretty obvious that SOMEBODY is catching on and we're being flooded by false flags, distractions, and sock puppet accounts. Someone is trying to either make us look bad or trip us up, keep us running in circle or at each other's throats with accusations so that nothing gets done. </p>
<p>We need to stick together, the people we know are legit. This is already growing out of control faster than we can follow.</p></p>

        <p><p>OH, so this explains the fucking retarded posts. Thanks Shattered. This sub may be too compromised, should we, rather than using this separate sub, take this investigation back to The_Donald? The visibility is huge, they are already familiar with the conspiracy, they aren't compromised like we are, and they have weaponized autists while we have lunatic tinfoilers</p></p>

        <p><p>Some of the stuff I have posted can't be directly linked to podesta, but I still feel like I found something that is important. The last posts I made were garbage when i thought someone correctly decrypted then photos, but not trying to derail this sub. </p></p>

        <p><p>Some people have friends that know their accounts and don't wanna post this shit, some people are paranoid of being suicided for finding something out, and some people just plain make new accounts on Reddit a lot because of forgetfulness. This is to be expected. A lot people are taking this seriously (look at rhe presence in Finland that is most likely VPN usage, for instance). People are covering their tracks so new accounts are expected. </p>
<p>That said the post quality needs to go up</p></p>
