        <strong>About the 2 GB CP hacker . I dont know who to believe anymore . Here is what I saw</strong>
        <p><p>Some people are claiming It was a fake . I don't know if it's true but here is what I saw AMA .</p>
<p>Zip file with 10 jpg file no virus detected or anything </p>
<p>Im still in shock of what I saw .The file he posted had 10 pic of 8 different kids  </p>
<p>2 pic of an indian girl crying 5yo .  </p>
<p>1 pic of a 4yo dark skin asian tied getting raped .  </p>
<p>2 pic of a toddler being forced to oral sex  ( white ) .<br>
1 pic of 2 yo girl getting tortured with needles (white) .  </p>
<p>1 pic of a 4yo girl getting raped(white)  , <br>
1 pic of 2yo boy getting raped (white) . <br>
1 pic of 4yo tied and full of bruises.
1 pic of a 1yo girl tied With ( please lick me ) written on her </p>
<p>there is no pic of the rapist's Face only their genitalia , the surrounding furnitures look cheap and poor   </p>
<p>Metadata didnt show anything ( I verified for 2 pics ) , and it seems like it's different places , the kids were not abused in the same room.        </p>
<p>I don't advise anyone to view download or save them , I described the content so people don't have to .   </p>
<p>the pizza front he claimed has them is WeThePizza </p>
<p>Update : The hacked website WeThePizza is down !!!!!!!!    This means He was telling the truth !!! WeThepizza is also connected to Comet pizza !!</p>
<p>( english is my third language sorry )</p>
<p>Edit : </p>
<p>We still didnt establish if OP is not a troll here is his 
original post  :</p>
<p>"Hi, I am quickly posting this from a random open wifi so I will only will be available for questions about how to PROPERLY LEAK THIS only for 30 minutes for OPSEC reasons.</p>
<p>Let's make it quick with the questions, long story short: I cracked into a suspicious "pizza/family center" and their netsec was shit. I made off with an encrypted list of their clients, and 2GB of unencrypted videos, which after glancing at the site's source code, there was a hidden login that allowed you to view "actives, services, and pricing" after logging in, the videos/photos were under the "activities" and "services" page. Not sure if they are aware of my intrusion, so not listing the site yet.</p>
<p>So here is what I have, and how should I leak it?:</p>
<p>2GB of brutal videos and photos of little boys and girls being raped. ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING TO WATCH!!!!!</p>
<p>An unencrypted spreadsheet of the pricing for each act (rape $10,000, minor torture $35,000, severe torture $100,000 and murder $250,000). Prices were different based on if the victim was a boy, girl, white, black, and age etc.</p>
<p>And I have an encrypted list of all their clients.</p>
<p>Okay guys, how should I leak this? Should I just post the child porn? Is that even fucking legal? I feel I should submit this to the FBI but I DO NOT TRUST THEM and I have a strong feeling wikileaks is compromised as well. And if I don't login within 24hours tell my family I loved them.</p>
<p>FBI/CIA/NSA/LE/YOU EVIL MOTHERFUCKERS: I HAVE A DEADMAN SWITCH SETUP, IF I DON'T RESET MY SWITCH ONCE EVERY 12 HOURS IT ALL GETS RELEASED ON AN .ONION AND .I2P AND ALL THE LINKS GETS POSTED TO OVER 100 SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. AND I THINK SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS FACES ARE IN THE VIDEOS, SO DON'T TRY ANYTHING STUPID. "</p></p>

        <p><p>You really need to be careful with what you click on and download considering that the <a href="http://thenextweb.com/security/2016/11/11/the-fbi-likely-ran-nearly-half-the-child-porn-sites-on-the-dark-web-in-2016/">FBI has run a honeypot for half of all CP websites in 2016</a>. That submission very much looked like an attempt to derail the crowd-sourced investigation here into high-ranking officials involvement in CP-related activities in a couple ways. One, linking this subreddit to the distribution of CP, and two, getting unsuspecting users/would-be investigators to possess CP. Be smart, protect yourself.</p></p>

        <p><p>Do you guys realize what this means? Any person in government who is a pedo could be traced, have their webcam accessed and be blackmailed by the shadow government via the honeypots. They could even slowly accumulate pedophiles into positions of power and force out non-pedos so they have total control via blackmail.</p>
<p>Once they control enough of the government they can be made to do things like what Germany did when they opened their borders. Or when Iraq was invaded under a false pretext.</p></p>

        <p><p>Give this poster a prize. EXACTLY.</p>
<p>There is currently a VERY SCARED very pissed of leader of a very tiny country full of asshattery with a very very dedicated and nasty intelligence agency completely devoted to this...blackmailing gov. officials.</p>
<p>There is ZERO to blackmail Trump over...this did not go according to plan...this is first hand knowledge..told to me immediately after the election. (I'm relaying it differently than told to me)</p>
<p>Suddenly this powerful asshat is under investigation himself....for corruption.</p>
<p>EPSTEIN....do you think...there were NO hidden cameras? Srsly...there were hidden cameras streaming direct uploads to this organizations special files...epSTEIN.</p></p>

        <p><p>Christ man....I've been thinking about this myself. Check out this article from 2015:</p>
<p>http://nationalvanguard.org/2015/01/jeffrey-epstein-the-uncovering/</p>
<p>And then check this out:</p>
<p>https://www.stormfront.org/forum/t990494/</p>
<p>(I've never been to that site before, just found it through google) </p>
<p>So what the fuck? Seriously do the lies go this deep? This is Truman Show level illusion if that's the case. But it makes everything make so much more sense...</p></p>

        <p><p>I have been talking about the blackmail aspect for years...no one believes...but anyone who knows anything about $cientology absolutely believes. They perpetrated the single largest infiltration of the US gov. to date (make that known infiltration)...and got their nonprofit status by trapping the son of the IRS head in Mexico on film with a clearly underaged girl. BOOM instant non profit status.</p>
<p>They are and have been blackmailing government officials for YEARS&gt;..the US gov. uses that cult to place assets...in other countries under the religious workers guise. If a cult does it...why the hell would we pretend the ONLY country in the ENTIRE WORLD that has over 300 UNINSPECTED nuclear weapons is getting everything they want from everyone they want...is not doing the same damn thing. A video of Hill licking a teen? OMG they have to be DYING that she lost...
Obama hope and change...LOL we got short changed...he did passive aggressive shit to that teeny asshat...but nothing overt...he is gay or bi...and they blackmailed him...</p>
<p>they get their fingers in the pie by compromising people across the entire spectrum.</p></p>

        <p><p>He has zero to blackmail Trump with and never will. Trump smiled and shook hands but he also said he is cutting aid to the Middle East....hello. Israel has been assraping the US because JESUS or GOD for years..they have one of the largest oil reserves in the Middle East..found not so long ago...they do not need US money..they need our armies....</p>
<p>But since Trump..?</p>

<p>I read somewhere that Trump doesn't smoke, drink or do drugs nor does he have an internet connection, he's old school like that. So it doesn't surprise me that there is nothing to blackmail him with.</p></p>

        <p><p>Hard to know what to believe anymore, it really is an info war.</p>
<p>I'm thinking believe it's real, these sites are easy to hack, we're dealing with pedophiles who probably don't know much about cyber security. People keep asking for SOLID proof, well this guy seemed to have it, unfortunately the SOLID proof in this scenario is illegal to possess. It just doesn't make any sense to try and honeypot a bunch of redditors, these people are dealing with much bigger issues at the moment, they've gotta know the dam's about to break.</p>
<p>Anyways all just speculating, it struck me as real also, so hard to know what to believe anymore. I've always figured this evil Hostel/Saw type shit was going on throughout the world. Scary that we can't even trust contacting the FBI with this stuff.</p></p>

        <p><p>Not sure how long the link was up, but if it was a honeypot, quite sure they would keep it up for longer. Starting to think that the OP was for real. One possibility was that someone was trolling or trying to destroy the pizzerias/owners reputation which seems kinda risky considering he had to upload CP to do so.</p>
<p>WeThePizza taking the site down tells alot though. If there is nothing shady going on, they could've just come public to share their side of the story.</p></p>

        <p><p>Agree - honeypot should stay up as long as possible to catch as many people as possible.  I think the sabotage angle is a stretch.  But it bugs me that the OP posted illegal images instead of posting his methodology so others could confirm what he did</p></p>

        <p><p>Yea, its quite a stretch, don't think anyone would risk going to prison for that sort of stuff.</p>
<p>I agree that OP should've used some other way to show his telling the truth. Now we have no way of checking if those are hosted on the server.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's simple, believe the worst. It's the only correct thing to do. The gravity of the crimes is too serious to treat it any other way. Governments are implicated in all this, we can't really afford to treat these people like they're innocent until proven guilty - if we ignore the suspicious activity it will NEVER go to a court room, it will NEVER be investigated, it will CONTINUE TO THRIVE. If the implicated are all innocent and pizzagate is BS, the implicated should (or will at some point) come forward and give reasonable explanations to all the suspicious activity we've been looking into.</p>
<p>As things stand, I've not seen a single implicated person step forward, claim to be innocent, and try to explain themselves. Instead i've seem the implicated curse at the accusers, edit websites and logos to cover up potential links, and/or stay silent. It's like instead of clearing their name, they are betting on and wishing for this all to be swept under the rug. Maybe they're innocent and just scared of the bad PR (and rightly so, it's a damning accusation), but they should understand the longer they play defensively, the worse it will look on them, specially after steps have been taken that prove some of the implicated are 100% aware of the suspicions. It only makes me more suspicious, and it should only make you more suspicious too. The train need to keep going until the implicated step forward and prove their innocence. Because if there's a shred of truth to pizzagate, it means children are being abused by big-wigs and the government is either directly involved, or allows it to happen. If that's the situation, we simply can't allow the offenders to keep their position of innocence UNTIL they actually claim they are innocent and offer explanations. IMO the reason nobody is doing that is because they're all fucking guilty. A scary amount of pizzagate theories are based upon actual observations, actual ties, actual links. It's getting more and more popular yet the stance of the implicate remains extremely suspicious and defensive.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well a number of people on our side have the "original" files now. If it was all a honeypot, then hopefully people permanently remove the files and move on. I wouldn't necessarily worry at this point. There are enough skilled eyes looking into this that sooner or later, something has got to give.</p>
<p>My main worry is that if these sick pedo fucks do get caught, how much of the information relating to their crimes could be lost to time. So many innocents affected who will never have their story revealed.</p></p>

        <p><p>That reminds me, did we ever hear back from the fellow in Hawaii who had found all the weird wifi signals under a concrete slab in the backyard of the house he was renting?                        </p>
<p>I believe he was working for a guy who was selling "trashed/ruined/old" hard drives on ebay, &amp; the feedback was ridiculously excited ppl exclaiming how "it's so worth it"/"the real deal"/other strange, disconcerting shit to say abt old crappy hard drives.                              </p>
<p>I hope he got out &amp; away safely. (｡- _ -｡❀)                      </p></p>

        <p><p>Somebody (CIA or other people) is totally monitoring the situation on reddit and 4chan, twitter etc. Important links on twitter are getting deleted in minutes if not seconds. Reddit is too public for this stuff. They have plenty of time to destroy and fake new found evidence.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah I realized all this stuff is being heavily monitored at the server level, so not even with mods or anything, this stuff is being tracked by people with the highest levels of access within Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Google, probably 4chan maybe even 8chan. I had an old account that got banned but I had been doing tons of Pizzagate research and probably had over 50 posts/comments randomly deleted. Google is a big part of the information suppression they're making it really hard to find the smoking gun within this whole mess. Anyways they've gotta be shitting bricks, the deleting of evidence just furthers the suspicion this is all real.</p></p>

        <p><p>Shitting bricks is not even the half of it. People who aren't related to abuse, but instead are related to suppression will be facing life in prison for their role. </p>
<p>Anyone related likely will also have to watch out for public backlash including vigilantism. <strong>The day of the rope is nigh</strong>. </p></p>

        <p><p>Reddit is too public. You should try and create similar groups via steam/gog and similar platforms and continue the investigation more privately, NOT abandoning reddit. </p>
<p>We can try to go to a subs like r/Parenting/ and alike with active userbase and just try to hijack the threads. I think it's quite a valid option at this point.</p></p>

        <p><p>Not what I meant. I absolutely want this to be maximally public. Am aware of christian abuse by LEADERS of church (often) - but if you let socially conservative people know what's going on they generally will want to take a stand against it very strongly. Am not denying church abuse at all. </p></p>

        <p><p>ANYONE who is on tape...is going to fight this to the bitter end to save their own asses. They compromise people at all levels...from cops to lawyers to judges...hell some of the compromise is even fake...meaning a set up...but that hardly matters once the set up person starts "helping".</p>
<p>There is literally no place to hide from them and they are not only watching..white and black hats, they are fucking collectively shitting their pants.</p>
<p>There is an internal war going on.</p></p>

        <p><p>There is no proof these images came are relating to 'PizzaGate', it's likely they were ripped from the darkweb and posted here. My suspicion is a crafted troll, either for self-gratification, or to distract people from the real leads - accompanied by "CTR shills" calling people out who don't believe. If the compromise were real, non-CP material would've been released FIRST (my belief).</p>
<p>Regardless, proceed with caution.</p></p>

        <p><p>You've heard that, but very few people on earth can know that for sure. You're probably thinking of a timing attack, which involves a malicious actor controlling entry and exit nodes. That's certainly possible, but this type of attack is typically irrelevant for Tor "hidden services" (.onion links) because the user's traffic is never routed through an exit node when visiting a hidden service. Though, if a malicious actor controls the hidden service itself and the right entry nodes, then a timing attack would be possible again.</p>
<p>Point is, it's complicated and we don't know for sure. In general I trust the Tor developers and they've put a lot of effort into mitigating various attacks. But, Tor alone is only part of a secure solution and it's definitely not enough in itself for dealing with highly sensitive material. I'm not an expert, but more complete security solutions often involve using virtual machines, Live USB Linux OSes that run entirely in RAM, connecting from a network away from your home, etc.</p>

        <p><p>If they were taken from the servers in question, then it's irrelevant where they came from. Whether We produced the images, or whether they got the images somewhere else and were just hosting them, a crime has been uncovered, and it took place at an establishment connected with Comet, et al. That's enough to prosecute and start busting this thing open.</p>
<p>The question is really, did the OP get them off the WiFi network at We, or did he just rip them off the Dark Web?</p>
<p>In the first case, he's a hero. In the second, he's criminal pondscum.</p></p>

        <p><p>His claim was that he got the images / data from wethepizza right? I just wanna clarify that because I was unsure. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, that is what he claimed.</p>
<p>I really wanted to believe the OP was real, but this is all starting to crumble. OP originally said the Pizza place was 'Unidentified'. I also understand that he claimed these images lacked metadata.</p>
<p>Then he came out and named the pizza place, and then the images turned out to have metadata.</p>
<ol>
<li>That's fishy.</li>
<li>The people analyzing the images are actively committing a serious criminal offense.</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel really bleh about this whole situation now.</p></p>

        <p><p>I saw somewhere on the 4chan thread, people posting the Owner's (of wethepizza ) Instagram pictures. Dude was posting pictures of him and people he knows with several high level officials, and also of him in Saudi Arabia...Is there any merit to that you think? </p></p>

<p>That can mean either:</p>
<ol>
<li>We really is involved in Pizzagate</li>
<li>OP knew about this connection, and specifically targeted We for plausibility.</li>

        <p><p>Idk how sketchy it is. Some angry Redditor claimed s/he was reaching out to We to let them know that a bunch of crazy idiots were spreading shit about them here. That was twenty minutes ago. </p>
<p>May have been a reaction to that. </p>
<p>They may have something to hide.</p>
<p>~~Maybe they were hacked by anons.~~</p>
<p>Just no way to know.</p>
<p>Edit: Admin page is still online. That rules out hacking. We pulled their website down.</p></p>

<p>I said that it was a lose-lose situation to inform them. If We is innocent, reacting will throw fuel on the fire (I was right: they took down their website, and now look at the commotion). If We is guilty, Redditor is helping to enable child abuse by informing We.</p>
<p>Redditor didn't care. We're a hated bunch, it seems.</p></p>

        <p><p>How did he present the link?  I didnt see any links.  Was he misleading, or did he say "this is a link to what I found".   Everybody was telling him not to post it; they were saying just share the method.  Thats what makes this all sound sketchy, that he would ignore everybody</p></p>

        <p><p>That seems like classic honeypot tactics. No one will ever be able to verify where they came from unless you download the pictures. If you download the pictures, they have every reason to throw you in prison and now all of a sudden there's 50+ less people investigating pizzagate. As soon as those 50+ people disappear, everyone on this sub will notice, get scared, and will stop looking into it. I have every reason to believe WeThePizza OP is trying to bait everyone into a trap and no reason to believe he's legit. Providing a link to actual CP was not the way to go about this.</p></p>

        <p><p>50? More like five. Most people do not look at that sort of stuff and ask others what they think of it instead. But yes, it would entrap the most bold and the most foolish. That is how they will pick us off, one at a time. </p></p>

        <p><p>Oh...Hm? but OP here claims metadata did not show anything? </p>
<p>If the pics are actually from 2013, does that imply that they could be fake (as in the OP from the other thread just ripped them from dark web and posted it to cause a ruckus?) or that they've been storing old images for whatever reasons (assuming the place he hacked is legit, and his story is legit) ? Do you follow what I mean? </p></p>

<p>As of right now it looks like someone was just trolling this sub with pics they probably obtained from the darkweb. The OP of the deleted thread said he had contacted major news agencies and that the story would break tomorrow, but he wouldn't name what agencies he contacted. </p></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Oh I didn't know that, I hope that is true...I also hope the OP was not lying to us or trying to derail us. If what he said is true, it is a bombshell and a half. </p>
<p>If it IS true, why would they have images stored on a website from 2013? Seems....stupid no? Risky?</p>
<p>I'm unsure what to believe. I know what my gut is telling me. </p>
<p>Also it's discomforting that the OP said he had about 30 mins to talk, and then deleted his thread. Somewhat lends to the legitimacy of the post. </p>
<p>You think whoever that OP was, he was lying? </p></p>

        <p><p>The images were "advertisements" for services they charged fees for according to OP. I.e. Raping and murdering children so it's plausible they were that old. Also mods deleted the post I think</p></p>

        <p><p>The thread was deleted by the mods of this sub.
In my opinion the OP of the deleted thread was lying. He said he had in his possession an encrypted client list and a decrypted price list. However, the only proof he provided was apparently linking to 10 CP images in a zip folder (I did not view the images or download them). </p>
<p>He did not disclose the non-cp files to us or provide us with any proof that the images were from the pizza site he purportedly hacked. So logic leads us to believe it is just some sick fuck trolling this sub. I guess we will know tomorrow for sure. </p></p>

        <p><p>Well, I suppose anything is possible. But I personally do find it hard to believe that the OP of that thread would go that far out of his way...but then again, we're on the internet. </p>
<p>Someone else said this, and I have to agree, I doubt news agencies will ever publish a story like this. Whether it be influence from the top preventing it, or the story being discredited by other groups, I feel like we will never see any of the proof if it does indeed exist. </p></p>

        <p><p>What a catch 22 - you can't legally share or view this garbage, but thats the only way that you can catch them and stop these people.</p>
<p>Personally, i dont want to see it and i wont be digging into that.  Im not brave enough, smart enough, and i dont feel capable of protecting myself legally.   But i think the sources of this stuff has to spread on 4chan and you need to keep this community in the loop so they can follow along</p></p>

        <p><p>Can I just say how disgusted I am</p>
<p>Like in the grand scheme of things, I am still going to research other things on pizzagate. But I just need to express how disgusted I am. Raping someone that young leads to internal damage that just... it's murder. It's so disgusting already but just... sorry, had to vent.</p></p>

        <p><p>The original hacker OP said that he had attained the 2GB, and posted the photos as proof of the claim. Obviously, this claim is disputed because he did not post the actual price lists, or other things he said he had. So it's hard to know anything for sure. </p></p>

        <p><p>I apologize in advance if this doesn't answer your question~                                 </p>
<p>In orig post, OP mentioned videos as well as pictures. I'm quite a derp abt comp stuff, &amp; I know video takes up much more space, but in comparison to pics or other shit/text, I honestly don't know.           </p>
<p>despite all of this disgusting horror, I hope I helped, even a little bit with this~ have a good night(｡- _ -｡❀)~                     </p>
<p>Below is a copy-pasta of orig;</p>
<p>"Hi, I am quickly posting this from a random open wifi so I will only will be available for questions about how to PROPERLY LEAK THIS only for 30 minutes for OPSEC reasons.
Let's make it quick with the questions, long story short: I cracked into a suspicious "pizza/family center" and their netsec was shit. I made off with an encrypted list of their clients, and 2GB of unencrypted videos, which after glancing at the site's source code, there was a hidden login that allowed you to view "actives, services, and pricing" after logging in, the videos/photos were under the "activities" and "services" page. Not sure if they are aware of my intrusion, so not listing the site yet.
So here is what I have, and how should I leak it?:
2GB of brutal videos and photos of little boys and girls being raped. ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING TO WATCH!!!!!
An unencrypted spreadsheet of the pricing for each act (rape $10,000, minor torture $35,000, severe torture $100,000 and murder $250,000). Prices were different based on if the victim was a boy, girl, white, black, and age etc.
And I have an encrypted list of all their clients.
Okay guys, how should I leak this? Should I just post the child porn? Is that even fucking legal? I feel I should submit this to the FBI but I DO NOT TRUST THEM and I have a strong feeling wikileaks is compromised as well. And if I don't login within 24hours tell my family I loved them.
FBI/CIA/NSA/LE/YOU EVIL MOTHERFUCKERS: I HAVE A DEADMAN SWITCH SETUP, IF I DON'T RESET MY SWITCH ONCE EVERY 12 HOURS IT ALL GETS RELEASED ON AN .ONION AND .I2P AND ALL THE LINKS GETS POSTED TO OVER 100 SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. AND I THINK SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS FACES ARE IN THE VIDEOS, SO DON'T TRY ANYTHING STUPID."</p></p>

<p>Is the FBI document you will find by clicking the above link real or not? Yes or no?</p>
<hr>
<p>I think this is what some of you were looking for:</p>
<p>100 page 2013 FBI Maryland Court Document. 23 CP sites. Some folks on twitter think it may show links to certain people, and / or show FBI wrongdoing. Or it shows the FBI on the case. Either it is a red herring, or breadcrumbs.</p>

<p>Released November 12 https://twitter.com/wikileaks</p>
<p>CONCLUSION.</p>
<ol>
<li>Based on the information identified above, information provided to me, and my experience and training, I have probable cause to believe there exists evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities of criminal activity related to the sexual exploitation of children on computers that access Websites 1-23, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 992251 and 2252A. 223. Based on the information described above, there is probable cause to believe that the information described in Attachment B constitutes evidence and instrumentalities of these crimes. 224. Based on the information described above, there is probable cause to believe that employing a NIT on Websites 1-23, to collect information described in Attachment B, will result in the FBI obtaining the evidence and instrumentalities of the child exploitation crimes described above.</li>

        <p><p>UPDATE</p>
<p>The level of incompetence in this "hack" is extremely concerning. I am not sure what OP was trying to accomplish, but without the private key this is useless</p>
<p>Please provide all of the data/files/html as evidence to MULTIPLE PDs (local or otherwise including the NYPD) before posting on the internet. You need to protect yourself, and establish a chain of evidence. Contacting an attorney is also very critical. If you do not have an attorney, get one asap.</p>
<p>If you do provide "evidence" on the web do it in an encrypted dump in bittorrent, all users should be careful and protect themselves, this could be a honeypot</p>
<p>No one cry wolf without validating OP's "evidence". Bringing false leads to the authorities is a surefire way to lose all credibility for this sub.</p>
<p>edit: Other users have pointed out, with good reason that local PD alone may be complicit and may not be the course of action. Simply linking on the internet is not how you bust these people though. You need to get as many eyes on the evidence as possible and make sure they understand you want to establish a chain of evidence and that your life is in danger.</p></p>

        <p><p>So Andrew Kline is the Lawyer of Alefantis, and this Mendelshon fucker for no reason while being DOJ &amp; owning besta pizza? Yeah I buy that. It's all just coincidence, nothing to see here. Let's go back to a years-old bullshit psyop website and dig for nothing. </p>
<p>These bastards stink so bad you can smell them 5 states away. Look at the legal info around them. This is legit. </p></p>

        <p><p>Viewing or saving CP is not a good idea at all. No matter how secure you OpSec, having CP on a harddrive is hard evidence and you could be prosecuted for it. For all we know, the guy who posted it could be trying to inhibit our investigation by getting us to possess CP and tipping off authorities discrediting a lot of what we're doing and making us look bad.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yep I deleted whatever I had.  That shit's way too nuclear to keep even as evidence.  I don't have the proper precautions in place to do that.  I'm sure there's someone with the proof file out here, but I can tell you it exists because I verified the proof. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah but I just need to know the truth. I'd be writing this off as a low level troll if I hadn't verified for myself. </p>
<p>There's still no proof that he isn't a dumb high-level troll, though.</p></p>
