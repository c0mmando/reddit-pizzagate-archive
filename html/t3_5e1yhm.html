        <p><p>I asked the same thing.. While I still dont have a answer. This is the most damning thing I've found personally.</p>
<p>In one of Hillary's intercepted emails, an aide says at the very bottom of the mail, "I will be sacrificing a chicken to moloch..."</p>
<p>That was way before people even dug into comet ping pong, that was just some weird shit in a email.</p>
<p>Weeks later the digging into comet begins, 
Then someone discovered by coincidence that comet ping pong's instagram had a picture of a covered book with the heading "Moloch Maschine".</p>
<p>Moloch is a god of child sacrifice apparently...:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch</p>
<p>Now call me crazy, but this is the first big "what the fuck" to me. </p>

        <p><p>Two possibilities:
1. Its just what you are required to do to be a member of these inner circles
2. Maybe there is some magical truth to Satanism that it grants you powers (haha, sounds crazy; but hey, all of the elites, most famous people seem to be doing it and they are either intelligent or talented; idk)</p></p>

        <p><p>well...the whole granting you powers shit seems a little stupid. I mean... were not living in a movie. </p>
<p>I think the most plausible thing is that it makes it more valuable as a blackmail thing or something? </p></p>

        <p><p>I think part of the point is to throw people off of the scent with an outrageous "story."  Victims of ritual abuse by elites are often slapped in the face with "delusional" the second satanism is mentioned. </p></p>

        <p><p>Uh yea - it does sound stupid.  But satanism is pretty hack.  Its like what emo kids do in highschool - but when you have some of the most famous, wealthy, well-known and widely liked people in the world doing it, the list of reasons for doing it are pretty short.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to look into some ancient cultures or tribal cultures to see if there were any stories of satanism present.  Maybe there are some fables about people who gained power through satanism.  Maybe even revisit the salem witch trials and see if there is anything there.</p>
<p>I understand that we don't live in a movie - but what the fuck, man; we have to try to understand our enemy here</p></p>

        <p><p>Another poster says that it could work as a tool to make stories seem more unbelievable / discredit them. I find that to be a decent explanation. But I refuse to entertain the idea that the political elite are somehow religious fanatic satanists who sacrifice kids without more proof or explanation into it. becuase at the given moment it just seems too fucking farfetched. </p>
<p>But then again the podestas are fucking weirdos. </p></p>

        <p><p>Part of the problem with discussing 'satanism' here is that the word is conflated with everythig occult, everything supernatural, everything non-Christian.</p>
<p>But I keep getting yelled at here by people who prefer to tell me what it is other people actually believe rather than listening to what those people have to say and I've given up.</p>
<p>Satan is a bad lead here, the occult is a good one. Moloch is not Satan. Ancient Non-Abrahamic religions had no Satanism because they had no Satan. When we only view things from a Judeochristian perspective we can make false connections as easily as we dismiss real ones.</p></p>

        <p><p>Maybe there are higher beings who can influence our reality without us knowing. Kind of like you can mess with insects and they don't know what's going on.</p>
<p>Kind of egotistical to assume we're the highest beings, isn't it?</p></p>

        <p><p>My thoughts on it were twofold;</p>
<p>On the surface, as someone said, it's used to stop victim testimony from sounding credible. "Crazy Satanist politicians abducted me!"</p>
<p>More importantly, though, it's to build a sense of camaraderie between people doing terrible things. No one can or does jump into such detestable activities. Ceremony, religion, and indoctrination would be a vital part of desensitising 'recruits' while allowing the longer serving members to gather enough material to keep them locked in.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's hard to say. I've been doing a lot of digging, and I'm still unsure about this component.</p>
<p>My immediate thought is that it's used as a cover; to make witness testimonies outlandish and absurd that nothing short of the entire pile of evidence will convince the majority of people.</p>
<p>But that aside I've seen a lot of evidence that the people involved attach some kind of significance to the ritual components of this abuse network; John his brother Tony certainly seem to be big fans of the occult (John Podesta is a known UFO buff, which can be seen in some of the leaked emails in which he converses with UFO enthusiasts), and Jeffrey Epstein's island had a temple built on it.</p>
<p>The other thing that convinces me that these people at least partially believe in what they are practicing, is the frequent repetition of the same symbolism, primarily that involving eyes (expressed through gestures involving the covering of one eye or encircling one eye in some sort of gesture), owls (Bohemian Grove, Jeffrey Epstein's temple statue, genital mutilation of a woman claiming to be a rape victim of Hillary Clinton, and more), and pentagrams. It is my opinion that if the ritualistic elements of these cases of abuse were simply a cover, they wouldn't be so consistent but rather would do whatever sprung to mind that sounded the most absurd.</p>
<p>TL;DR It's hard to say as we are simply getting a glimpse into this network of VIPs, but they do seem to believe in what they practice. I wouldn't be surprised if some believe and some see it as just a cover, as it's important to remember that while loosely coordinated, these are separate, distinct groups; almost akin to terrorist cells.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's very strange but I see it popping up over and over and its almost hard to ignore, and I did see those emails about the UFO stuff too. There is weird symbolism in a lot of places, and their taste in art is as strange as it is disgusting (the podestas). I still dont get why they're so into the ritualistic shit, it doesnt add up at all. There has to be more to it. </p></p>

        <p><p>I agree. It's likely many of these people believe they have obtained power and influence through these practices. They are wealthy, famous, travel in the "right" circles, etc. I would imagine having power over those weaker than they are would fill them with a sense of self-importance and invulnerability. That would carry over into their work life, confidence level, ability to connect with other powerful people, etc.</p></p>

        <p><p>The sacrifice of the innocent, babies and children, is a key part of satanism. Pedophila is a way of stealing the innocence, purity, and Godliness of children. Whatever is sacred, good, is reversed and abused by the satanic. There's tons of info out there, just do some googling. Alex Jones has done shows on it, David Icke wrote about it, etc.</p></p>
