        <strong>Wanted to share a thought I had regarding the Heavy Breathing "Airtight" video</strong>
        <p><p>First and foremost, I searched this sub and this video was posted 2 days ago, but no one commented what I had noticed when I first watched this video last night.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/N_gGhrIO6ps?t=3m25s</p>
<p>Apart from the voice and the overly obvious euphemisms, I feel like this video is referencing some sort of streaming service and/or a delivery service for Heavy Breathing's album "Airtight." Now, one part of this video that shook me was commentary about the radius of distance they can "send" their album too.</p>
<p>Did anyone else notice this? Any thoughts towards this "streaming."  Some things from the video that really made me raise my eye brow were "<em>...about 15 minutes in length</em>"(why wouldn't they know the length to their own album??) and of course, the pictures used in the video. </p>
<p>I used a throwaway account, sorry for any grammatical errors, I just wanted to get what I noticed out to this sub. I do not want to immediately jump and say this video is advertising CP, this video is just really disturbing to me, along with the rest of the Heavy Breathing videos I watched. </p></p>

        <p><p>They are talking about their show not a album with the radius. The 15 minute thing is about a personal record based on your email. Have you even watched the video?</p></p>

        <p><p>I just wanted to add a few more thoughts.</p>
<p>This band seems like of the many "hipster" bands that I'm sure you'll find all over, in any place. You can take this video as a "left-field-edgyness" kind of thing. </p>
<p>To me though, this video seems to be like an <em>update</em> and I noticed that there seems to be one of the videos a year. (Again, they are band, they are just promoting themselves... right?). </p></p>
