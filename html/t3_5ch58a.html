        <strong>Worth checking into Trumps and Epsteins relationship</strong>
        <p><blockquote>
<p>“He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it ― Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been around here since it's start. I saw Epsteins name somewhere in here. I want someone with better sleuth skills to help me out. I started looking Trump up to see if any connections with his accusation of raping a 13 year old in 1994 could be connected in anyway. Epsteins name caused me to wonder. Another thing us that this girl is remaining anonymous...and also, doesn't seem like this ring let's kids out alive. It's worth a look.</p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>In 2010, Epstein pled the Fifth when asked by a lawyer representing one of Epstein's victims about his relationship with Trump:</p>
<ul>
<li>Q: Have you ever had a personal relationship with Donald Trump?</li>
<li>A. What do you mean by "personal relationship," sir?</li>
<li>Q. Have you socialized with him?</li>
<li>A. Yes, sir.</li>
<li>Q. Yes?</li>
<li>A. Yes, sir.</li>
<li>Q. Have you ever socialized with Donald Trump in the presence of females under the age of 18?</li>
<li>A: Though I'd like to answer that question, at least today I'm going to have to assert my Fifth, Sixth, and 14th Amendment rights, sir.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is definitely something to this. I have a feeling Trump is shitting himself as this keeps rising up in his own subreddit. His lack of acknowledgement on the issue makes me question him even more.</p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks for the info and this is so sketch. I'm questioning Trump as things go on as well. It's no way he doesn't know and the fact that his friends partipate as we know...it's bothersome. I wanna dig more on Trump.</p></p>

        <p><p>This worries the hell out of me.  I hope that they were just trying to falsely accuse him however, because he would not play ball.  He may have witness stuff.  Maybe he wants to take them out.</p></p>

        <p><p>If I'm not mistaken, I believe Trump kicked him out of some other club right after that. </p></p>

        <p><p><a href="https://news.vice.com/article/the-salacious-ammo-even-donald-trump-wont-use-in-a-fight-against-hillary-clinton-bill-clinton">Article about Epstein including ties to Trump</a> </p>
<p>Excerpt:
"Maxwell fled the United States on the eve of her deposition and never testified in Epstein's case. In fact, several of the Jane Doe lawyers, who spoke off the record because the case is ongoing, said that every key person investigators wanted to interview — especially those with potential knowledge of what took place on St. James Island — eluded subpoenas on technical grounds.</p>
<p>There was one exception: Donald Trump.</p>
<hr>
<p>Edwards, the lawyer for Roberts and about 10 other Jane Does, said that after he served Trump with the subpoena in 2009, Trump immediately contacted him.</p>
<p>"During the conversation, Mr. Trump was open and forthright," Edwards said. "I cannot discuss the substance of the conversation. But I will say that it was obvious to me that he was in no way involved in any untoward activity."</p>
<p>It appears that Trump cut ties to Epstein a few weeks after the non-prosecution agreement was reached. On October 15, 2007, the New York Post reported that Mar-A-Lago had barred Epstein because he hit on a masseuse at the club. Epstein denied to the the Post that he had been banned. One of the Jane Doe attorneys told VICE News a slightly different account, saying that he had been told Trump broke ties with Epstein after Epstein tried to pick up the underage daughter of a Mar-A-Lago club member."</p>
<p>It's very interesting and I'm going to keep digging, of course. Trump has said very often during his campaign that he used to be "on the other side", saw how terrible things are and it's why he was running. Did Trump stumble upon the elite pedo ring and cut ties to try and change it? Or was he, and is he, a player in it? Time will, hopefully, tell.</p>
<p>General Flynn made <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/GenFlynn/status/794000841518776320">this tweet</a>. Flynn is rumored to be apart of Trump's cabinet once he's POTUS - just saw on CNN but he would need a waiver to become Secretary of Defense. </p></p>

        <p><p>Given the tensions atm, perhaps we can verify some of this info before we pour more gas onto this fire.  People could be physically injured or killed. </p></p>

<p>The anonymous accuser who just happened to "step forward" (through a lawyer) during the election, canceled a press conference due to "threats", and <em>very possibly never existed at all</em>?</p>
<p>Seriously. There's zero evidence this person isn't completely made up.</p></p>
