        <p><p>We should spam the shit out of youtubers until someone of them starts to speak about it. I say <strong>Phillip Defranco, Steven Crowder, h3h3, Onision, Shane Dawson, Freelee the banana girl, even Jenna Marbles</strong>...</p>
<p>Steven Crowder does debunking political and social lies, he is veeery active on Twitter and has a show on youtube with 500k subsribers.</p>
<p>Shane Dawson has millions of subscribers from multiple channels + he started doing 'conspiracy theories' videos. </p>
<p>Freelee (700k subs) is hardcore vegan activist so maybe she would care for torture of humans too...</p>
<p>It doesn't really matter if you like any of youtubers, it's just important to spread to word.</p></p>
