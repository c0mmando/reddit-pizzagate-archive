        <strong>Watching Dreamwork's "Home" with the kid today, mouth wide open the whole time. I had to do some digging.</strong>
        <p><p>I had the morning off and decided to browse Netflix to find a movie for the kiddo and I to watch. We had seen the movie Home before, but it had been several months. Watching it again for the second time almost made me ill. Now that he is taking his nap, I have gone and looked at many background elements of the movie that caught my attention. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.giveasyoulive.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/home.jpg">The "O" in Home has the same spiral imagery, along with the same spiral on the chest of every one of the characters</a></p>
<p>That was the first thing that caught my attention. There are many illusions throughout the movie, including the main character, O, saying that his people "do not kidnap and abduct, we liberate and befriend" when talking to Rhianna's character from the small island of Barbados. Once I got to the specifics of my dig, I found some interesting things.</p>
<p>At one point in the movie, the two main characters are running from the authorities in the dark streets of New York. There are several neon company signs in the background, which made me curious. One of the signs was not lit, a <a href="https://puu.sh/spRTI/0c7e0cd118.png">Ximonox Inc</a></p>
<p>Typing in Ximonox Inc in google search yields <a href="https://puu.sh/spS7C/d710465a99.png">Two articles titled PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1053092/000095010309001744/0000950103-09-001744.txt">Actual Link to sec.gov text file</a></p>
<p><a href="https://puu.sh/spTuz/a0e9aad80a.png">JPMORG&amp;Chase handling securities</a></p>
<p>Interestingly enough, within the first one is about tax codes on securities regarding a banking firm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Suisse_First_Boston">Credit Suisse First Boston</a>, which was shut down in 2006 for tax evasion practices. The man in charge was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Quattrone">Frank Quattrone</a>, who never faced prison time for his multi charges of tax evasion. He was caught bribing jurors and the judge and still got off the hook.</p>
<p>More digging reveals that he is chairman of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California_Innocence_Project">Northern California Innocence Project</a>. You would never guess <a href="http://law.scu.edu/ncip/how-we-work/john-stoll/">what type of people he has saved from conviction!</a>.</p>
<p>Quattrone is a known supporter of the Clinton Foundation, and public enemy #2 right behind HRC of James Comey, director of FBI.</p>
<p>I will dig for more things hidden in the Movie, but this is a start for now.</p></p>

        <p><p>The lizard people could potentially be misinformation. Consider if a person who was raped by a democrat was brainwashed into thinking they were lizard people, or they were drugged into seeing them as lizard people.</p>
<p>Then while they might accuse them of rape and abuse they will also start to spout, these lizard people need to be stopped, they are human they are lizards. And by manipulating their minds to believe that lizard people are real, they create this reason to deny the accusations of the victim as a mental condition.</p></p>

        <p><p>Sorry, I think you are making a bunch of incorrect statements leading to links that do not exist.</p>
<p>First, Ximonox <strong>does not even appear in those first two links</strong>, do a ctrl f.  Those links are the raw data of SEC filings.  Ctrl f of "Ximo" in both reveal a "Ximobox" included in a long stream of data that appears to be the text version of a .jpg compression.  Google is just linking the closest things it can find.</p>
<p>Here are the same document in the regular format.  Neither Ximonox or Ximobox show up in a ctrl-f.</p>
<p>https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1053092/000095010309001744/dp14215_fwp-j87.htm</p>

<p>The Credit Suisse filing includes discussion of tax treatment of a security.  So does the JP Morgan one.  Almost all  such filings would include a tax description.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse Frist Boston was not shut down for tax evasion in 2006, it went through a reorganization and branding effort to be renamed Credit Suisse.  It later got ensnared in tax evasion cases.  Both events occurred long after Quattrone had left the firm, and related to divisions that had nothing to do with Quattrone.</p>
<p>Quattrone was in charge of CSFB's technology group, not the whole bank.  He was not prosecuted for tax evasion, but for securities claims related to IPOs in the first dotcom bubble.  He was not accused of bribing jurors or the judge.  On his first trial, he got a hung jury.  He lost the second, but won on appeal, based in part over arguments the jury instructions THE PROSECUTION put forth, and the judge supported, were erroneous.</p></p>

        <p><p>Looks like i got a lot of bad or misleading info from digging into quattrone, he did have weak ties to the tax evasion nonsense and I was able to find some more credible sources regarding that trial.</p>
<p>I still think the movie itself has hidden meanings, but this might be a dead end. Thank you for the help and input.</p></p>

        <p><p>1.) You got no evidence here.  Literally nothing in your links mentions the company in the movie.  </p>
<p>1a.)  Just because something has a swirl in it doesn't mean it's inspired by the CP symbols.  This is Jesus Toast.</p>
<p>2.) So what if they saved someone from being improperly prosecuted?  You can't call him a pedophile if the proof for their pedophilia is from the very shoddy investigation that exonerated him.</p></p>

        <p><p>i thought u just found a random erotic novel and then i seen this part</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Story of O is a tale of female submission involving a beautiful Parisian fashion photographer named O, who is taught to be constantly available for oral, vaginal, and anal intercourse, offering herself to any male who belongs to the same secret society as her lover. She is regularly stripped, blindfolded, chained and whipped; her anus is widened by increasingly large plugs; her labium is pierced and her buttocks are branded.</p>
<p>At the climax, O is presented as a sexual slave, nude but for an owl-like mask and a leash attached to her piercing, before a large party of guests who treat her solely as an object</p>

        <p><p>I'm calling confirmation bias on this one.<br>
What benefit is there to hiding incriminating evidence in kids movies? Why put evidence of your crimes in <em>any</em> movie?  </p>
<p>Unless it's someone at Dreamworks trying to provide hints to investigators??</p></p>

        <p><p>That was my only reasoning to dig when the movie had such blatant imagery of the swirl all over it. I am still looking into things, such as a sign mentioning "The Indigo Tree Hotel" and "Cyan Theatre".</p>
<p>There has to be at least someone involved in production that isn't a piece of shit but still fears for their lives at the same time. I have faith in humanity still. </p></p>

        <p><p>I want people to look mainly into the link of Ximonox and it's ties to swiss banking, money laundering, and off-shore accounts for hiding money, and it's ties to Frank Quattrone. Someone involved in the production of this movie left this here to be found and needs to be looked into. If someone with a finance background could look into the archive more, it talks a lot about basket currency, which include the Ruble, Yen, Yuan, and Rupee (china, india, japan, russia), and how you can avoid federal income tax and avoid the IRS. I believe this might be what trump was alluding to in his debate speeches on how billionaires were hiding their money and how the effect of currency manipulation, i.e. George Soros, could have played a roll around the time this took place.</p></p>
