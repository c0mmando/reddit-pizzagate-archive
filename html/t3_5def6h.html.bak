        <strong>Comet Ping Pong is on a diagonal path to the White House. Could there be tunnels that go directly to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?</strong>

        <p><p>Google says it is a 1 hr, 42 min walk going straight down Connecticut Avenue, so it would be roughly the same underground. I highly doubt it.</p></p>

        <p><p>Possibly, though our strongest link to Obama is still just that one Stratfor email, and leaks suggest he has a poor relationship with Clinton in private. I'm really skeptical that Obama is involved in general, though I'm willing to be more open-minded if more stuff does surface.</p>
<p>I do know there is a private subway network under DC specifically for the higher ups. It's not super secure or anything, as I was able to ride it as a kid with one of my friends because his mom was good friends with a congressman. (And before anyone asks, no, nothing shady happened.)</p>
<p>It does provide a good cover, though, in terms of any sort of servicing or engineering work that would have to be done to these private tunnels, though.</p></p>

        <p><p>That is my line of thinking as well.  Also, what I failed to point out in my initial post, is that if you were to draw a line directly as the crow flies to The White House, it is almost a perfect diagonal shot.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Anything that isn't directly N/S/E/W from a given location will be a "perfect diagonal shot" from it by definition. The whole point of talking about measurements "as the crow flies" is that it is a measurement of the "perfect" path.</p></p>

        <p><p>Fair point, but it is hard to create a direct path from one place to another, without infrastructure already in place that lends itself to such paths.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Wrong!!!!! There are hundreds and hundreds of miles of undergrpund tunnels that nobody knows about! Aprx 200 underneath St. Paul, Minnesota alone. DC is an old city and there are old tunnels everywhere. Just google Dupont underground. And then look at the bands who have recorded in their "Underground Sessions". And the Kids stuck out to me right away. Creepy lyrics, song titles and everything.</p></p>

        <p><p>ok, well, you are wrong in asserting that any distance underground is too far for there to be a tunnel, or if your assertion is that an hour and a half walk is too far for most people to consider, just condider the lengths they have gone to keep their pedo tendencies secret...</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, I am contradicting you! I am calling your doubts that an underground tunnel system could or would be used to be completely and unjustifiably incorrect. You didn't even provide information to assert your claim. You said you highly doubt an underground network of tunnels exist or that it would be used because the distance is an hour and a half walk. If you want to look up info on underground DC, you won't even need to go that far to realsize that COG planning has been going on since the 50's and there is tons of shit underneath all big cities. I guess you don't like being called wromg so much that you are trying to paint me as a turning you into a strawman even though I have addressed your point exactly. If I were strawmanning you I would've brought up an entirely different point.</p></p>

<p>I told you the first time I replied that I posted elsewhere in this thread (these comments still exist) before you even commented recognizing the tunnels' existence and even talking about going into some myself.</p>
<p>You're just digging yourself into a deeper hole. I'll admit, though, it's hilarious to watch!</p></p>

        <p><p>well I either missed that or you changed the comment saying you went through other tunnels as a kid. Glad youre having a good time and I am entertaining you though! I have never heard a normal redditor paint themselves as a strawman though. are you in politics? how could you doubt that there is a system of underground transportation when you personally experienced it? why do you express doubt? I am still unclear. Call me dumb, but I just can't figure it out.</p></p>

        <p><p>Can you tell me more about DuPont underground?  Knowing what Jon Dupont did, I'm sure I can guess what it entails, but want to get some info on it.  Do you have some links you can send our way?</p></p>
