        <strong>Just an interesting result from looking up local arrests for pedophilia...</strong>
        <p><p>I decided to look into local pedophilia arrests because my city, while not large, has a problem with crime and pedo/ rape.  Just putting in "Pedophilia arrests in____, AL" I got back a couple of arrest records databases.  The third result was for an Escape Room experience, which I thought was odd.  The Escape Rooms here are only solving puzzles, not scary at all.  There is no correlation I can find about the owners and arrests.  Maybe it's because of the finding criminals?  I know the algorithms can spew out the odd result and especially if it's been paid for top results.  But this is pedophilia.  Not something anyone wants to be associated with. I just found it extremely weird and it's stuck in my craw. </p>
<p>Does anyone else get results that are a little odd when looking for pedophilia arrests?</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm from Alabama as well. I work near one of those escape rooms. I know of at least three in Birmingham alone.</p></p>
