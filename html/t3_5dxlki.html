        <strong>The people of Haiti even have a name for the often US connected kidnapping that troubles the country, they call it; Ayisyen kidnape, Blan fè pri.</strong>
        <p><p>It roughly translates as: Haitian kidnapped, whites named the price. </p>
<p>And if you went down the rabbit hole and started looking at the highly organized network of kidnapping and mafia associations that exist in Haiti you would find that its almost always tied to the extremely well financed elite. <a href="http://www.ezilidanto.com/2014/08/haiti-oligarch-clifford-brandt-smuggled-prison/">Clifford Brandt</a> is a man who was convicted of kidnapping and ran one of these rings and was sent to prison a few years ago, a prison which he later escaped in a very brazen and public display. His family is a collection of billionaires and financial oligarches that dominate Haitis social landscape, and unsurprisingly he also happened to be a very close friend to <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/13/how-hillary-helped-ruin-haiti.html">Michel Martelly</a>. A man who by all accounts was quite forcefully and undemocratically elected via Hillary Rodham Clintons influence in the Haitian Government and himself is deeply tied to organized kidnapping rings and the haitian mafia. And just like we see in washington DC, the people that are appointed into positions of oversight for these crimes are [complicity involved] (http://www.haitiobserver.com/blog/tag/marc-arthur-phebe)in the very activities theyve been sworn to fight against. It also goes much farther then the kidnapping of children. <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/05/gold-mine-hillary-clintons-brother-granted-super-rare-mining-permit-from-haiti-after-state-dept-sent-country-billions/">Tony Rodham</a>, owner of a business that barely exists on paper, was given full rights to a haitian gold mine while Martelly was president, and has drained every penny he could out of the country, shafting every single haitian involved in the operation. The Clintons coereced this by abusing their position in the US government through threats of US disengagement, and used Martelly to see it put through haitian senate even though the government was collectively outraged at the deal. </p>
<p>This is just the tip of the icebergs gents, and I implore you to shift your focus to Haiti and the extremely well established and financed kidnapping rings that exist there. This is the result of barely 2 hours of digging. I'll post more as I uncover it, but for now Im gonna get some rest. We're on to something big here. Comet ping pong is nothing but a small time gig in the broader picture of child trafficking. Of which the Clintons are deeply involved in, and as I imagine, a great deal of the former US administration.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Great research. There is a Haitian social political blogger at thehaitianblogger.com she compiles amazing local insight and is strongly opposed to the Clintons.</p>
<p>I found a lead the other day about a Club Azure that sits right by a lake known as a child trafficking hub. I will copy and paste here in a second, but the names you mentioned here might connect to it. </p>
<p>I have only started one thread in this subreddit, but I have dedicated a lot of research to the Haitian leads. Sorry for the long text here.</p>
<p>On a lake known globally for being a huge hub for child trafficking, where the entire surrounding population is in extreme poverty, is there a swanky resort club? They even advertise the prices on the website? 7k for a bedroom? I can't even find the prices on some steak dinners at restaurants locally where I am at. This "swanky" place is VERY close to Lake Azuei, which is also baffling scientists with is rapid rising water levels. Seems like the worst place on the world to invest on trying to attract rich clients... Unless of course they are rich pedophiles. </p>
<p>Also the website is extremely terrible for a resort charging such high fees. I am not very good at finding the domains and technical aspect of these things, if anyone could help with that on this website it could be beneficial for the investigation.</p>
<p>On their facebook they have also posted a lot about the Clinton Foundation. During my work here I have found SO many haitians have deep hatred for that foundation, and it is widely known how badly they have been scammed. Why post so positively about them as Haitians?</p>
<p>Also having a hard time locating this on Google Maps. When you just search for a Club Azure, it locates one location in the states and one in the UK. When I look at the map on their website and go through that, its not on there. When I search for it manually on google sattelite, I am not finding anything remotely like it. </p>
<p>If you were a company seeking wealthy clients, you damn well would make sure you pop up in google searches. Their facebook states the development should be pretty much at completion right now. I am seeing no signs of this place. </p>

        <p><p>Yes, indeed, and the Clintons' connection with Haiti goes back a long way. Hillary and Bill spent their honeymoon there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the strange circle of life, it all comes back to Haiti. When Bill Clinton married Hillary Rodham in 1975, a friend gave them a trip to Haiti. Since that honeymoon vacation, the Caribbean island nation has held a life-long allure for the couple, a place they found at once desperate and enchanting, pulling at their emotions throughout his presidency and in her maiden year as secretary of state.</p>
<p>The Clintons' enthrallment has lasted for more than 30 years. They decorated their homes with Haitian art. They flew back again and again. Hillary Clinton once said that theirs was a "Haiti-obsessed family." </p>

        <p><p>Besides the lax child trafficking laws, perhaps another reason why the elite seems to love Haiti is because of their voodoo culture. Evidence suggests the elite believe in the occult; what if they're into voodoo as well? How much of that "Haitian art" in the Clinton's home has religious voodoo significance?</p></p>

        <p><p>There is this whole 'Restavek' thing in Haiti as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A restavek (or restavec) is a child in Haiti who is sent by his or her parents to work for a host household as a domestic servant because the parents lack the resources required to support the child.</p>
<p>many restaveks live in poverty, may not receive proper education, and are at grave risk for physical, emotional, and sexual abuse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restavek</p>
<p>The Restavek Foundation was created by Jean-Robert Cadet to help these children.</p>
<p>Human trafficking is rife in Haiti, especially between there and the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence_in_Haiti#Human_trafficking</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is rare for human traffickers to be prosecuted in Haiti because the country does not have laws specifically banning the practice, and those laws that could be used against traffickers go unenforced.</p>
</blockquote></p>

        <p><p>Check out former PA Governor Ed Rendell's news story from around 2010 about semi-illegally airlifting Haitian "orphans" out of Haiti after the huge earthquake there. It was found that some children didn't have paperwork expressing parental approval of these international adoptions of their children. Also check out Ed Rendell's connection to alleged child trafficker Ed Savitz. Ed Rendell is a huge supporter of Hillary. I think this is an important place to start digging (more in my post history for those who are interested in this particular rabbit hole).</p></p>

        <p><p>I've been developing an elaborate theory involving Monica Petersen, mango trees, Caracol, Haiti, mangos, Pakistan, Clinton Foundation, the Podestas and Amrita and Ashok Mahbubani. Just thought I'd share it in case any of it makes any sense. I cut and pasted the following from another thread where I've been collecting my thoughts:</p>
<p>According to Monica Petersen's friend who posted an alleged report from Monica which is shown here, Monica was in the "Caracol Complex", chiefly, a garment factory, investigating the Clinton Foundations's activities, when she died:</p>
<p>http://www.alternativenewsnetwork.net/woman-investigating-clinton-foundation-child-trafficking-found-dead/</p>
<p>(Al-Jazeera also reported on the scandal-ridden project:</p>
<p>http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/9/10/a-glittering-industrialparkfallsshortinhaiti.html)</p>
<p>Interestingly, Caracol was mentioned in a report written by a journalist named JEAN-LOUIS WARNHOLZ in the Clinton Wikileaks emails and forwarded by Cheryl Mills to Hillary Clinton:</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/19339</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two "mango trees" are discussed in a cryptic manner in this email: "Only two mango trees had to be uprooted at the Caracol Park. Trees under threat are now being transplanted to the Caracol Ekam housing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another email Cheryl Mills forwards Hillary a report filed by Jacqueline Charles in the Miami Herald on the new industrial park in Caracol.</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/4753</p>
<p>Caracol apparently had the reputation of being a prostitution center:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No matter the drawbacks, Caracol, however you look at it, is more than a positive step," said businessman Rudolph Boulos, a former senator for the northeast region. "The fact that the people have less and less to do — no agriculture, no work. Even with the sea next door, Caracol has become a brothel of the North and Northeast."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Is it possible the "mango trees" in Caracol are human trafficking mills that had to be moved to another location in Caracol to avoid notice?</strong></p></p>

        <p><p>In 2013, during my longest stay in Haiti, a colleague and I were asked to periodically check on the progress of houses just like these (not built by USAID). The houses were always behind schedule and poorly built. They cut corners every way they could. The project manager (a Haitian) was very odd and dressed incredibly flashy for being a "local". He bent over backwards to make it look like money was being spent correctly. Common practice.</p>
<p>EDIT: Houses were in Croix-de-Bouquets (in the countryside just outside of Port-au-Prince)</p></p>

        <p><p>I've wondered for a while if "mangos" are a code word for human merchandise, or for drugs:</p>
<p>Amrita and Ashok Mahbubani, who were involved with the Casa Podesta Pizza Party and sent pictures "which revealed the spirit of the evening", prepared and cooked an elaborate Indian dinner at Tony Podesta's house in D.C. which required the use of a pizza oven and featured "fresh, sweet mango" as the dessert.</p>
<p>It doesn't stop there: the Mahbubani's have their own foundation, EKTA, which operates in Haiti:</p>
<p>http://www.ektafoundationusa.org/main/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In their path to the present, the Mahbubanis developed a bond with Haiti, through a family owned manufacturing business that employed 300 people there in the '80s. In this, the poorest country in our hemispehere, the EKTA Foundations has made measurable impact working with stellar partners - the Haitian Education &amp; Leadership Program (HELP), Inveneo and Water.org - to change ground realities for the better. Perhaps more fulfilling is the experience of seeing Haitians at all levels strive to take charge of their destiny, directing their irrepressible spirit to rebuild their country as they find their new place in the world."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lo and behold, Inveneo, one of the Mahbubani's programs under the auspices of the EKTA Foundation, has an office in Caracol:</p>
<p>http://www.inveneo.org/partners/local-partners/</p></p>

        <p><p>I became very suspicious of "mangos" because of an email in the Clinton emails detailing the establishment of a USAID mango distribution program in Pakistan which created a pipeline from Pakistan to NYC and Texas.</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/6195</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This season the price is high and supply is targeted to stores in New York and Texas, but it will go down significantly next year and beyond. I've attached three photos for you. The design on the boxes is a bit cheesy but I thought RCH would have gotten a kick out of it. =)"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I believe "RCH" refers to Richard Holbrooke, envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan who had died a few months previously.)</p>

        <p><p>In conclusion, I have a theory that the Clinton Foundation, perhaps in conjunction with the Mahbubani's EKTA Foundation, et al.,  set up a human trafficking ring in Caracol and used "mango trees" as the code word for the human trafficking houses.</p>
<p>USAID is heavily involved in the Caracol Complex industrial park project, and it's possible USAID shipping containers were used to ship humans along with garments and mangoes being transported to other parts of the world and to stores in the U.S., including Gap, Walmart, Target and others. FBI Anon, if I'm not mistaken, suggested this as an avenue for us to investigate.</p>
<p>The USAID-supported Mango Muavan Program in Pakistan established by the Clinton State Dept. which ships "Mystic Mangos" to U.S. markets may also be part of an international pipeline of human trafficking and drug smuggling.</p></p>

        <p><p>P.S. This Al-Jazeera article below is very informative and talks in some detail about the Caracol Complex industrial park which Monica was investigating.</p>
<p>Among the items of interest: it has a new airport and a port which apparently the U.S. govt had some difficulty building since they hadn't built a port in three decades. Very handy to have your own airport and port, I would say.</p>
<p>http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/9/10/a-glittering-industrialparkfallsshortinhaiti.html</p>
<p>Just a little bit more about the transportation hubs conveniently located near the Caracol Industrial Park:</p>
<p>http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-6984-haiti-economy-the-sonapi-proud-of-its-caracol-industrial-park.html</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a land size of 622 acres, the Caracol Industrial Park fits geographically and economically in the heart of a true dynamic technopolis in the Greater North of Haiti, just a few miles from the new Henry Christophe university campus. In Cap Haitian, the airport can now accommodate larger carriers and the region offers high tourism potential to cruise ships docking in Labadie. In addition, construction of a new port facility is very far advanced into being a reality.</p>

        <p><p>In addition, I wonder if the multiple "Costco" and "Safeway" references in the Podesta emails may be code for warehouses where the pedophiles picked up human trafficking victims. Very far-fetched, I know, but this Mother Jones article raised some questions in my mind:</p>
<p>http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/wikileaks-cooking-podesta-clinton-risotto</p>
<p>Even Mother Jones thinks it's extraordinary that such wealthy, powerful people were clipping coupons from Safeway and shopping at Costco. Maybe it's perfectly innocent, but maybe these are covers for something else.</p>
<p>These ideas have been percolating in my head for a while now, and I'm beginning to see possible connections. Thought I'd just throw it out there for whatever it's worth.</p></p>

        <p><p>I've discovered more on Costco, which I mentioned above. It piqued my interest because it was mentioned several times in the Podesta emails and because of the Mother Jones article above.</p>
<p>Amrita Mahbubani went to the Costco in Fairfax to get chicken, lamb and fish for the elaborate Indian dinner she was "cooking" for Tony Podesta at his D.C. house. This was the dinner which required the use of a pizza oven. The address is given in the email.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amrita typically shops for fish/meats here at Costco where she knows where to find what she wants. I see the closest one is at 1200 South Fern Street, Arlington, VA 2220</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just discovered today that Hillary has done several book signings at the same Costco in Fairfax.</p>
<p>http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/06/hillary-clinton-costco-walmart
http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/hillary-clinton-book-tour-107866</p>
<p>I'm just theorizing here, but wouldn't it be cozy if the international human trafficking pipeline delivered their merchandise to this Costco for Washington customers?</p>
<p>The founder of Costco held a $50,000/plate fundraiser for Hillary in March of this year: </p>
<p>http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2016/03/15/a-private-reception-with-hillary-clinton-costs-50.html</p>
<p>The co-founder and former CEO of Costco spoke at the 2012 Democrat convention.</p></p>

        <p><p>Final thought: Tony Podesta's address is 2438 Belmont rd NW Washington 20008. The Costco is at 1200 South Fern Street, Arlington, VA 22202. That's 15 minutes away by Google Maps.</p>
<p>The circle, if there is one, may get even cosier: A NY Times article reported that the Obama's will be moving from the White House to a house a few doors away from Tony's house.</p>

        <p><p>Speaking of EKTA, the Mahbubani's foundation, the word "ekta" is defined on their website as </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hindi noun (pronounced ayk-tha): a purposeful unity; solidarity; a melding of people in pursuit of a common cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The funny thing is that "Ekam", the name for the housing in Caracol, is also a Hindu word, meaning "the supreme oneness."</p></p>

        <p><p>Just looking up the origins of the word "Ekam" and found something VERY interesting. The temple of the Hindu supreme god, the Lord Shiva, is <strong>"Ekambaram", or "Lord of the Mango Tree"</strong>.</p>
<p>So, the Caracol-EKAM housing project which Monica Petersen was investigating has an interesting connection to the mango tree.</p>
<p>Remember the mysterious email from Cheryl Mills to Hillary Clinton where mango trees are discussed:</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/19339</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Only two mango trees had to be uprooted at the Caracol Park. Trees under threat are now being transplanted to the Caracol Ekam housing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this could all be totally innocuous; hypothetically, however, is it possible that Amrita and Ashok Mahbubani who operate a charitable foundation in Haiti,the EKTA foundation (another Hindu word), have an intimate connection with the EKAM housing project? </p>
<p>And is it possible that "mango tree" means temporary housing for children ("mangos") in the Caracol-Ekam housing project who are about to be passed into the international pipeline--- stowed away in USAID shipping containers in the Caracol factory warehouses and delivered to the nearby Cap-Haitien airport for transport around the globe?</p></p>

        <p><p>The Mango Tree Village Orphanage in Port-au-Prince in Haiti features a picture of Bill Clinton prominently on the front page of the website:</p>

<p>There is even a video of happy Haitian children entitled "The Mangos": </p>

        <p><p>The mango tree has great spiritual significance in the Hindu religion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This captivating fruit tree is mystical and fascinating: Mango is the food of the gods. The Mango tree is the symbol of love, wealth, fertility and even immortality. ... </p>

        <p><p>One further question: is it possible that Ashok and Amrita Mahbubahni who cooked an elaborate Indian dinner at Tony Podesta's DC house which required the use of his pizza oven, and which featured "fresh, sweet mango" for dessert were actually participating in a ghoulish Hindu ritual instead?</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3071</p>
<p>N.B. There are some scholars who see similarities and a possible connection between Hinduism and the Voodoo cult in Haiti.</p></p>

        <p><p>Just found something fascinating: Kristin Peterson is the CEO and founder of Inveneo, a program in Haiti under the auspices of the EKTA Foundation (owned by Amrita and Ashok Mahbubani). Could she be the sister of Monica Petersen (with a variant spelling)? </p></p>

<p>Knows a guy who knows a guy connections are fine too. An infographic is being built to try and have critical links to Clinton's ties to the Rape of Haiti.</p></p>

        <p><p>Re: Clinton Foundation connection, it might be that they enable or cover for human trafficking more than being directly involved.  Or all of the above.</p></p>
