        <strong>COMET PING PONG PUTTING BODILY FLUID IN THE PIZZA? An advisory commissioner testified that Alefantis spit in a customer's food! They dismissed the commissioner as "whacky" (just like they do to us) - maybe he was telling the truth this whole time?</strong>
        <p><p>I'm very saddened to report this...</p>
<p>As I watched a recent video of comet ping pong I became nauseated. Alefantis looks very sickly in my opinion. He has a pale complexion and his nose appears to be chapped or pink it seems, as if he were sick or possibly diseased. http://www.greatamericancountry.com/video/pizza-at-comet-ping-pong-0207483</p>
<p>His boyfriend David Brock also looks sickly and clammy for that matter http://www.powerlineblog.com/ed-assets/2016/09/david-brock.jpg</p>
<p>Watching the white globs of goo / dough spilling all over the sides of the container like that, and then seeing him reach his bare hands inside. </p>
<p>My immediate concern was food safety protocols.  Whether the food being served here might be hazardous, or exposed to harmful bacteria, bodily fluid, etc?</p>
<p>Then seeing that photo on the instagram of a slice of pizza literally on a naked man's genitals. (WARNING: NSFW) https://dcpizzagate.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/image2-1.png?w=840</p>
<p>It makes me sick to my stomach imagining someone eating that pizza and not knowing where it has been. </p>
<p>I hate to have to be the one who brings this up. </p>
<p>But sure enough... I found an old report that few seem to have noticed. </p>
<p>Advisory Commissioner Mr. Frank Winstead went ON RECORD and gave a testimony that James Alefantis was contaminating customer food, specifically stating that there was spit in the food. See his testimony here: http://archive.is/CJR5R</p>
<p>(Note that Alefantis tried to claim that the commissioner was "whacky." (A tactic we have come to expect from these people.))</p>
<p>Also, many of you are familiar with Amanda Kleinman's creepiest video by far, where she talks about a "puppet" with sharp teeth, and how it gets angry sometimes, how it has some kind of immune deficiency or problem. (AIDS?) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Zg0IYRiY4Y . </p>
<p>I don't know why she would post such disturbing content, but the fact that she is also so close to comet ping pong, despite such creepy themes in her videos, is worrying. </p>
<p>The thought of these people so much as TOUCHING the food makes me feel like puking.</p>
<p>I am inclined to suspect that Mr. Winstead might not be as crazy as they made him seem, but was rather a very concerned citizen. The man seems to keep a meticulous eye on anything strange occurring in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>It is not obvious to me that he is "whacky." </p>
<p>I really hate to go here, but I see no reason to doubt his testimony that spit was placed in the food at comet ping pong.</p>
<p>If it turns out these people are so sadistic as to be contaminating the food back in that kitchen, as part of some mass spread of sickness? ....  I just don't even want to think about it.</p>
<p>I am genuinely concerned right now. Especially for all the people who have eaten there who are constantly reassured that it is "family friendly."</p>
<p>I'll put it this way. If it were me, and I accidentally ate there, I would go get my health tested ASAP. </p></p>

        <p><p>Btw comet ping pong supporters actually <em>showed up to Mr. Winstead's private residence</em> after he told the public that Alefantis was contaminating the food.</p>
<p>A male and someone else with a camera (supporters of comet ping pong?) literally lurked near Mr. Winstead's front door.  They recorded him for several minutes, even after he wanted privacy. In my book this is harassment. They also recorded a girl friend or loved one that was visiting Mr. Winstead. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ftrcg0nB93w&amp;t=0m45s</p>
<p>(Folks, let this be a lesson. These people ARE capable of coming after you or your loved ones. Would strongly suggest taking self-defensive precautions if you have reason to believe you are being targeted.)</p></p>

        <p><p>Mr Winstead also said they were promoting rape and murder. Really scary stuff.</p>
<p>To be honest though, people would be lucky if all they got was spit in the pizza. Wouldn't be surprised if their tomato sauce had blood or meat of humans in the mix.</p></p>

        <p><p>I wasn't going to say it, but that's exactly what I was wondering too. </p>
<p>Could they be putting drops of contaminated blood in the pizza and exposing thousands of people in the city?</p>
<p>If the blood drops were mixed in the sauce, nobody would ever notice.</p>
<p>Remember when a company was caught putting HIV blood in their product? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg-52mHIjhs</p>
<p>Can't say anything for sure. But the possibility is frightening.</p></p>

        <p><p>Seriously? It's pretty well-known science that HIV cannot survive outside the human body and yet here you are implying that it could be transmitted after being put into pizza sauce and cooked. Your predictions are demonstrably false and frankly, this constitutes paranoid delusion. </p>

<p>HIV transmission requires direct access for the virus to enter the bloodstream. The virus cannot survive outside of the human body and cannot survive in a glass of soda.</p>

        <p><p>The virus would still be carried in the blood! Nobody's saying they would isolate it. And who said they were cooking it? It would just take some drops on the food after it is prepared. Please stop with your uninformed posts. You have no interest in rational inquiry and asking hard questions, it is obvious. </p></p>

        <p><p>I try to refrain from talking politics in this subreddit but it really is weird when someone that does little on Reddit except post on the "EnoughTrumpSpam" subreddit and insult Donald Trump on the default subreddits comes here and attempts to paint this Pizzagate business as a bunch of crazy, delusional junk. Very suspicious, some might say. Groups that get paid to protect certain individuals in politics online are very real and are still very active, after all. It is not out of the question that their focus may have changed towards protecting other people involved with the Foundation after the election.</p></p>

        <p><p>I was thinking this too. </p>
<p>Since marina abramovic's art includes so much cannibalism, I wouldn't be surprised if they are cooking the children. </p>
<p>That podesta email where they talk about the pasta better al dente too. Could that be referencing cooking the kids raw(alive) vs after they have died? I know that sounds insane, but I think it's definitely a possibility they are eating or cooking the children. Someone should definitely test the food.</p></p>

        <p><p>Oh my god, that's insane...</p>
<p>I feel sorry for Frank Winstead. He knew about this creepy fucker all along, but no one believed him.</p>
<p>Let me link to my thread because I think it's relevant, but in the audio recordings of the neighborhood meeting in 2008, Frank Winstead claims Alefantis is trying to run a rape and murder in his restaraunt. Afterwards he receives multiple attacks from the same writer from Washington Post. You'd also notice that during the meetings he brought his supporters to overwhelm Winstead to get permission to operate the joint after midnight, and this rich guy called Michael Maccoby stood up to threaten him as well.</p>

        <p><p>I wonder if he was completely sane, discovered something very creepy or sickening, and then they harassed him so much that they drove him insane. </p>
<p>I'm not really delving into the mind control stuff, but... maybe they got to him and screwed with his psyche so nobody would believe him?</p></p>
