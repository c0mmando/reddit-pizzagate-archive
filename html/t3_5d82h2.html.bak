        <strong>Evidence to support claim that WikiLeaks no longer controls the twitter account.</strong>
        <p><p>During their AMA they were posed the question regarding PizzaGate and they said they weren't aware of it before yet it was curious.</p>
<p>Found in a WikiLeak dump already published, information on missing child Maddie McCann:</p>
<p>https://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Madeleine_Beth_McCann_final_Portuguese_police_investigation_report_summary_2008</p>
<p>They would have mentioned the data had it been actually wikileaks in control.</p></p>

        <p><p>Wikileaks must have clearly been following the case and saw the Madeline McCann leads.</p>
<p>Someone there surely would have known they had pertinent information.</p>
<p>No?</p></p>

        <p><p>Because that is seen as one of our best pieces of evidence against Podesta. Doesnt make a difference if the parents had prior arrangements with the Podestas. We live in a figged up world. This board is compromised just like 4 chan and others. Just was commenting on a post that magically vanished</p></p>
