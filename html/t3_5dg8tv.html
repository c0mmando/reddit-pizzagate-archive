        <p><p>People fucked this thing up from the beginning. Leaving comments like "We know what you are doing" or "We are watching you". Why couldn't this have been more organized. Slowly gathering evidence. Trying to infiltrate them. Try to find concrete evidence, release it and contact the authorities.  </p>
<p>Instead. They are now probably burning all the evidence. Getting more cautious. Stopping their gatherings. Suspicious of newcomers. This is kind of fucked.</p></p>

        <p><p>The only people to blame aside from those carrying out this heinous depravity is the police and government officials who covered it up for as long as they did. It shouldn't have even been the case that this ever got leaked to the public before the intelligence agencies did something about it. Now, it just turns out that they're in on the fun, too. Hopefully we see change by or around Jan 20th. Otherwise, Trump is sweeping this under the rug.</p></p>

        <p><p>Agreed, the more substantial evidence that can be found the better. The evidence being uncovered today could lead to the end of this whole thing. </p></p>

        <p><p>Hmm just thought of something (this is just wild theory no evidence)</p>
<p>What if the FBI let's the investigation go on online so we fuck it up so they can close up holes and sweep it under the rug.</p></p>

<p>According to /pol/ the whole dc metro area and the points of interests make a pentagram.  We may have delayed the apocolypse by ten years.</p></p>
