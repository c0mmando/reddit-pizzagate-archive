        <strong>Podesta invited to a late night "dinner" at Comet pizza in October 2008. Featuring "big or small. You decide" the same month as Eric McFadden was arranging sex with a minor. These emails have it all. (3 emails). More in the comments...</strong>

        <p><p>Where are the other emails?</p>
<p>It looks like Palimeri wasn't clued in? She can't understand why such a meeting would garner such large donations?</p>
<p>The part about having dinner at my "places" says it for me. As in "take your pick from the gay or srtaight venues and adults or children". </p></p>

<p>No, as in, the two restaurants he owns that are on the same block as the bookstore where Podesta was giving a reading from his book.</p>
<p>Of course, you've been told that he's a pedophile and how everything is really in code, so that's how you're going to see it.</p>
<p>Whether it is or not.</p></p>

        <p><p>I eat pizza (actual pizza) at least once a week. Sometime order in, sometimes out with friends. I don't have a single email or text in the entirety of my phone that mentions pizza. </p>
<p>There are several referencing the restaurant we go to "Gino's" but never actually the word pizza. Just sayin.</p></p>

        <p><p>"Would you like to have a dinner at my places?!?</p>
<p>Big or small. What do you think?"</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>"I can probably get there around 8:30. Love to do somethind after
politics and prose. Catch up on that early in the week."</p>
<p>Reading James's questions they wouldn't make sense to John if it wasn't an understood code.  Unless they had had a recent conversation to a degree that "big or small" would immediately make sense.  I don't believe that's the case.</p>
<p>Looking at John's responses, he seems to answer the big or small question with, "Catch up on that early in the week".  He uses "that" instead of a more specific word. When two people have conversations that they both know what each other is talking about without it making sense at all on a general read they are talking in code.  There aren't many things they could be talking about that they have formed a habit of doing to the point they recognize the code immediately.</p></p>

        <p><p>Another oddity -- they're having "a dinner" would have to take place rather late at night. </p>
<p>You can infer this because they were going to watch the vice presidential debate beforehand, which lasted 90 minutes. </p>
<p>And started around 8. </p>
<p>So that means they would have "a dinner" at "places" around 11pm-midnight, and it would involve some x that is "big or small."</p>
