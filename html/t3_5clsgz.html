        <strong>What about China's One Child policy?</strong>
        <p><p>I've been reading through the information on here and trying to view things from the "big picture".  If this truly is a global organization, wouldn't they easily benefit from China's One Child policy?  We know that many parents had to get rid of children and I'm guessing some would even go as far as selling their young girls or excess kids.  I have absolutely no links or leads or proof of this happening but I wanted to share this thought in case it helps anyone looking for new leads.  Does the CF have any ties to China or surrounding countries? </p></p>
