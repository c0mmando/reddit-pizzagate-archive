        <strong>The attacks on the catholic church in the last years were a diversion from the real perpetrators!</strong>
        <p><p>First of all: I am pretty sure there are pedos in the catholic church (like everywhere else), and even secret satanists, but I don't believe for a second that it has more of them than than politics, globalized industry and entertainment does!</p>
<p>Notice the pattern: Pedo scandals by some backwater priests are talks in the press for ages, while pedo scandals in entertainment are rarely mentioned and abuse by industry magnates isn't even theorized about - despite all these testimonies by former victims.</p>
<p>These disproportionate attacks on the church are the delibate. Think about it: What faith gets constantly trashed in the popular media, which is vilified the most? Catholic Christianity (think Dan Brown etc.)</p>
<p>Which faith gets constantly mocked the most by these illuminati types the most? Catholicism (think "Alejandro" by Lady Gaga and so on)</p>
<p>And why? Because the catholic church kept these fuckers at bay when it was in power for almost 1500 years! Think about it. All this propaganda about the inquisition, exorcism the index and witch burnings. Now we see what happens when these loons are on the lose and free to do what they want!</p>
<p>Given all the occult shit we are witnessing now - maybe lots of those witches, warlocks and mages being dealth with during the inqusition was a good thing actually? For every Galileo, there were probably tens of "pizzas".</p>
<p>Yeah, I was an atheist too once, but then I digged deeper. First of all, the numbers are grossly inflated (inqusition and witch hunts killed far less people than shouted about in the popular media - research it yourself) and secondly, and most importantly, I am coming to the conclusion that these measures were absolutey justified! Read stuff like the "witch hammer" yourself - lots of the practices attributed to the occultists there is exactly the stuff you see with the illuminati-related shit: Weird sex acts to summon unclean spirits, devils doing shit to people (summoned by those witches) that is suspiciously similar those alien abduction stories (those things are probably not outer space aliens) and so on.</p>
<p>Look around what the world looked like in other places during those times: South American natives were occult abusers on an industrial scale (Aztecs, Mayans), China and India were BIG into spirit channeling and stuff (research the concept of what an avatar is for example).</p>
<p>The church did a great job keeping the spiritual peace and those occultists supressed in its sphere of influence. That's why they hate it SO MUCH. Who knows - if the church would have been lenient with them back in the days, maybe we would be already living today in some weirdo illuminati realm with actual demons running around in the open.</p>
<p>I am sure of it that the church is infiltrated in some part too, but out of all the organizations out there, it's the best ally in this spiritual warfare given the track record.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think Pope Francis is a globalist puppet. There is something very fake and sinister about him. </p></p>

        <p><p>"let's just legalize pedophilia already c'mon guys it's not that bad!"</p>
<p>That was not what I said at all. Click on the link. Never said "it's not bad" you troll.</p>
<p>I asked in that thread what actually stops the higher-ups making pedophilia legal if they love it so much (given that they are behind the media and political power). That's a good question actually. They did this with all other sexual deviances too after all.</p>
<p>There was actually a push in Germany to do just that (green party in the 80s).</p>
<p>I am just trying to research this from all angles. Like, why the extreme hostility to the catholic church by the illu-types (watch the lady gaga shit). And why don't these people do the usual "it's just yet another sexual preference!"-thing on the pedo stuff by now given their power etc.</p></p>

        <p><p>Lol you think the Catholic Church isn't implicated?! They institutionalized pedophelia, there is even a great movie that came out about it called Spotlight. Fuck the Catholic Church.</p></p>
