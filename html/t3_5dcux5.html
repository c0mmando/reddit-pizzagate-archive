<p>We need help. We need their resources. We need to benefit from their experience doing these kinds of investigations. </p></p>

        <p><p>You were immediately downvoted, but I think this is a good idea. They can help us, and we can help them. Their insights and experiences could help us understand what we're dealing with, and hopefully keep our research more focused (as opposed to the witch hunt that sometimes occurs here). If they're activists, it means they want open dialog and exposure, and we could use our platform to give them a voice.</p></p>

        <p><p>They would also know what to look for.  We have things like the symbols and stuff, but they would recognize keys words and patterns.  Or they might have resources we don't.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm going to contact someone who I know (not personally) who has done work on human trafficking, specifically sext trade. This organization is Exodus Cry. See Nefarious: Merchant of Souls - http://nefariousdocumentary.com</p>
<p>I will also get in contact with International Justice Mission. </p>
<p>Both are Christian groups that I have great respect for. </p>
<p>Edit: I've emailed them. If I don't hear back in a couple days I'll start calling. Will update. </p>
<p>Edit: Exodus Cry told me to contact the FBI. </p></p>
