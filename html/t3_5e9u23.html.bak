        <strong>Interesting update on the Polish article about #pizzagate - pedos are pasting comments translated with Google Translate</strong>
        <p><p>The article http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,1356,title,Pizzagate-Dziwaczna-teoria-spisku-wymyka-sie-spod-kontroli,wid,18601953,martykul.html tried to label Reddit as "known conspiracy theory site" and the #pizzagate as bullshit generally. </p>
<p>Few interesting things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Article was shared 1500 times on Polish Digg (that's a lot, the country is 8 times smaller than the US)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comments below (http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,1356,title,Pizzagate-Dziwaczna-teoria-spisku-wymyka-sie-spod-kontroli,wid,18601953,mopinie.html) ridiculed  the article and the journalist. The comments show that people know what's going on. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some comments contain typical troll responses "you're stupid" and or "delete this". <strong>Thing is, they are grammatically incorrect, suggesting the use of Google Translate.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: ~uhftu7655tf
Bredzisz. Skasuj zaraz <strong>tego</strong> wpis.</p>
<p>For you linguists: dative used in place of    accusative.</p>
<p>In other words, looks like either pedos are fighting you on their own, or the agency that's fighting you doesn't have enough cash to hire a foreign agent. Mind you, it isn't hard to find a Polish speaker in the US.</p></p>

        <p><p>For me it really looks like the work of a bunch of amateurs. The russkies last year were a class better. </p></p>
