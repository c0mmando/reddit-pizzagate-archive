        <strong>Red Cross spent $500 million of Haiti Earthquake donations to build only 6 houses, with no explanation. Worth investigating?</strong>

        <p><p>The reason why Pizza-Gate is getting so much attention in Turkey is because Turks went through a similar child abduction scandal in the '90s. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5d8yjy/guys_its_happening_turkey_and_other_countries_are/da2wykv/?st=ivo7gfd4&amp;sh=6469981b">This comment explains it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turkish people might have experienced the child abductions first hand when the Gölcük earthquake hit in 1999. There were multiple reports of children not being seen again after being led to ambulances that had no license on them. Burkha wearing women were reported to claim some kids to be "orphaned" and lead them away. There are survivors claiming that their children were rescued from the collapsed buildings, but were not seen ever again.</p>
<p>These anecdotes become a little bit relevant in our context when we find out Bill Clinton visited Turkey after the disaster, visiting survivor camps. Dig out who he traveled to Turkey with, and we may find a connection there.</p>

        <p><p>Just to play the skeptic, a disaster would be an event that any opportunist would use take advantage of to grab kids. There are plenty more people out there doing the same thing. Clinton could potentially have been there for legitimate diplomatic or charitable reasons. </p>
<p>Doesn't mean they're innocent, just that there are other possible explanations for missing children.</p></p>

<hr>
<p>Undercover Government Intelligence Agency Stratfor's conversation straight after Haiti Earthquake, talking about a client in Haiti looking to buy Red Cross' "supplies" to ditribute privately.</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/17/1750750_re-red-cross-.html</p>
<p>"Thanks. A client is looking at whether they can get some of those supplies
or possibly buy some of those supplies for specific people and groups in
Port-au-Prince. They have the ability to pick them up and distribute on
their own in the city."</p>
<p>This probably actually means supplies, like syringes or something. I find it hard to believe that these people would actually talk of kidnapping right after an earthquake, after looking at their other seemingly normal conversations. The vagueness in the wording of "supplies" is weirding me out. </p>
<p>BUT I HAVE A DIFFERENT QUESTION....</p>
<p>1) What is the purpose of this agency?</p>
<p>2) If they are an undercover intelligence agency, that sells information to corporations/governments, what exactly were they selling/studying? I can't seem to determine it through the emails. </p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>"lol, I think the Red Cross also sell supplies to victims..I think. Anyway,
this is a company with $$ so any contacts you may have that can tell them
how to get supplies directly in the city without chartering in a plane is
helpful. That would be step #2."</p>
<p>Did he just say that Red Cross is selling whatever "supplies" these are to the earthquake victims? This can't be normal.</p></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I think that's probably exactly what they were talking about. It's literally the perfect crime. </p>
<p>Enter a natural disaster torn country right after the disaster, find thousands of kids with no homes, load them up and take them off to the market. It's the perfect crime for these organizations. No one would ever suspect it and they have a laundry list of alibis should anyone ever think something weird is up.</p>
<p>Obviously this is just my opinion but it makes perfect sense to me</p></p>

        <p><p>It actually does to me too. The fact that they don't specify what these "supplies" are probably prove it. Maybe I'm still in the denial stage. You think this is worthy of a new thread?</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, I do. I'm coming to suspect every government agency that's been placed in charge of children at this point. They have the easiest access and the best alibis with nothing to lose and everything to gain.</p></p>

        <p><p>Wasn't there something in the Spirit Cooking "recipes" about "Earthquake Nights"? </p>
<p>I wonder what other large earthquakes/natural disasters could be linked to these "aid" operations. </p>
<p>Ie: have there been a spike in child abduction reports following other major natural disasters where specific aid organizations are involved?</p>
<p>True Detective's plot is sounding awfully familiar... i don't want to believe.</p></p>

        <p><p>The common thread that ignited my interest in pizzagate was the fact that all the countries the Clinton Foundation goes to are countries that don't require birth certificates and countries that have just been decimated. Haiti, Somalia, places like that.. places that the average person can't even point to on a map because they think about those countries so little. </p>
<p>It's not a coincidence.</p></p>

        <p><p>I had a bud who was in the Korean war.  Red Cross did fundraisers in the military (when I was in) at the base where we worked.  During Korea, he was cold, hungry, tired, they were selling coffee and donuts at incredible prices.  He was not a man known to anger, but he would rant every time TRC was mentioned.  </p></p>

        <p><p>New suscriber here from France. There was a report few months ago stating that at least 10,000 syrian refugee children have disappeared without leaving a trace once entering the EU. Europol fears they got kidnapped by criminal groups for sex trafficking or other unclear purposes. </p>
<p>Interesting fact, half of those children disappeared in the only Italy. </p>
<p>You can learn more with key words: "10000 syrian children disappeared" on google.</p></p>

        <p><p>Many of those children are found in Italy with essentially nothing besides some form of ID and a ticket to Germany -- which seems to have the most lax laws in regards to refugee status in all of Europe. Statistically, it has the some of the lowest rates for human trafficking/sex slavery because of its legalized prostitution laws, BUT the Germany authorities have made note that the country also happens to be the center for human trafficking in all of Europe. Most traffickers aren't convicted and if they are, they generally got off without much consequence; it wasn't until recently they created a mandatory minimum sentence: something like 6 months to 10 years.</p>
<p>This is alarming to me because who's been funneling tons of cash into Germany, Angela Merkel, and the Merkel Plan?</p>
<p>Soros and the Open Society Foundation.</p></p>

        <p><p>Another Podesta-related agency working in Haiti is the EKTA Foundation, owned by Amrita and Ashok Mahbubani, the Indian couple from Alabama who cooked an elaborate Indian dinner at Tony Podesta's house in D.C. which required the use of a pizza oven.</p>
<p>EKTA has operations in Haiti: http://www.ektafoundationusa.org/main/</p>
<p>"In their path to the present, the Mahbubanis developed a bond with Haiti, through a family owned manufacturing business that employed 300 people there in the '80s. In this, the poorest country in our hemispehere, the EKTA Foundations has made measurable impact working with stellar partners - the Haitian Education &amp; Leadership Program (HELP), Inveneo and Water.org - to change ground realities for the better. Perhaps more fulfilling is the experience of seeing Haitians at all levels strive to take charge of their destiny, directing their irrepressible spirit to rebuild their country as they find their new place in the world."</p></p>

<p>Not trying to promote my own thread at all or anything like that, just lots of information I have been updating there on things I have found regarding their involvement in Haiti. It is disgusting. Also look at "thehaitianblogger" she is very outspoken about their corruption. </p>
<p>I think Haiti has become this huge money laundering scheme for the elite, they want that nation to stay impoverished so they can continue to post these donation links and rake in the money (and children)</p></p>

        <p><p>Worth investigating? NPR along with ProPublica did a great piece on this some time ago.  Neither of these organizations (NPR and ProPublica) are free from scrutiny, but I have to say that these reports are comprehensive and fascinating and seem to have integrity.</p>
<p>Here are their reports.  </p>
<p>http://www.npr.org/series/377506201/special-report-on-the-american-red-cross</p>
<p>How this fits into the bigger picture is yet to be seen, although there is some valid concerns that this ties into a bigger narrative.</p>
<p>Edit:  Does anyone know if the congressional inquiry to this matter ever yielded any results or if it was quashed?</p></p>

        <p><p>From WaPo</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Red Cross says it has provided homes to more than 130,000 people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The biggest materials provisions from international NGOs were in the form of Tin and Tarps. To the tune of many, many millions of dollars. Not kidding here. Once many were given tin and tarps, they were considered "housed". And as you have seen by way of recent hurricane aftermath footage, many still living within tin and tarps.</p>
<p>Found this several weeks back while trying to research WJC LLC. Yes, it's Bill's corporation registered in Delaware, There are a bunch of shell companies too. One is a Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. The fund collected millions. Somehow the fund found it fitting to donate $2M towards construction of a luxury hotel located miles away from the earthquake zone.</p>
<p>See this link - it's one of those obscure but valid stories packed full of info. http://ualr.edu/socialchange/2012/02/26/haiti-where-is-the-money/</p>
<p>And if you really want an eyeful, just google </p>
<p><strong>Haiti Where Is The Money</strong></p>
<p>There is an article towards the top of search results specifically about Red Cross from Chicago Tribune.</p>
<p>I wish I could dig deeper into WJC LLC. Maybe over the winter. That is one huge abyss that has been mostly ignored by everyone --- media, bloggers, general public. I just about guarantee that it ties to Teneo and to Clinton Foundation.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes but much of the original tin and tarps got destroyed during the quake. And more tin and tarps needed for additional people who got displaced. Like if they were lucky enough to live in apartments or even small crappy houses.</p></p>

        <p><p>I mean... the Red Cross <em>may</em> have some hand in child exploitation/trafficking, but I think more than anything it is just a terribly run charity.  If this investigation has showed me anything it is how seedy these nonprofits appear.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think a criminal organization took them for a ride, stole the money, and used it for child trafficking.  </p>
<p>Think about it this way:  stealing from the Red Cross would allow this group to stay completely off the grid, because of The Red Cross' sterling reputation for helping the poor, sick and wounded (according to THEM, not me).  Congress and the senate wouldn't be likely to go down a rabbit hole trying to investigate where the money went, because if they did they could be seen as "Anti-Red Cross" or "Anti-Developing Nation" "Anti-Wounded", "Anti-Sick" or "Anti-Poor".  </p></p>

        <p><p>Great work my friend!  </p>
<p>Notice how the Red Cross tries to sweep it under the rug, with no rational explanation.  </p>
<p>"The report hones in on a major blunder that hindered the charity’s work in Haiti and led to mismanaged funds early on: “An overreliance on foreigners who could not speak French or Creole.”</p>
<p>ProPublica reported that, despite an effort to hire locals, FEW HATIANS HAVE REACHED LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN THE RED CROSS, hampering projects and costing the organization more money."</p>
<p>This to me reads:  Some outside organization stole our money right out from under us, and we have nothing to say to defend ourselves.  That organization was likely some giant international human trafficking ring.  </p></p>

        <p><p>The Red Cross background, money raising after disasters vs. what is dispersed, and over collection of blood is another deep rabbit hole. Maybe/maybe not related, but I'm pretty sure I read that Al Gore was caught with a suite case full of blood at an airport a few years ago. </p></p>
