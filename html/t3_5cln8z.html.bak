        <p><p>If you can cross reference clintons pictures with amber alert children then you may be on to something. Otherwise just a theory. </p></p>

        <p><p>They created AmberAlert and the woman that got caught in Haiti was a part of it wasn't she? or is Alert Sense something different? Even if they don't have ties to Clinton, if they have side pizza businesses or something like that it would be worth looking into.</p></p>
