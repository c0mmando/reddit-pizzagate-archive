        <strong>Spread awareness locally, expose these monsters</strong>
        <p><p>We need to keep pushing this on the ground. Leave flyers of infographs/summaries on cars like people did for #spiritcooking, tag buildings, cover your university with flyers, they're trying to censor this but they don't control everything. </p></p>

        <p><p>They just deleted two others but had a few comments from some ladies who were very shocked and upset. I think this is a great direction to take in spreading awareness as well as other parenting blogs. </p></p>
