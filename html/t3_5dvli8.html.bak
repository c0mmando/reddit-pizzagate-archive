        <strong>What happened in the comments section of this highly upvoted thread?</strong>
        <p><p>https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dpalh/spread_this_like_wildfire_this_meme_is_100_fact/</p>
<p>Almost all the highest upvoted comments in the thread are either:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>name-calling/ad hominem attacks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sarcastic comments intended to make us seem crazy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>black/white thinking ie. "this is complete bullshit"; no level-headed comments like "well I agree with X but Y doesn't make sense"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people trying to discredit Pizzagate entirely because of a misleading title on a thread that isn't really even the integral part of the investigation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So what's going on here? CTR in full force? Or are the people of /r/all really that illogical to think an entire theory is a complete joke because of one thread?</p></p>

        <p><p>You must understand that CTR is directly connected to the cult via David Brock, ex-boyfriend of Jimmy Comet.</p>
<p>Once you realize this, you understand that CTR is actually not college students looking to make a buck, but most likely people in the cult.</p>
<p>This secret satanic pedophile cannibal cult has more than likely existed for thousands of years.</p>
<p>They have an army of people at their disposal. </p>
<p>So yes, most if not all of the comments refusing this to be truth are probably paid in baby's buttholes and free pizza to sew distrust in the mix.</p></p>

        <p><p>"In a previous chapter I have hinted at something of the psychology that lies behind a certain type of religion. There was a tendency in those hungry for practical results, apart from poetical results, to call upon spirits of terror and
compulsion; to move Acheron in despair of bending the Gods. There is always a sort of dim idea that these darker powers will really do things, with no nonsense about it. In the interior psychology of the Punic peoples this strange
sort of pessimistic practicality had grown to great proportions. In the New Town, which the Romans called Carthage, as in the parent cities of Phoenicia,
the god who got things done bore the name of Moloch, who was perhaps identical with the other deity whom we know as Baal, the Lord. The Romans did not at first quite know what to call him or what to make of him; they had to
go back to the grossest myth of Greek or Roman origins and compare him to Saturn devouring his children. But the worshippers of Moloch were not gross
or primitive. They were members of a mature and polished civilisation, abounding in refinements and luxuries; they were probably far more civilised
than the Romans. And Moloch was not a myth; or at any rate his meal was not a myth. These highly civilised people really met together to invoke the blessing of heaven on their empire by throwing hundreds of their infants into a large furnace. We can only realise the combination by imagining a number of Manchester merchants with chimney-pot hats and mutton-chop whiskers, going to church every Sunday at eleven o'clock to see a baby roasted alive".</p>

        <p><p>Yeah CTR is here, and have been since the beginning.  They push a lot of the way-out-there nonsense.  They claim the pizza code in the Podesta emails is innocent.  They question clear links and evidence.  They are monsters covering up for even bigger monsters.</p></p>

        <p><p>The most insidious of them are the concern  trolls.  The usually start like this:</p>
<p>" I think you guys are doing good stuff but... I'm having trouble believing xyz.
Then you give them evidence and they continue to deny or change subject.  They cherry pick without addressing other big issues.  They try to fake being reasonable.  Call them out and down vote.</p></p>

        <p><p>Podesta was gaining info on Portugese politics via subscription. https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/41384</p>
<p>So thats what the CIA Stratfor was calling the "whole ball of wax" in the Global intelligence Files. They were possibly selling subscriptions to updates on politics around the world.</p>

        <p><p>Personally, what i was trying when i still answered to threads like that. Was building some kind of "format" we could use to make this all seem less bullshit for first time visitors.</p>
<p>At this point it mostly looks like a paranoid whichhunt with people full of shit finding wrong leads and mixing them up with real information. Then adding bullshit about satanism and how every single media company is involved into all this.</p>
<p>At this point all hope for this sub is lost. I dont see how this could go back to be some kind of information source for anything other than researchers who are already involved anyway.</p>
<p>Edit:// Yes people at /r/all very well could get that impression. Thats my point. People who will visit the sub without prior knowledge will be confronted with so much obvious bullshit and clickbait titles that they can only come to the conclusion that we are all just a bunch of crazy conspiracy folks.</p>
<p>Edit2:// Like even the top voted comment in this thread calls it "secret satanic pedophile cannibal cult" when all we really know and can proof is "secret pedophile cult". See how this makes a really bad impression already?</p></p>

        <p><p>Police sketches are conclusive, they exactly show podesta brothers. 
I thought everyone agreed on this.</p>
<p>If anyone in doubt reads the material(I read) they even say they suspected an international ring of pedos.</p></p>

        <p><p>The e-fits look exactly like the Podesta brothers (hauntingly similar--it's burned into my brain), but people are saying that those e-fits were created based on witness descriptions of what just one suspect looked like.</p>
<p>At least that's what I've read. Hard to wade through it all when you know it's highly likely that disinformation agents are in here.</p></p>
