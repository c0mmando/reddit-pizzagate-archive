        <strong>Further investigation to the Children of Brainbow/brainbro song by the Apes.</strong>
        <p><p>I know I have made a few threads about this now about this song. But yesterday I decided to look up what brainbow actually is, and it is a scientific method that is related to using proteins to light up different parts of the brain and see how it operates. That's all fine and dandy, but then on the wiki I stumbled across this: </p>
<p>'' As with any neuroimaging technique, Brainbow has a number of limitations that stem from the methods required to perform it. For example, the process of breeding at least two strains of transgenic animals from embryonic stem cells is both time consuming and complex. Even if two transgenic species are successfully created, not all of their offspring will show the recombination. Thus, this requires extensive planning prior to performing an experiment.[3]'' </p>
<p>Which lead me to look up what transgenic animals are, which is the following: </p>
<p>''Transgenic animals are animals (most commonly mice) that have had a foreign gene deliberately inserted into their genome. Such animals are most commonly created by the micro-injection of DNA into the pronuclei of a fertilised egg which is subsequently implanted into the oviduct of a pseudopregnant surrogate mother. This results in the recipient animal giving birth to genetically modified offspring. The progeny are then bred with other transgenic offspring to establish a transgenic line. Transgenic animals can also be created by inserting DNA into embryonic stem cells which are then micro-injected into an embryo which has developed for five or six days after fertilisation, or infecting an embryo with viruses that carry a DNA of interest. This final method is commonly used to manipulate a single gene, in most cases this involves removing or 'knocking out' a target gene. The end result is what is known as a ‘knockout’ animal.''</p>
<p>I do find it peculiar how this band would put such a scientific process that involves injecting embryo's with a foreign gene, and then go on to link it with children. These animals are also often injected with diseases to study them, which links to the song lyrics, which can be found in my previous thread. </p>

<p>Tinfoil hat kind of thought here.. But could it be that next to organ harvesting and sexual activities, they're using these children for scientific purposes as well? The lines:'They're building robot bodies to spread disease', could maybe relate to conducting scientific experiments on these children, and perhaps even creating children with foreign genomes? I don't know but its all quite weird to me. Why would you write such a song in relation to rich lonely men and children?</p>
<p>Also, when I googled brainbow children, I would actually land onto a website focused on helping children with brain tumors. Involved as well perhaps? </p>

<p>I know this is probably a very tinfoil hat kind of comment, but I wanted to post in nonetheless</p></p>

        <p><p>Not familiar with the apes but I wanted to give a thought on 'They're building robot bodies to spread disease' &gt; intense abuse can/will give you an out of body experience, what is seen as separating of soul from body, depending on the way this is achieved this can turn into an continuous detachment of self thus becoming a "mr. robot" ....</p></p>
