        <strong>Starting to look into possible connections between pizzagate and Delaware (joe Biden and friends). I'm not the most computer savvy person and everyone needs a CYA policy so any general advice anyone wants the toss my way would be greatly appreciated. Please and thank you.</strong>

        <p><p>Archives are great leads.  Look into Enron.  Huge corrupt company that was in bed with George Bush.  Also connections to Dyncorp, which was busted for rampant pedophilia...No one really got into any sort of trouble  http://www.dunwalke.com/sidebars/dyncorp.htm</p></p>

Leelah Alcorn, who was 17, walked into the path of the tractor-trailer in the wee hours of 28 December. She had left a handwritten note on her bed – “I’ve had enough” – and had done an online search about runaway assistance and a Tumblr search for the word “suicide” before walking on to Interstate 71 in suburban Cincinnati, according to a patrol report released on Wednesday. https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/29/trangender-teenager-leelah-alcorn-ohio-suicide

        <p><p>David Brock had a house in rehoboth beach/henlopen acres. Apparently held what was a described as a "gay Democrat gala" there before his ex made him sell it to pay him off. Brock is now with Mr. Comet Ping Pong James Alefantis. </p>
<p>CAMP rehoboth - Brock's ex was pretty involved. Interesting org. Local drama and lots of gossip. But it's a small town. </p>
<p>Richards/DuPont - richards is one of the DuPont trustfunders who got caught molesting his own kids. Mommy is a DuPont. Daddy is a big lawyer in Wilmington. Also has home in rehoboth where molesting is reported to have happened. </p>
<p>Rehoboth is a political hotspot in the summer. Tons of politicians and celebrities go there with their families. Also big in rehoboth is an influx of foreign workers. They sometimes go missing in the name of "claiming amnesty". Seen that personally. Was years ago so never thought much of it. Now that I am putting it in this frame, it should have seemed odd they left their money, passports, plane tickets, and belongings. It was more irritating I had to clean up after them. </p>
<p>Beau Biden did a lot of favors in the AG's office. Was supposed to be installed governor after Markell but Beau died. That might also be an interesting angle. Also, Beau just sort of disappeared when he got sick. Lots of rumors about what was happening and then he was dead. Interesting to think of what Biden would have done with his son as governor of a state with major a large shipping port and lots of international traffic. </p></p>

        <p><p>Are you from the area? I live here year round, was thinking about taking a walk by camp Rehoboth. I used to work on Baltimore ave, but never thought much of the place. </p>
<p>This investigation got me thinking about earl Bradley and his fuckery. He was around here for a long time, I'm wondering if maybe he hosted a parties or donated or something. Also, there's a beau Biden foundation for the protection of children. Joe and his wife are the honorary chancellors. There's not much info about what they actually do to defend kids but if you donate on the site it brings you to 'act blue' charities, which is a free fundraising site for anyone who registers their charity as democrat. </p>
<p>Delawares tax laws are so loose you can practically set up a shell company with ease. Lots of ways to funnel and launder money. </p></p>

        <p><p>Grew up there. Lots of family there. You've probably heard my family's names thrown around - we've been there almost 400 years. I live many, many miles away but Delaware will always be where I'm from. </p>
<p>The state is an interesting place. Old families and old money. People focus on NCC but forget Sussex is more interconnected and there's money in them thar fields. </p>
<p>More interesting than Bradley himself is all the doctors who knew what he was doing and didn't do anything. He didn't do so well in Milford - they started reporting him, but nothing happened. Too far away from the beach, I guess. More of the salt of the earth farmer type than social climber atmosphere. </p>
<p>The state is dirty from top to bottom. The political party listed means nothing. There's a book called "only in Delaware" that discusses how politicially inbred the state is. It's worth a read if you can lay hands on it. </p>
<p>A word of caution - don't get too deep locally unless you have a good handle on who you're asking about. Family lines run deep and people are interrelated in ways that might surprise you. I have been surprised to find out how I'm related to someone I had no clue was family. </p></p>
