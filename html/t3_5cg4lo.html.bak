        <strong>YOU are now tasked with doing the job of the MEDIA, FBI, Law Enforcement etc.</strong>
        <p><p>Here are some things you can do to archive evidence;</p>
<p>https://archive.is</p>
<p>https://web.archive.org</p>
<p>Save the webpage directly to your computer;</p>
<p>On either Firefox or Google Chrome select the "Menu button" then "Save Page" and then "Web Page, complete HTML"</p>
<p>No website can be trusted to hold the evidence...you have to back it up and then back it up again.</p>
<p>It would be a waste of energy to send this info to any "ABC" agency as they most likely have their hands tied and are probably apart of this whole thing.</p>
<p>What you can do is inform everyone of your friends and family about this even sending them a link anonymously with all relevant information.</p>
<p>If people call for "hangings" then we are no better than THEY are and we haven't leaned anything.  Nature will take its course.</p></p>

        <p><p>Is the FBI corrupt as well? I imagine they're ripping their hair out over this</p></p>

        <p><p>We don't know what proportion of it is or is not corrupt. They are fighting sex trafficking and prostitution rings nationwide and that effort will be expanding to some foreign countries next year.</p>
<p>That effort NEVER gets any media coverage. If you want to read about it look up: Operation Cross Country</p>
<p>It's been conducted 10 times. The most recent bust was last month. The bust in 2013 included a cell in Alexandria, VA.</p></p>

        <p><p>The FBI and DOJ are absolutely corrupt and complicit to criminal corruption, primarily at the top level, but it goes much further than two dysfunctional agencies. That is not just a hypothesis. This is based on experience, and there is little to no faith that Trump will actually "drain the swamp", but rather be consumed by the swamp himself. He is a false victory. </p>
<p>This person's thread is correct. We are all charged with the task of saving the world through the truth, and either need to force the FBI and DOJ to do their job or do it for them. Anyone dismissing the criminal corruption is part of the ring. Make no mistake, there are many more than you know, and this is deeper than anyone can imagine. </p></p>
