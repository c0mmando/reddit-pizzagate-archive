        <strong>Walnut Sauce emails explained</strong>
        <p><p>So a lot of people think Walnut Sauce is a code word, because of the "sinister" undertones the narrative has. So I did some digging to look at things from a less conspiracy perspective . (which likely means downvotes but fuck it)</p>
<p>http://imgur.com/a/8a9cq</p>
<p>John Podesta is clearly into cooking / food a lot. Just keep that in mind when reading emails about cooking / food.</p>
<p>For instance, https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30277</p>
<p>A lot of people have jumped on these emails</p>
<p>"Hey John,</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We know you're a true master of cuisine and we have appreciated that for years ... "</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>People have took this as a code for, John being a pedo ring master. A more likely explanation is, he likes  to cook.</p>

<p>"But walnut sauce for the pasta? Mary, plz tell us the straight story, was the sauce actually very tasty?"</p>
<p>What this means: Walnut sauce with pasta seems unconventional to some. But despite that, Jim Steyer is asking if it worked. Walnut sauce and pasta is an actual dish.</p>
<p>http://fromthegardentable.com/pasta-with-toasted-walnut-spinach-sauce/</p>
<p>Same dish as John Podestas walnut sauce = https://twitter.com/jmpalmieri/status/621136472326963202</p>
<p>And thus, concluding, Walnut sauce = Walnut sauce.
Again, please do not downvote simply because it goes against the  current theory. This does not discredit the entire idea, but I believe it clears up the walnut sauce emails.</p></p>

        <p><p>Whether the terminology is literal or coded, this is a data point. A piece of the puzzle. </p>
<p>Any one suggesting "nothing to see here", "case closed" or "it clears up the walnut sauce emails" isn't investigating impartially. </p></p>

        <p><p>I disagree.</p>
<p>Anyone dismissing or trying to bury a very plausible alternative explanation (which is what is happening on this sub right now) isn't investigating impartially.</p>
<p>I'm the ONLY person here who has even attempted to step aside and examine the evidence from a different perspective. People just arent interested because they want it to be true.</p></p>

<p>Can be explained by this email (which, coincidentally is the email about kids in the pool):</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/47943</p>
<p>"I recall chatting with fellow Dupuytren's sufferer John Podesta out at

<p>Not true. Not everyone is on a witchhunt and not everyone here wants this to be true. I too believe the walnut sauce is explainable. After researching it is an actual ethnic dish. Most of the pasta emails seem normal too. BUT I haven't heard the handkerchief email explained at all.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>One comment of yours:</p>
<p>/u/nobstruthseeker says </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You're right. He does cook. And maybe he does make walnut sauce. But does it explain the handkerchief with a map that is pizza-related? </p>

<p><em>To which you replied:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[â€“]TwoPipes[S] 2 points 55 minutes ago 
one thing at a time. This thread is about the walnut sauce.</p>

<p>--</p>
<p>2nd comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, pizza.jpg has an explanation, Walnut Sauce has an explanation, the handkerchief has an explanation </p>
</blockquote>
<p>--</p>
<p>How is the handkerchief logically explained? </p></p>

        <p><p>That is correct. He is a huge foodie and enjoys cooking elaborate dinners. </p>
<p>I recognized this early on, and it is what makes the excitement over "pizza" even more suspect. </p></p>

        <p><p>Unless he's a food enthusiast to cover the trail of food related code that he's going to be using in his pedo pursuits. </p>
<p>Ever seen The Prestige? </p>
<p>The Chinese magician fakes being old and feeble to do a gold fish bowl magic trick. Don't be the magician who couldn't figure it out. Don't be Hugh Jackman, be Christian Bale. Be Batman, not an X-man.</p></p>

        <p><p>Aight, now to explain this email.</p>
<p>It's Christmas. Look at the dates, and ending the email with Merry Christmas.</p>
<p>He is thanking the person for his Christmas gift, which was not what he expected. The present was a box of cheeses...actual cheeses.</p>
<p>He then says he will wait for his kids to get home before eating the cheese. Demolishing the cheeses, not his children. They like cheese, that's why a friend got him a box of assorted cheese.</p>
<p>You know when you have that moment when it all clicks, but no one else seems to understand? They call it red pilling. That's how I feel now that I've discovered the actual truth of all this.</p></p>

        <p><p>This logic is the exact logic podesta wanted when coding his emails.
If I make it seem like I'm a foodie, nobody will suspect a thing when I talk about pizza and walnut sauce.
However, you COULD be right.
But so COULD we.
If he was going to use a code, he would make sure he was a step ahead of anyone outside of his ring reading such emails.
Therefore this is not debunked. But rather we have 2 meanings for this email. As we did before.
Podesta loves food
Or he loves children
The nation and the subreddit decide the meaning, not you.</p></p>

        <p><p>What reason is there to think it's a code? Realistically. 
Without reading the emails with the predetermined mindset it's a code, what reason is there to think it is?</p>
<p>It's a loop.
It's a code because he's a pedo.
He's a pedo so he uses a code.</p>
<p>If I come in and say "it's not a code, it's a handkerchief", the loop is broken. There is no reason to suspect he is using a code, which is what planted the idea he is a pedo to begin with.</p>
<p>So, pizza.jpg has an explanation, Walnut Sauce has an explanation, the handkerchief has an explanation. All logical explanations. Are they perfect? No, but neither are the theories.</p>
<p>Put them all together, it paints a picture. And thus, I now believe Pizzagate to be witch hunting innocent people.</p></p>

        <p><p>The reasons I posted here.</p>
<p>He cooks, there's literal photo evidence of him cooking a walnut sauce with pasta. 
There are numerous recipes involving walnut sauce with pasta on the internet that look identical to his.</p>
<p>Photo evidence of him cooking with walnut sauce is my reason.</p></p>

        <p><p>You're right. He does cook. And maybe he does make walnut sauce. But does it explain the handkerchief with a map that is pizza-related? Or is it just coincidence that his brother, his regular hangout place, Comet Ping Pong and its owner just so have so many pictures on children that are disturbing? If I were him, I would use a code word that blends in my hobbies and can be easily dismissed with pictures like this. It's good to have a seemingly unbiased perspective, but look at this as a whole, and don't discourage or throw off the pizzagate investigation efforts. </p></p>

        <p><p>one thing at a time.
This thread is about the walnut sauce.</p>
<p>I see it come up a lot, throwing in my two cents.
If anything it helps, keeps people on the right tracks and ignoring dead ends.</p></p>

        <p><p>Simple stuff.</p>
<p>Jim doesn't know what's hes talking about because he is questioning if Walnut Sauce and pasta even go together.</p>
<p>"But walnut sauce for the pasta? Mary, plz tell us the straight story, was the sauce actually very tasty?"</p>
<p>He is doubting the dish, John responds with</p>
<p>"It's an amazing Ligurian dish made with crushed walnuts made into a paste. So stop being so California."</p>
<p>aka, he's insulting him in a jokingly way. "Stop being so California and try something new"</p>
<p>In which the final response is  ""Haha Jim has no idea what he's talking about" (Jim was the one saying the walnut sauce and pasta dish is weird)</p></p>
