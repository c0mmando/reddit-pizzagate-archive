        <strong>We have a ton of evidence and we just don't know it. So many abuse survivors have spoken, hollywood, global elite, and otherwise, that we never believed before. There have to be connections between hollywood/government.</strong>
        <p><p>I've been reading a lot of stuff from abuse survivors. People we would have most likely dismissed prior to this.  They seem to be saying exactly what the connections we are uncovering are saying.  I think a ton of info can be gained from using this approach and working backwards</p>
<p>I was looking through paintings by Kim noble who is apparently an abuse survivor, a lot of her paintings are very disturbing</p>

<p>One of Kim Nobles paintings reminded me a bit of the ping pong tables and what they might refer to as ping pong

<p>Oddly, matches Brad Pitt in mr and Mrs Smith:

<p>Maybe she just watched the movie. Who knows.   But I feel like there are a lot of stories out there of people explaining what happened to them, and maybe they are a lot more credible than we previously assumed</p></p>

        <p><p>Symbology is a stronger language than written words for many. Symbols pre-date the written works and the roots are strong. This lives on.</p>
<p>Many people here I recommend to study wiccan symbols. I think the up/down triangles are fire and water signs and pointing together show the female (butterfly). This represents fertility. </p></p>
