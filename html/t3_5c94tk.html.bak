        <strong>Shadowbanned from /r/conspiracy: Bill Maher, Dan Schneider, Corey Haim, other rumors</strong>
        <p><p>I'm not sure if this is a Pizzagate connection or just a coincidence with a rational explanation. Bill Maher is one of the left's biggest supporters. He's been a board member of PETA since 1997 and an advisory board member of Project Reason. His production company is named Kid Love Productions. http://www.imdb.com/company/co0093906/ It might just be related to the rapper Kid.</p>
<p>Also, has anyone brought up Nickelodeon producer Dan Schneider and any of the rumors that surround him? He created All That, The Amanda Show, Drake &amp; Josh, Zoey 101, iCarly, Victorious, Sam &amp; Cat, Henry Danger, and Game Shakers. There are tons of rumors about him. That he knocked up Britney Spears's younger sister. Also the rumor that he knocked up Amanda Bynes and paid for her abortion. Also the stuff about him having a foot fetish and girl's feet being prominent in his shows. He could be an unrelated pedophile and not part of the ring but maybe the smart guys can look for connections.</p>
<p>There are also the rumors stemming from Corey Haim featured in the show Two Coreys about a Hollywood pedophile ring.</p>
<p>Another rumor is about Hollywood directors or producers sharing casting couch recordings amongst themselves using a secret server, I think I remember it being Bryan Singer. And check out this mentioning underage boys http://time.com/88234/bryan-singer-hollywood-scandal/</p>
<p>Also another rumor surrounding the book "Room 23" and it's author. Apparently the author has a mysterious past that doesnt really explain her wealth and some researchers / crazy people believe she is a pimp and this book is advertising different hollywood stars for high priced sex with Saudi princes. http://www.room23thebook.com</p>
<p>Another rumor, Zsa Zsa Gabor was kept as a slave by Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt for a number of years. http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/11/showbiz/gabor-conservatorship/ Prince Frederic von Anhal is also connected with the Anna Nicole Smith case https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntj9DYeRXvM, specifically fighting in court for Anna Nicole's daughter Dannielynn. Another rumor about him is that he is related to Hitler. Just telling you what I've heard, don't shoot the messenger.</p>
<p>Feel free to dismiss anything I said which is without merit, I'm just telling you the rumors I know about. The Bill Maher one isnt even a rumor, just something I noticed.</p></p>

        <p><p>Bill Maher's been acting like a lunatic in recent days, I'm sure he's a big part of it all. I have a feeling this thing is much bigger and involves way more people than we could ever imagine. I read somewhere the guess of 70,000 in this satanic pedophile cult, wouldn't be that hard for them to take over all aspects of government, entertainment, education, and news with such a large group.</p></p>

        <p><p>Before I was red pilled I watched Maher.  Not because I agreed with everything, but he seemed to at least have a handle on things in order to present his argument.  I flicked him on during the elections and he was going on and on about how the email leaks are fake and from Russia etc etc.  It's this sort of intellectual dishonesty, far removed from what we know to be true, that makes me think there is something more sinister than just politics at play.  These people are throwing their integrity out the window.  No hedging of bets, no planning for the next election, just vehemently denying and discrediting these leaks.  There is far more than left/right wing politics at stake for these people </p></p>

        <p><p>Like all of them leading up to the election. The last one he was very off, joking about being drunk (maybe), and stopped the show a couple times because he was in such disbelief.</p></p>

        <p><p>I wish connected people and victims knew they could safely and anonymously disclose information via reddit.  obviously they have to be careful, but like a hotline they can share intel with hopes for justice.  We can connect the dots are only agenda is to save kids and stop the crimes.</p></p>
