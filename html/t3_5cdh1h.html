        <strong>Was Aaron Swartz killed for looking into this pedophilia ring as well?</strong>
        <p><p><a href="http://stateofthenation2012.com/?p=55941">This article</a> suggests that Swartz was killed for uncovering MIT files linking it to this international ring. </p>
<p>It also mentions Jerry Sandusky. Remember, the Centre Countyâ€™s District Attorney, Ray Gricar, disappeared when he reopened his investigation into the case. His body was never found, but his laptop was found in a nearby creek. The FBI said no information could be retrieved. </p>
<p>I think Sandusky is more than likely involved or tied to this, but Swartz is new to me. </p></p>

        <p><p>I found out about this recently.  I think the answer is, Yes most likely.  He wouldn't of broke into a building for documents that could be bought online for a few bucks.  Also text-files can move between drives very fast.  It seems he was downloading video which takes much longer.  It appears an organization called "One Laptop One Child" is involved.  We need to dig into this.  It is all connected.  Good luck everyone.  Stay safe.  Every govt organization in the world is probably involved or knows about what is going on.</p></p>

        <p><p>I too found this VERY suspicious. If you have a university affiliation, such as with MIT, you can easily access the database subscriptions for JSTOR from a library for free. You can use university wifi or vpn on to the university network from the comfort of your own home and download as much JSTOR as you want. It makes no sense that we would break into a secure server room just to download JSTOR articles. Anyone can download JSTOR articles. However, it also seems rather unlikely that cheese pizza or evidence of a cheese pizza delivery network would be stored on MIT servers. Also, let's say that it was on there and that's what Swartz was downloading. How did he know it was there? How did he know where to look to find these pizza related files? Like many of you, I just don't buy the JSTOR story, but we need to retrace Swartz's steps in order to find out what he was doing. Something led him there. You don't just wake up one day and think, "I smell cheese pizza coming from this locked server room at MIT, better go check it out."</p></p>
