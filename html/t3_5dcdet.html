        <strong>Should we download (and backup) this sub?</strong>
        <p><p>I started to get worried that something will happen, even though mods are warned us, and this sub will get a ban hammer. We won't know the real reason behind this.</p>
<p>To not lose all the information in this sub, you think it would be a good idea to download whole sub?</p>
<p>I never used it but found this at github: http://nicschrading.com/project/reddit-data-extractor/</p>
<p>Would it make sense to get a backup incase, or am I being too paranoid?</p></p>

        <p><p>Keep in mind we already are using a git repo which is backed up frequently (see the Collaboration tools thread). I'm going to add a link to the reddit data extractor to that Thread, thank you so much!</p></p>
