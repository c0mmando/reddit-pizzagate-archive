        <strong>Just remember, innocent until proven guilty, don't harass people involved in this investigation!</strong>
        <p><p>Even with all the evidence stacking up, it's still speculation at this point. Don't harass people, we don't want to ruin any innocent peoples lives. Keep on and keep investigating. Example, all the reviews on google now are 1 star calling them pedophiles. I believe the narrative too, but nothing is certain. Don't be a dick.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is what fucked everything up.  As soon as the comet lead came out everyone started trolling their social media and they deleted everything.  They are lucky to have gotten the pics they did</p></p>

        <p><p>Definitely agree.. There is always the possibility that all this can be explain, and honestly its kind of tragic that innocent hard working people might be getting their jobs and businesses ruined.</p>
<p>I mean I'm not saying if they are or aren't, something is definitely extremely sketcy.. But we can't say anything 100% yet.</p></p>
