        <strong>Looks like r/skeptic is officially compromised, they are eating up NYTimes propaganda.</strong>

        <p><p>It should be r/SkepticalofAnythingThatChallengesMyWorldview</p>
<p>They don't show any skepticism of the sloppy journalism displayed in the article, and they are downvoting the only person who mentioned that it doesn't address any of the evidence that we've compiled here. </p>
<p>I would say that one advantage of this investigation is that it exposes the lengths people will go to to blindly ignore what challenges their viewpoints on reality. It's one thing to refute evidence directly with logic and reasoning, and it's quite another to dismiss something out of hand because it sounds crazy.</p></p>
