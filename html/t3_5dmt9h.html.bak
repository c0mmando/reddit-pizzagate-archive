        <strong>My web browser was likely compromised</strong>
        <p><p>Posting on a throwaway. Will not check this account again. </p>
<p>Just want you guys to know that while browsing the various sites linked my copy of chrome has been compromised. The software is trying to do some unusual things with memory access and crashes my computer. It has never done this before, nothing else behaves like it. This has only started happening within the hour I discovered this sub and the links on the_donald, and I started clicking around. Whether any of all this pizzagate stuff is legitimate, you should be careful, because you might be getting yourselves infected with who knows what.</p>
<p>I'd be careful with Cloudflare (anti-ddos hosting company, that you may seem trying to captcha you while you browse with tor). They offer their services to child pornography websites, and refuse to terminate their protection of them.</p></p>

<p>Not true.  Please report any suspected child sex abuse material to cloudflare.com/abuse</p></p>

        <p><p>Haven't noticed anything here and have been digging pretty heavily lol. I've been running Peerblock and Wireshark to monitor traffic but nothing unusual aside from UK's Ministry of Defense IPs being flagged from Hamachi's use of that range. I suppose I will say since the past 2 weeks or so after a recent W10 update things have been running seemingly slow but eh.</p>
<p>I highlight doubt what was said about Cloudflare, though. Might as well suspect Mega, too. ¯<em>(ツ)</em>/¯ </p></p>

        <p><p>I got fucked with a man in the middle attack the other day. Really screwed my windows laptop up but it's ok because I have a Mac too. 
Anyway I'm nearly certain it happened from clicking a link here. </p></p>

        <p><p>This happened to me too except with safari. It only happened once and hasn't happened again. It has NEVER happened in the past. I had several tabs open then one day the screen froze and the browser crashed, giving me some error related to memory. </p></p>
