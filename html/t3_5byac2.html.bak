        <strong>Rustik Tavern. Also mentioned in the Podesta mails. Here's some of that creepy cartoon art. Anyone want to research it?</strong>

        <p><p>Look chaps, sometimes you have to just realize when something is a pizza. It IS a pizza place at the end of the day. It's a Pizza Christmas tree, the boxes have lines of them to simulate ribbons often seen on gifts.</p>
<p>Now, I'm totally behind this conspiracy. But, when pizza is involved, you have to think "are they actually just talking about pizza?".</p>
<p>Context is important, simply having a pizza image in a pizza place does not mean it's a code word. Now, say, when the emails are like "you left your handkerchief, pizza map etc", that makes NO sense with Pizza in the context.</p>
<p>I just say this because I don't want to see this devolve into "it's a pizza! So, it must be pedo linked!". Probs just a christmas tree pizza in this case</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree. The reasons that I posted it are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The black and white boxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cartoon image looks like the same style of artwork that I saw at the other places. Same artist?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The floating star seemed odd.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cartoon pizza inconsistent with restaurant branding. See their website.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All I'm asking is that someone check out the ownership and see if there is a connection to the people involved.</p></p>

        <p><p>Definitely smacks of the same symbolism.  Notice the white/black (pedo/sadomasochism) on the boxes, which also looks like a (inverted?) cross.  Also the star (pentagram) as also seen in the Comet Ping Pong sign.</p></p>
