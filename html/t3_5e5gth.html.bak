        <strong>Regarding the links between Macaulay Culkin and #PizzaGate.</strong>
        <p><p>Strap on your tinfoil hat as this might be a stretch, but someone posted a link and I was reminded of a post I'd seen a while back.</p>
<p>Vid1: "Here's your very own cheese pizza". Whilst at face value the statement alone doesn't give much food for thought, notice the Grinches face on the TV. Looks devious to say the least.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVKTOO3R0gc</p>
<p>Vid2: Notice the "no fiddlin' around" Yeah quite a stupid statement, again nothing too bold.  But look what's on the door "Back door please"....</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=87&amp;v=GcOsVzSOqoQ</p>
<p>Again kind've nothing but then what in the actual living fuck is this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pizza_Underground  The guy who was the kid in Home Alone now has a fucking band called "The Pizza Underground", after "going off the rails" in recent years.</p>
<p>Now I admit before I post this I have paranoia and probably some mental issues... I also might be trying to force a square block into a round hole... But what if the guy knows the consequences of speaking out, and this is the most he can do without being accidentally suicided?</p>
<p>Speculation at best but quite odd.</p>
<p>Edit1: Okay I'm fucking done.. Look at his fucking bands cover https://i.sli.mg/2JoWBr.png</p>
<p>Edit2: Just Macaulay eating a slice of pizza with a very depressed demeanour about himself. Credit to GoHeadBeGoneWithIt - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pzm1lQX0qU </p></p>

        <p><p>I never thought to make that connection with Pizza Underground, but you could for sure be right. It's a pretty hilarious gimmick actually. They cover velvet underground songs but swap out all the lyrics about doing dope with lyrics about eating pizza.</p></p>

        <p><p>Very good theory. Add it to the potentials list. Also, save everything offline and online multiple places. Archive the heck outta this. Theyre onto us and we need to preserve every shred of evidence </p></p>
