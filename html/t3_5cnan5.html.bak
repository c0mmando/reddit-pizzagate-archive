        <p><p>So I created this account last night when I was drunk to try and help. I don't think my drunken intentions will do any good though. </p>
<p>If you truly want to bring this shit down you need some operation security. If it as bad as they say, the only hope is getting the local police to bust this shit while it's happening. FBI isn't going to do shit. The public collaboration has been finding great stuff, but by the time you force any of these cronies to enforce anything the leads will be cold as... frozen pizza. </p>
<p>You need to bust down into cells with a couple autists and a couple investigators to track down new leads using secure communication.</p>

        <p><p>This is true, up until now I've been going balls deep on these fuckers using clearnet, now I am starting to doubt doing this, but then again I am a shut in who lives in a fortress with attack dogs everywhere. </p></p>
