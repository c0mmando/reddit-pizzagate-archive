        <strong>Any news after the original mail</strong>
        <p><p>Is there actually anything new? I red this original page, which apparently got mirrored at different places now. There is no new information since then, just partial quoting and relinking. And this first page might have a problem with the way it documented the way it found the stuff. So, all we have is the original page, or the infos from that time?! Or am I missing something? Reading through a lot of the recent posts, it feels like this thing is running out of breath.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well there was a surge of information gathering, and sharing, and now -- I am hoping -- people are processing the information, making connections, and drawing verifiable conclusions.  </p></p>

        <p><p>There are a lot of interesting things being posted all over this sub, but we don't really have a way to document them properly so they are rather scattered. </p>
<p>I don't believe we have uncovered anything compelling or drastically new, just more leads to follow.</p>
<p>It's a shame as there is only so much we can do, we cannot arrest, question or investigate, so in a sense we are rather limited and breath will only go so far.</p>
<p>Hopefully a lead will uncover something interesting soon, though, and a new breath of fresh air will hit us. </p></p>

        <p><p>We just aren't likely to find anything that isn't circumstantial.  I think we have established plenty of probable cause for a search warrant, but would the DC police actually do anything?</p></p>

        <p><p>I think this is an underlying issue with the communication format of Reddit itself. The layout of a sub is not all that useful for collective research in the first place.</p></p>
