        <strong>Does anyone remember Dr. Gosnell, abortionist convicted of illegal late-term abortions? Any relation here at Gosnell's Pizza?</strong>

        <p><p>Doubtful. The location of Gosnell's Pizza (closed in 2013) is about four hours from Kermit Gosnell's former clinic. If you have read up on the case against him, you will find that his acts were audacious... and maybe lazy. Why would he transport "goods" (good god I can't believe I'm even entertaining this idea) so far away? The man was a half-step from a full-blown hoarder. Gosnell doesn't seem to be that uncommon of a name.</p></p>

        <p><p>let's not forget that Pelosi had a pizza place registered in Panama. Distance is a boon to cover crimes, not a liability </p></p>

        <p><p>Good point. Nancy Pelosi's place was called Goat Hill, I believe... not Pelosi's Pizza. Someone masking illegal activity might use a different name if they're smart (but I realize that Dr. Gosnell might not have been the smartest...). I just think it's bad form to start questioning every single pizza place instead of researching source material and working outward from there. </p></p>

        <p><p>also bad form to ignore potential leads. the fact that this place is in PA puts it very close to DC. using his name could be an attempt to hide in plain sight. after all, no one is that stupid, right? </p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not listening anymore... First, I don't see anything to suggest that they are related. Secondly, I personally think it is terrible to apply guilt by association to family members if you happen to find that there is a familial link. Thirdly, this sub has become an intersection of too many unrelated conspiracy theories that defy their own logic. I mean, if Pizzagate is real, using the logic that children are taken and sex-trafficked, why would Gosnell perform late-term abortions and kill those babies? Gosnell would much more work into this hypothesis if he had been found to have surreptitiously delivered full-term live babies who then disappeared. Having read the complaints against him multiple times, I don't remember that being the case or implied at any time. </p></p>

        <p><p>The babies are killed for satanic rituals. Late term abortions, being the youngest, purest blood available, are the best form, according to Crowley </p></p>

        <p><p>The most important aspect of the ritual is the spilling of blood. The demons love the pain and torture, but the spilt blood is primary. </p></p>
