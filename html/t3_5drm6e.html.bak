        <strong>Another media outlet covers PIZZAGATE. Outlet is controlled by Hillary Clinton loyalist (backed by Rupert Murdoch). Dismisses entire investigation without any rational argument, calls it "conspiracy theory". (These people are so predictable.)</strong>
        <p><p>Posted this earlier, but didn't know much about this trashy outlet. They have only 190k followers on facebook. The reporting is totally sloppy and it appears they are just trying to get some attention since we're trending right now.</p>
<p>Archived so we don't give them any free traffic:</p>

<p>Background about heat street:</p>
<p>Louise Mensch privately tried to assist the Hillary Clinton campaign, emails published by Wikileaks reveal.
Mrs. Mensch runs the Rupert Murdoch-backed blog Heat Street, which claims to stand against identity politics and what it labels “social justice warriors” under the slogan “no safe spaces.”</p>
<p>However, its editor in chief, Mrs. Mensch, was caught writing a campaign advertisement script for the Democratic candidate – a woman who has traded off identity politics and social justice warrior politics. The ad appears to be based on the idea that Mrs. Clinton should be in office simply because she is female and is supported by “multiracial” women.</p>
<p>“… much rather have your girl Hillary,” Mrs. Mensch wrote in an email to Michael Kives of Creative Arts Agency (CAA), a former Clinton campaign advocate.</p></p>

        <p><p>So much for serious journalism. Notice that their hyperlink of Alefantis instagram includes a dozen or so comments and two of the most tame pics on his account.  And no mention of Marina Abramovic. </p>
<p>I'm sure that was an accident. </p></p>

        <p><p>Louise Mensch is a typical faux-right Establishment type, who tweets all day and night with PC attacks on Putin and Trump (racistsexistbigotislamophobe etc). She comes from a privileged upbringing in the UK, was a widely mocked Consrvative MP who was more concerned with make a name for herself as a celebrity and pundit than actual politics. She then quit and married a wealthy guy and now lives in Manhattan.</p>
<p>She had a mini meltdown on Twitter in recent weeks which was hilarious. Crowing about potential war with Russia when Hillary got in one second, then switching to 'Trump is a Putin agent' nonsense the next. Batshi.t crazy.</p>
<p>She even crowed about massive sanctions on Russia. When I tweeted back that these were real people who are already suffering, who would suffer more, not Purim personally - did she care? No, she called me a Putin agent and blocked me.</p>
<p>Heat St as far as I can tell is 'disinfo controlled right'. They try to be cutting edge by leading with the 'anti SJW' theme but once your in, the rest of their politics seem to be RINO / Globalist. It's about shepherding the right into the Globalist Corporatist fake right.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is the same Murdoch that lied about phone hacking with Milly Dowler, the total scumbag. Rebekah 'Crystal Tipps' Brooks also tried to destroy evidence in the form of a laptop. So yeah, they are totally a reputable paper and completely truthful. NOT.</p></p>

        <p><p>I used to support Heat Street, they seemed more balanced than the MSM or any alt-right news outlet. Not anymore.</p></p>
