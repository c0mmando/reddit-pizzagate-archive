        <strong>Article from 2008 about Frank Winstead accusing Comet Ping Pong of encouraging murders rapists</strong>
        <p><p>Someone posted and interview James Alefantis did on Yahoo. In it, he mentioned Transformer DC several times so I checked it out.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="http://transformerdc.org/news/current-news">News</a> section was a post in September from a sight called <a href="https://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/transformer-dc-turns-fifteen-this-season">Brightest Young Things </a> (wtf is with the creepy blood dripping from the top of the page)</p>
<p><strong>One of the articles is called <a href="https://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/from-ping-pong-pizza-to-rape-murder">From Ping Pong &amp; Pizza to Rape &amp; Murder</a></strong></p>
<p>In this article, it links to another story called <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/news/city-desk/blog/13055232/confronting-frank-winstead">Confronting Frank Winstead</a> which is from <strong>June 24, 2008!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>FTA: Frank Winstead: Folk hero to some, YouTube vigilante to others, and a total mystery to the press. The advisory neighborhood commissioner has made a name for himself by turning the ping-pong action in front of Comet into a grainy snuff film, and by referring to such ping-pong action as a short swat away from murder and rapes.</strong></p></p>

        <p><p>I got excited about this video at first, but it's actually just this guy Frank Wintesad concerned about people playing ping pong outside. However, this was a year before the article, so maybe noticing the activity out front got him to start digging deeper</p></p>

        <p><p>A lot of my thinking had to do with people talking about how they hide things in public view through art. When I saw the video on yahoo (sorry can't find the link/post) Alefantis talked a lot about this Transformer DC place which is an art center. He's also on the board of directors for Transformer</p></p>

        <p><p>He has a youtube account <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/fwinstead/videos">Frank Winstead</a></p>
<p>He looks more like a concerned citizen than anything according to his posts.</p>
<p>I'd like to find out more about the meeting where he made the outburst.</p>
<p>It says it happened during an ANC meeting (Advisory Neighborhood Commission?) Would there be minutes kept for this meeting somewhere?</p>
<p>EDIT: Apparently he was an ANC Commissioner
Also, i believe thi is his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fwinstead">Linked In</a> page that has the same image as the youtube page</p></p>

        <p><p>I found out that Frank Winstead should be in ward 3F according to his address that was listed in the article.</p>
<p>I wonder if there's any way to get the minutes of the meeting that occurred some time around June 24, 2008.</p>
<p>Most public meetings keep minutes don't they?</p>
<p>Edit: [Advisory Neighborhood Commissions] (http://anc.dc.gov/page/advisory-neighborhood-commission-3f)</p></p>
