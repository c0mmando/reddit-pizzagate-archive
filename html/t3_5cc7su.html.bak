        <strong>So... Illuminati actually confirmed?</strong>
        <p><p>Satanism? Check.<br>
Pedophilia? Check.<br>
International influence? Check.<br>
Politically connected? Check.<br>
Wealthy as fuck? Check.</p>
<p>BTW, compare your findings to these words, written in 1830 and said to have been translated from ancient scriptures.</p>
<p>"For behold, [...] they began to set their hearts upon their riches; yea, they began to seek to get gain that they might be lifted up one above another; therefore they began to commit secret murders, and to rob and to plunder, that they might get gain.</p>
<p>"And now behold, those murderers and plunderers were a band who had been formed by Kishkumen and Gadianton. And now it had come to pass that there were many, even among the Nephites, of Gadianton’s band."</p>
<p>"[B]ehold, Satan did stir up the hearts of the more part of the Nephites, insomuch that they did unite with those bands of robbers, and did enter into their covenants and their oaths, that they would protect and preserve one another in whatsoever difficult circumstances they should be placed, that they should not suffer for their murders, and their plunderings, and their stealings."</p>
<p>"And thus they might murder, and plunder, and steal, and commit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness, contrary to the laws of their country and also the laws of their God."</p>
<p>"Now behold, those secret oaths and covenants did not come forth unto Gadianton from the records which were delivered unto Helaman; but behold, they were put into the heart of Gadianton by that same being who did entice our first parents to partake of the forbidden fruit—</p>
<p>"Yea, that same being who did plot with Cain, that if he would murder his brother Abel it should not be known unto the world. And he did plot with Cain and his followers from that time forth.</p>
<p>"And also it is that same being who put it into the hearts of the people to build a tower sufficiently high that they might get to heaven. And it was that same being who led on the people who came from that tower into this land; who spread the works of darkness and abominations over all the face of the land, until he dragged the people down to an entire destruction, and to an everlasting hell.</p>
<p>"Yea, it is that same being who put it into the heart of Gadianton to still carry on the work of darkness, and of secret murder; and he has brought it forth from the beginning of man even down to this time.</p>
<p>"And behold, it is he who is the author of all sin. And behold, he doth carry on his works of darkness and secret murder, and doth hand down their plots, and their oaths, and their covenants, and their plans of awful wickedness, from generation to generation according as he can get hold upon the hearts of the children of men."</p>

        <p><p>Illuminati? Who knows</p>
<p>Are there elites who are satanic pedophiles and freemasons that go to the Bohemian Grove and do "mock" sacrifices to Molloch? Yes. </p></p>

        <p><p>Don't throw the Freemasons in that group.  They're not part of it.  Quite the opposite, in fact.</p></p>

        <p><p>They're pretty much completely unrelated. Is it possible some of the sick stuff was started by people who used to be freemasons? Sure, maybe? But Freemasons operate pretty openly and publicly. You can literally walk into one and join.</p></p>

        <p><p>Basically the name Illuminati is probably just a disinfo tool at this point. I think like 200 years ago the Illuminati started out as a way to infiltrate the Vatican and break its influence over world politics. The name just got used as a short hand for covert politics but to the point that it has no real meaning anymore. By exposing the things that you are uncovering, you are actually the new Illuminati. </p>
<p>Well that's just my opinion anyway. </p></p>
