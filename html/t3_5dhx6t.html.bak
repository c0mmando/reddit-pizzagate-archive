        <strong>Kickstarter to hire Private Detectives?</strong>
        <p><p>Just an idea, but it seems we could come up with a list of VIP's in this case and at least have them tailed/monitored.
As a half-joke: maybe we could contact the Pinkerton's? It would certainly bring media attention if that sounds appealing; given their sordid history.</p></p>

        <p><p>We could benefit alot from investigators with access to forensics labs. For example, somebody could go to the comet ping pong and look for hair in suspicious locations. Could then ID the owner of the hair, maybe make connections to missing children?</p></p>

        <p><p>What would be required is a few select and vetted folks from this sub to start and operate the Kickstarter.
Then a list of players will be organized and PI agencies located close to these POI's will be vetted and contacted.
It would be a huge workload, but we need gumshoes on the ground if we're ever going to get any solid evidence.</p></p>

        <p><p>From someone that has years of experience in law enforcement, let me say this... Don't waste your money on one with what has been mentioned using it for so far.
Contrary to TV and days of old, a PI isn't going to be able to provide you with much more in this case. In my opinion. Most PI's these days are simple follow and snap photos of your cheating spouse. A few have paid money to be able run a few tags or maybe a simple background check. They can find out the legal background of a business ( just like many hear have done) they can follow people etc..  They might dig in someone's trash for you but probably not go in somewhere and collect hair samples...and even if they did, the lab costs to have anything more than a drug test done on it would be very expensive .</p>
<p>Let me just say, DEPENDING on what you expect a PI to do for you in this case, it may be super expensive or not worth the effort. </p>
<p>I'm not saying not do it, just be aware of what one can legally do before you start raising money</p></p>

        <p><p>So, "Mr. Experience": How much does surveillance equipment cost, second mortgage level? What are the legalities of non-consent recording vs consent recording states? In what states is one required to obtain a PI's license before acting as one? What of conceal carry states combined with castle laws as applied to ones personal property, such as a car?</p>
<p>-These reasons are why it would be asking far too much for an inexperienced individual to take on a task that is required here:</p>
<p>And honestly, for such a USELESS opine, you DO sound like someone with "experience in law enforcement".</p></p>

        <p><p>I will answer regardless of the tone..</p>
<p>Equipment isn't cheap</p>
<p>DC is a one party consent state regarding phone calls, any other recordings you must have a warrant.</p>
<p>DC is no gun, other jurisdictions require conceal carry, just like civilians</p>
<p>In DC think of a PI license more as a business license, it gives you no special powers. </p></p>
