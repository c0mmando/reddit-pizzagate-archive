        <strong>32-minute evidence video: Pizzagate = .01% pedophilia, satanism.

        <p><p>This article is so poorly written it hurts.  Not to say it's false at all- but the titlegore continues through the entire piece.</p>
<p>Hard to imagine a teacher wrote it.  I'd fail a student for writing like that.  </p>
<p>Who says "lie-started?"  Why not something easy like "illegitimate" or even "wars of false pretense?"</p></p>

<p>I always thought this song was just mocking conspiracy theorists... Written in 1997... Same group had a song about how Noriega loved to molest kids... 1997 is a bit early to the game to blame Hillary for grinding up orphan babies. </p></p>

        <p><p>This is getting creepy. I listen to a lot of Bad Religion while looking at this stuff to break the monotony, but now I've found that a BR member is a possible lead? </p>
<p>Being bluepilled looks better every day, but it's sadly just not in my nature.</p></p>

        <p><p>I pray that no Green Day members or My Chemical Romance members are connected, or better yet this entire thing is definitively proven false. That would be nearly my entire music library. Was literally listening to BR before I clicked on this.</p></p>

        <p><p>The emails are faked and this was one big Discordian operation. Research Discordianism and you'll see </p>
<p><a href="http://historiadiscordia.com/discordians-in-the-news-wikileaks-exposes-hillary-as-a-secret-discordian/">For example </a> </p>
<p>The entire thing is an operation based on this understanding </p>

<p>"It is my belief that it is a mistake to hold firm beliefs"</p>

        <p><p>As a pope of discordianism I make you a pope of discordianism for eternity. </p>
<p>Seriously have you read the Principia it's just a joke. One of the sacred laws is to never eat hotdogs with buns but Friday you can only eat hot dogs with buns. There is also the holy chao etc. Robert Anton Wilson one of the founders is also dead....</p>
<p>Look up the pentabarf it says that on Friday the day of that email you eat hotdogs with buns. Another of the 5 Creed's is to not believe anything you read</p></p>

        <p><p>They're trying to spin it as she is a discordian and the email is fucking Friday the day discordian are meant to eat with a bun. It's a joke religion go to the wiki page on discordianism and ctr f pentabarf (the 5 commandments of the religion)</p>
<p>Copy paste</p>
<p>The PentabarfEdit</p>
<p>The Pentabarf are 5 rules of Discordianism. As venerators of Eris, Discordian views vary from one person to the next as neither order or disorder, nor chaos are requisites of falling into the Discordian category. The fifth rule is representative of that.[citation needed]</p>
<p>There is no Goddess but Goddess and She is Your Goddess. There is no Erisian Movement but The Erisian Movement and it is The Erisian Movement. And every Golden Apple Corps is the beloved home of a Golden Worm.</p>
<p>A Discordian Shall Always use the Official Discordian Document Numbering System.</p>
<p>A Discordian is Required during his early Illumination to Go Off Alone &amp; Partake Joyously of a Hot Dog on a Friday; this Devotive Ceremony to Remonstrate against the popular Paganisms of the Day: of Catholic Christendom (no meat on Friday), of Judaism (no meat of Pork), of Hindic Peoples (no meat of Beef), of Buddhists (no meat of animal), and of Discordians (No Hot Dog Buns).</p>
<p>A Discordian shall Partake of No Hot Dog Buns, for Such was the Solace of Our Goddess when She was Confronted with The Original Snub.</p>
<p>A Discordian is Prohibited of Believing What he Reads.</p>
<p>For a second there I thought they might be on to something but meme magic is real the email she asks for a hot dog with no bun is Friday so clearly she is a heretic </p></p>

<p>CONVENTIONAL CHAOS</p>
<p>GREYFACE</p>
<p>In the year 1166 B.C., a malcontented hunchbrain by the name of Greyface, got it into his head that the universe was as humorless as he, and he began to teach that play was sinful because it contradicted the ways of Serious Order. "Look at all the order around you," he said. And from that, he deluded honest men to believe that reality was a straightjacket affair and not the happy romance as men had known it.</p>
<p>It is not presently understood why men were so gullible at that particular time, for absolutely no one thought to observe all the disorder around them and conclude just the opposite. But anyway, Greyface and his followers took the game of playing at life more seriously than they took life itself and were known even to destroy other living beings whose ways of life differed from their own.</p>
<p>The unfortunate result of this is that mankind has since been suffering from a psychological and spiritual imbalance. Imbalance causes frustration, and frustration causes fear. And fear makes for a bad trip. Man has been on a bad trip for a long time now.</p>
<p>It is called THE CURSE OF GREYFACE.</p>
<p>Bullshit makes 
the flowers grow 
&amp; that's beautiful.</p></p>

        <p><p>From what I've read of Haiti they seem to purposefully and ritualistically  sow death, confusion, famine, disease, and hatred within non white populations. It goes all the way back to Bush senior violently taking over the country in 1991. </p></p>
