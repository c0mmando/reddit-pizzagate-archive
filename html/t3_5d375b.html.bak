        <p><p>Already replied to the other thread, but I'll post here too to make people that see this not worry about the creepy "cold cheese" part :P</p>
<p>The "Donald Trump earn 8k plan" thing is a known spam phrase that includes random reviews from Yelp on the bottom to bypass spam filters, see two examples here:
http://markmail.org/message/bh72oszw7qcwub7l</p>
<p>The "cold cheese" part came from a genuine review on Yelp, posted on 10/10/2015. See here:

        <p><p>Re: Trump's plan for Americans to earn 7-8k per month, only here- http://bestbuy.swiftcake.eu/check </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nice parking lot. Comfortable seating at the bar. Food was delicious and fast. Nice bright and clean environment. Top notch service. The cocktails were great. This is the best pizza around ! Make sure you try it with cold cheese on top. We order from Donte's on a regular basis, and have never had a bad experience.... First time here \u0026 definitely not the last. Wasn't sure because of the dated appearance but saw the great reviews \u0026 had to try. Glad I did. ..Nice hearty... It is what it is and doesn't try to be anything different-a cozy dive bar with a homey feel. We came here this past Friday night to catch the 2nd and 3rd... I drive past Mitty's every day on my way to class and finally had time today to stop in for lunch at 11 right when they opened. Service was fast and polite... Delicious! The Mac and cheese burger is amazing and the fries are delicious (and huge ... We each got a small fry and it was too much, so next time we coule9d5726d67d2992e0994d5e1bac98ff8</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, this stands out because it has nothing to do with the title (Trump's plan). Also there's another URL link that leads you to 'page not found'</p>
<p>Anyone know what is being referred to with <strong>\u0026</strong> ?</p></p>
