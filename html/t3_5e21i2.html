        <strong>Questions. Should there be a petition to NYPD to investigate this? Or some other means to systematically 'bother' them and keep track of it?</strong>
        <p><p>Has anyone organized a way to get Pizzagate information to the authorities? I know "sources" inside NYPD state they are supposedly looking into something, but shouldn't we be systematically 'bothering' them? I'm concerned the topic will become ubiquitous to them and branded as "conspiracy." Ideas?</p>
<p>I know some have used the NYPD and/or FBI tip line, but there doesn't seem to be a count on that. Thoughts?</p></p>

        <p><p>We need to get Alex Jones or Joe Rogan to help get the word out there first. </p></p>

        <p><p>If we can get somebody articulate to go on Joe Rogan or Bill Burr to talk about this in long form it'd reach a much wider audience and they've in the past been willing to at least hear out controversial people and topics. Bill Burr is very well known for his casual research into the Illuminati and publicly calling out that HRC goes to those "Eyes Wide Shut" parties and he'll talk about that stuff on Conan O'Brian. </p></p>

        <p><p>I wish there was a way to do that. I've seen some tweet at them without results. I think they'd pay attention if we started something at Change.org, but who knows.</p></p>

        <p><p>Or why isn't Fox News or Drudge or Breitbart writing/talking about this?</p></p>
