        <strong>Previously undiscovered Pizza related Wikileaks emails have surfaced</strong>
        <p><p>These were submitted to us by someone who wanted to remain anonymous, so I am posting them here for people to check out. Important to compare them to past "code" language emails that have been scrutinized to see if anything new comes up.</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/23705</p>
<p>"Cheers from Dushanbe w nary a Godfather's pizza in sight."</p>

<p>This email talks about her Robertas Pizza party which has been talked about already.</p></p>

        <p><p>They are talking political strategy against Herman Caine. At the end of the email they say "cheers, Sid" and he is replying cheers back and basically saying no Herman Cain here. Dushanbe is in Tajikistan. No code there it's a real place I have been to several times. </p></p>
