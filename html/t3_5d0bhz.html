        <strong>Interesting symbols/Artwork at the OTHER pizza place</strong>
        <p><p>In the Wikileaks emails we find HRC holding a birthday party in NY at Roberta's ... Web search shows photos of her and Bill visiting at other times. Reports on the web that it's her favorite pizza place.. </p>
<p>A quick look I spotted what looks like an exact match to the The signs the FBI released.
As well as pentagrams, upside down crosses, twin lightning bolts etc..</p>

<p>That's a close up of a menu/chalkboard on the patio dining area.
Larger view here</p>

<p>There is another menu board inside, that I can make out a wizard type drawing but that's about it</p>
<p>http://imgur.com/tZgBKFc</p>
<p>Out side on the patio area is another sign "where do babes come from" not sure what that's about, but seems odd in a public dining area</p>

<p>This is also the place that had the slightly odd event flyer for a pizza place, and at one time offered the 700.00 leather tank top with a pentagram on it.</p>

<p>I know it's supposed to be a cool hipster place, but seeing how it looks on the outside and the shipping containers etc... I have a hard time with a Former president, and sec of state etc.  coming here for a pizza...</p>

<p>Maybe there is more to it that I don't see</p></p>

        <p><p>someone mentioned that chicken lover was someone into little kids or little boys or something like that.</p>
<p>With that in mind, on the flyer, notice: Spit Roasted Chicken. Where else does spit roasting come up? MFM, MMM, and Cannibalism (fetish). That's not including strap-ons.</p>
<p>Something else.... face painting.... a pizza slice onto a child's face. With greasy drippy cheese. I may be overthinking it but... fuck man... that's... I'm not even going to describe what that description is conjuring. Ugh.</p>
<p>Edit: Pizza toppings have to be a code, too. Why pepperoni or pepperoni and mushroom?</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah I saw that.. It's different.. And in any other context I probably wouldn't have noticed it but when we are talking about someone of this status visiting places, it's not what you would expect</p></p>

        <p><p>From now on I choose my pizza places based solely on the number of pentagrams visible, cause I guess that's directly related to pizza goodness Sheese these people</p></p>
