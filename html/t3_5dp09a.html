        <strong>Reminder about icwatch - which contains backups of profiles you want to see but are private nor or information was hidden</strong>

<p>MY GOODMAN: Julian Assange, can you talk about ICWatch and what it is?</p>
<p>JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, ICWatch is a database of more than 27,000 profiles of people associated with the U.S. intelligence community or intelligence industry, so that includes people who work for government and people who work for private industry. It was created by a little journalism startup, a great bunch of guys, called Transparency Toolkit. And so they launched this a couple of weeks ago. This information was all originally in the public domain, or seemingly in the public domain, from LinkedIn, so these are CVs of people involved in various intelligence activities. By searching LinkedIn for key works, so they used, for example, the National Security Agency documents or names of special task forces or the, say, Joint Priority Effects List, the assassination program in Afghanistan, these were scraped out and then linked together so you can easily see, for example, who claims that they had worked at the National Security Agency at some stage or on various code-worded projects that the National Security Agency uses. As a result of doing that, they faced counterattack. And the counterattack was some quite serious death threats from—</p>
<p>AMY GOODMAN: This is for Intelligence Community Watch, ICWatch—</p>
<p>JULIAN ASSANGE: Yes.</p>
<p>AMY GOODMAN: —for creating it, for indexing what already is in the public domain.</p>
<p>JULIAN ASSANGE: Indexing what was already public. An example of one of those death threats, from Washington, D.C., from a counterintelligence operative, who was also a former marine, saying that he would hunt them down and kill them no matter where they were in the world, and there’s no place in the world that they can hide.</p>
<p>AMY GOODMAN: As specifically what is quoted in your press release, "I promise [that] I will kill everyone involved in your website. There is nowhere on this earth that you will be able to hide from me."</p>
<p>JULIAN ASSANGE: Yes. So I think that—and there was a number of other such threats.
