        <p><p>Maybe this is why he is trying to expose it globally. </p>
<p>If he just came out and said "the world is run by satanic pedophiles" people would conclude that he's gone insane. </p>
<p>But if he were to become a bastion for someone to leak the proof, he could then objectively present the truth to the world. </p></p>

        <p><p>Nothing really to say.</p>
<p>The official story is that his mother got out and took he children with her, but there is plausible speculation to say that it was just a cover, and that Julian was really with the leader of the cult.  All the children had multiple identities and multiple passports.</p>
<p>Here is a Guardian story:  https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/20/growing-up-with-the-family-inside-anne-hamilton-byrnes-sinister-cult</p>
<p>In the Guardian article, it's chilling.  You'll note that Assange said he was never a member.</p>
<p>Here's some aggregates:  https://newsfromdownunder.quora.com/Julian-Assange-and-the-cult-leader-close-to-death</p>
<p>While this particular LSD fueled child abuse cult is no longer run by it's leader, it was a doomsday group that taught the kids that they would be the elite after the apocalypse.  </p>
<p>And not only the 28 children that Hamilton-Byrne raised, but she had access to many, many children that were signed over to her.  Were there more that the 28?</p></p>
