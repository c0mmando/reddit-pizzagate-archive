        <strong>Anyone here remember how True Detectives was based one a real story?</strong>
        <p><p>So hey guys first time posting here. I got curious about tying in some previous incidences of weirdness and seeing if it all can trace back to pizzagate. These incidences happened in Louisiana over a period of at least 20 years. That puts at the time Arkansas Senator Bill Clinton a close neighbor to all this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/25/us/sex-charges-follow-a-churchs-collapse.html">in 2005 a Hosanna Church pastor in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana was charged with multiple charges of child rape. 8 other key members were charged including a deputy. <strong>THEY DID THIS UNDER SATANIC RITUALS</strong> His name and information online is hidden. Most local press was too ashamed I guess to write any details. Neither is there very much information on the other perpetrators. Actually there is nothing in the press. I would have to dig into actual court documents to unravel these names and the nature of these rituals, and more importantly who did they associate with.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Paul_Hebert">So I moved on to the big fish of lake Pontchartrain. Dennis Herbert was a democrat from this tiny parish serving on the district 73 of House of Representatives of Louisiana from 1972-1996. That is not far away from Bill Clinton during his prime years before potus.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://tinatrent.com/?p=6890">I wonder if Thomas Alfred Taylor knew any of these people.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.legis.la.gov/legisdocs/members/h1812-2020.pdf">The Next Person I want to bring up is Gerald Theunissen who is also a democrat of that HoR of Louisiana. He left 1996 to serve as state senator when Bill was potus.</a>

<p>I think there is more information. True detectives was based on this story. This church also had schools, this was a massive ring with state funds feeding it.</p></p>

        <p><p>Do any of you know how to access court docs online, or do you have to go to the actual district. Chances are they are all sealed too.</p></p>

        <p><p>The second season probably ties in to it as well... Elite sex parties, cover-ups, corruption</p></p>
