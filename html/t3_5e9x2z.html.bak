        <p><p>"GET THE WORD OUT SHARE SHARE LETS GET THESE DEMONS
This video only brushes the surface of all the information
much has been left out. But I urge you to look yourself at the links below. Do we need to catch them red handed killing a child for law enforcement to even investigate? All the things uncovered from the video of bohemian grove and now this. Is it that hard to believe that the ones in power are satanist and don't have your best interest in mind and would rather send your loved ones to die in wars that have been started under false claims of keeping you safe or spreading democracy. Wake up"</p></p>

        <p><p>People can believe that Julian Assange was kidnapped and killed and someone has been leaking emails for some strange reason. People can believe that all the voting machines were compromised and the George Soros is the face of all wrong doing in the world. They can believe all that but they can't believe that perhaps there are worse people out there than that. </p>
<p>Why don't we see pictures of the Rockerfellers lavish parties and sunny holidays? Or the Rothschilds? Surely they can't be SO in control and SO rich that not ONE picture of them gets leaked anywhere? </p></p>

        <p><p>Unless you can actually show anything, that's just a simple costume party. If you had stuff like CP playing in the background, sure, but not just odd costumes. It's like saying a kid dressing up as Satan for Halloween alone is enough evidence that kids are demonic.</p></p>

<p>That doesn't mean anything unless you can also tie it to something, like actual child sacrifice or something. Otherwise, it's just a bullshit claim.</p></p>

<p>#2 is ostensibly a taxidermied Deer head mask, you'd have to have some f'd up proclivities to want to wear that imo</p>
<p>Edit: deer heads seem to have relation with st. Hubertas group Scalia was involved with</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't trust newsflashes anymore. </p>
<p>I think you need to chill out man. You're missing the point being made here. The rich and powerful are secret. They're hidden from plain sight. The Rothschilds have been behind a lot of big historical events. When shit goes down throughout history you will find these guys sitting in the corner with shit all over their face and hands and a big grin on their face. </p></p>

        <p><p>No, I'm not missing the point. It doesn't matter how much shady shit they're behind, if you start making baseless assertions from activities everyday people will most likely experience at least once in their life the movement loses credibility. Show this weird shit when you also have evidence of crimes, not before.</p></p>

        <p><p>No we don't because even though do catch them killing a child they will continue covering, they will keep cencoring and prevent creating a public opinion. However, more we share and more we speak about it, more they will think they are in a situation where there is no going back. There is a limit to cencorship and cover-ups too, a limit which we are getting closer every second</p></p>

        <p><p>FYI, websites and other youtubers have been DMCA'd for using the FB/instagram photos already. The guy who made the first video had some deleted for "profanity" and the new upload was then age restricted to reduce views (have to be signed in). </p>
<p>He advises not to use pictures or backgrounds and to not get angry or curse when you are discussing this subject. </p></p>

        <p><p>I am also a european atheist, and it seems to me often that no one but the stupid over there are REALLY christian... but I guess that says more about me than the truth. In my mind, the only thing sillier than christians is basically satanists... I would definitely hold off on all the demon bla bla if you want to be taken seriously outside of the US at least...</p></p>

        <p><p>All of the high profile cases I have looked at from the 70s and 80s do not seem to have any religious aspect. It is fucked up shit that involved child abuse or sounds like the evil things a child would come up with. I can recommend a great episode of stuffyoushouldknow about ritual abuse if you'd like?</p></p>

        <p><p>It's funny because when you make a wild correlation you're a shill, but when they say the shape of a pizza is satan's horns then it's all fine and dandy. These people are just in it for the show, they want this to be real and will convince themselves no matter how stupid it sounds. </p></p>
