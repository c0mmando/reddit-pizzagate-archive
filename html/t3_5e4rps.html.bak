        <strong>Has anyone actually here actually VISITED the pizza place?</strong>
        <p><p>Everyone links to pictures and videos, but how about someone goes in Project Veritas-style and documents what is really like in there? </p>
<p>I mean, it seems like all this info we have is conjecture and theories. Why doesn't someone go in and LOOK at what's going on? If there's kids running around unsupervised. If there are hidden rooms and hallways, etc.</p></p>

        <p><p>One Periscoper went in there, walked around and was asked to leave. He had a 3 part on Youtube. Nothing aside from that. Also they're on high alert. Cops were called on them too.  Not safe to be poking around now, or ever again I'm assuming. That's how you get arrested, etc. It looked like they had a bodyguard too.</p></p>

        <p><p>That's nuts. It just seems like we only have so much access to information on the web. Some traditional investigation would be helpful I think. Like monitoring people who go in and out. Establishing patterns and a time line. We could all pitch in a couple bucks and hire a PI to stake it out. </p></p>

        <p><p>No, You can board them up quickly. Plywood. But that would have to be delivered at Night?</p>
<p>PS There's an underground level in that strip mall, because there's a caf√© under that Politics &amp; Whatever bookstore.</p></p>

        <p><p>pull off the plywood &amp; tunnel's still there.  That's my point.  Not easy to truck in tons of dirt and get it packed in down there.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't know about that. Did you watch Ted Fungerson's speech? They literally filled the underrgound basement with cement to hide the evidence, and he needed to hire an archeologist to confirm that there was once a basement there. Do you think a PI would be able to do all that while the cops are literally acting as security guards at the place?</p></p>

        <p><p>Would be so fucking intense to get footage like this. if someone would do this he should prepare well, maybe with the help of this community. but he should also be aware that everyone can read this, so the pizza guys could know when he is coming.</p></p>

        <p><p>There was that one guy about a week ago (around Nov 13th/14th) who said he was going to DC to go searching... Not sure of where the post is.</p>
<p>Found it: https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cxj8m/announcement_flying_to_dc_for_2_week_private/
Checked his history and come to the conclusion he sucks.</p></p>
