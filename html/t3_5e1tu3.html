        <strong>These women provided drawings showing how the politicians torture and raped them as children. They don't even know each other -- and their drawings have IDENTICAL themes (WARNING: do not view if you are sensitive - you won't be the same)</strong>
        <p><p>Similarities to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>cattle prods or wand-like devices that cause pain on the child's body</li>
<li>children being restrained by adults, pinned to walls, mounted by large adults</li>
<li>pain and torture and sexual mutilation causing dissociation or out of body experience</li>
<li>handkerchiefs being placed underneath the child's body as the politician rapes the child (remember podesta's "pizza-related" handkerchief and how important it was to them in the emails? makes me sick to my stomach)</li>
<li>restraints, isolation, psychological torment, experimentation, memory erasure, reconditioning of core personality</li>
<li>dark entities that do not look fully human, evil symbols and sacrificial ceremonies (could be that the humans wore masks to scare the children or might be something spiritual/extraterrestrial -- no way to know for sure right now) </li>
</ul>
<p>Note again: we have no indication that these women know each other. They both made it out alive. They both provided drawings of what happened. Result: <strong><em>independent, multiple attestation and corroboration.</em></strong> </p>
<p>Folks, this is real. It literally brings tears to my eyes. They aren't making it up and have nothing to gain, and it checks out. </p>
<p><strong><em>Warning: do not view if you don't have to. What you are about to see will likely change your view of the world </em></strong></p>
<p>First is Cathy Fox: https://cathyfox.wordpress.com/2015/11/30/my-story-fiona-barnett-hang-on-for-the-ride/</p>
<p>Second is Kim Noble: https://www.flickr.com/photos/62206346@N08/sets/72157626474399453/detail/</p>
<p>Also, if you can stomach it, here is a teenage girl who provides video testimony, in tears, of what happened (of course they called her "crazy" and so forth). </p>
<p>She describes:</p>
<ul>
<li>cannibalism </li>
<li>she was forced to eat feces and other infants </li>
<li>they impregnated her, then took the fetus out and killed it/raped it/forced her to eat it</li>
<li>how they got rid of the bodies ("they put the bodies in a tub and poured liquid n them, then there would be sludge at the bottom"): </li>
</ul>
<p>Here she is (warning applies): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72OznY9ByZo</p>
<p>Look into that girl's eyes and try to tell me she is "just a conspiracy theorist."</p>
<p>She is clearly describing real events. </p>
<p>This is what we are going up against folks. </p>
<p>PS - I also suspect that Biljana Djurdjevic is a victim, though she has not come forward and confirmed publicly. Here is her art (which Podesta loves to collect, I'm guessing as a keepsake to hide in plain sight): https://www.google.com/search?q=biljana+Djurdjevic&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1301&amp;bih=577&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi24piEybnQAhUk8YMKHcgzC8kQ_AUIBigB</p>
<p>Note the similar themes again as you click through her work. </p>
<ul>
<li>dark circles, hypnotic looks in the child's eyes, looks of fear and trauma</li>
<li>restrained, tied up, disposal of bodies</li>
<li>vicious dogs that maul children as the politicians watch in pleasure</li>
<li>torture instruments and dismemberment, etc. </li>
</ul></p>

        <p><p>There is no longer any reason to discredit these people's accounts.  At the very least they are worth looking into further.  Up until a couple of months ago most of us would have brushed these accounts off as meaningless.  We can't let shit like this slide anymore.  Good chance these people are telling the truth.  And if they are, they are living in hell. </p></p>

        <p><p>vip abuse rings have been rumored for years and dismissed as too unbelievable. even when the evidence i see makes sense, my own brain keeps telling me it's too unbelievable. that's how they keep getting away with it.</p>
<p>i think what is unfolding here is the closest anyone has gotten to the answers and the names. keep going.</p></p>

        <p><p>Not saying this is false at all but I've seen the documentary posted on /r/documentaries and if I remember correctly, the comments said that this girl was a victim of therapy where memories were implanted into the girl. Any info on this?</p>

        <p><p>False memory syndrome = concept started by pedophiles to discredit exactly these stories. The founders of the assn that pushed the idea were mostly pedophiles. False memory syndrome is a shill concept. Everything that girl and those like her say, is real. It's verified by legal and govt docs just have to take time to link. (Finders, Franklin, Dutroux - the LEGAL docs in these cases. = total verification)</p></p>

        <p><p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Memory_Syndrome_Foundation</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_J._Freyd</p>
<p>"Freyd and his wife Pamela founded the False Memory Syndrome Foundation in 1992,[3] after Freyd was accused of sexual abuse by his daughter Jennifer.[3][4] Freyd denies the accusations.[5]"</p>
<p>Note that the founders of this group have no qualifications except being accused of abuse. No degrees in psychiatry, not counselors, not social workers. Claiming a "syndrome" with no credibility behind them to substantiate it at all. This was a sham group created by abusers to discredit victims &amp; make their testimony less likely to be believed. </p></p>

        <p><p>I hope I can reassure everyone by saying this:  I have a very successful career in the tech/entertainment industry.  I have been quietly studying this subject matter for over 15 years for fear of being ridiculed if I came out publicly about the fact that I thought these accusations, rumors, and stories might be true, that I would be decried as a "nut" a "cook" or worse.  Also, a part of me thought it was the stuff of government organized disinformation through potential mind controlled puppets like David Icke, to distract us from intellectual investigation of more pressing government cover ups and false flags.  But the incidents that have been exposed through the wikileaks emails, and "Pizzagate" have shown me that my hunches were right all along, and to a scale that I could not have properly imagined.  What we are seeing here in Pizzagate is not an isolated pedophile ring, we are seeing a worldwide control mechanism that is more sick and evil than we could ever imagine.  But we must see the light bursting through the end of the tunnel.  With the power of the internet, and the seismic destabilization of the corporate media, we are projecting truth across all platforms in way that has never been possible in our existence.  The corporate media has now taken a back seat to the citizen journalism of Reddit, youtube and other sites.  WE have the power to take our world back from the evil controllers, and Pizzagate is the first crack in the wall in destroying their unimaginably evil empire.  </p>
<p>Let's continue to be on the front lines.  With each new shot fired, container of acid thrown, grenade launched, and hammer swung, we are breaking the wall.  It will soon come down!!</p></p>

        <p><p>Your path to truth resonates with me. For years I have thought deeply about the origin of the mechanisms of control. </p>
<p>I have always arrived at the conclusion, through a chain of deductive inferences, that there must be an insidious form of evil at the rock bottom of it all.  </p>
<p>Despite arriving logically at such a conclusion, I figured I must be missing something, because it is too extraordinary to comprehend. </p>
<p>People like Alex Jones say "satanic pedophiles rule the world!"</p>
<p>And David Icke says "reptilian child torturers rule the world!"</p>
<p>And I admit I've never wanted to align myself with such beliefs. </p>
<p>After carefully reviewing all of the emails and the pizzagate information over the last few weeks, however, I am finding myself forced to confront what I have always arrived at on logically independent grounds: the highest levels of power are not comprised of corrupt crooks, but by dark principalities whose origins quite possibly span eons of time.</p>
<p>I will not say anything more about what those principalities might be, but I can no longer deny the reality of horrendous evil, the scope of which cannot be articulated without sounding crazy.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly agree that we are living in a time where we have a great opportunity to step up and realize our power. </p>
<p>Their only hope is to slaughter us like cattle now, mass extermination, because they can't control us anymore. Their best form of control -- control of our mind via the centralized media complex -- has failed on almost all fronts. So it is far more practical for them to decimate us now, and begin anew, than it is for them to manage us.  </p>
<p>I just hope I get to take a few of the bastards down with me when they make their move. It would be a blessing. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, this is making me start to think the sandyhook stuff actually was a hoax in order to control the guns.  This is hard for me, coming from a Democratic background and previously wanting gun control.  Now I actually think they are actively trying to limit our ability to fight back when they declare martial law and start the crack down.</p></p>

        <p><p>Regarding Sandy Hook, I felt sort of crazy for questioning it as it was happening, but something in me knew so many pieces didn't add up. I think one of the things that sealed it for me was how the FBI was keeping people away and in the middle of the investigation they totally demolished the building. How could any investigative agency allow a crime scene to be demolished in the middle of the investigation? </p></p>

        <p><p>I've always wondered why no wounded were taken out.  20 kids died and several adults, and I don't recall any medical help for them, just an announcement that they died. Their bodies were kept in there, which is understandable for an investigation, but for how long? It was weird.</p>
<p>And the video (news footage) of the people literally walking in circles into the building and out of the building, around some cars, back into the building - that was weird. If you track each person specifically, they just walk in circles for ages. So weird.</p></p>

        <p><p>What did it for me was the "near perfect headshot ratio" that Lanza was able to achieve and the fact that in the case of Sandy Hook, it was as if all normal "standard operating procedure" was completely done away with.</p>
<p>But I am with all of you.  I was open to the idea of a couple of our elites being involved in some sort of satanic child trafficking and rape ring.... But never did I think it would come out the way it did.  I think we always had hopes for that "anonymous dump to end all dumps".. but as the years went on... I think many lost hope.</p>
<p>So much for that.. because after looking at the emails.. I've had to come to accept some very hard truths.  That, yes, the most powerful people in the world are satanic child murderers.. I think was scares me more though is how much of a cross section of "not so powerful" people mixed up in this shit that can directly make our lives a living hell.</p>
<p>So be careful.. remember, when you report this stuff to law enforcement, law enforcement themselves may be compromised.</p></p>

        <p><p>No doubt. There was hysteria on the mainstream media over mass shootings and gun control what seemed like every week for a while and it just seemed so...fabricated. I guess this was why the founders put in the 2nd amendment in the first place. I hate guns but i think everyone needs to start hiding theirs...</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't know if I can go that far and claim it was a hoax, but it's a scary parallel that so many of these shooters have mental problems and are heavily medicated, and occult pedophiles supposedly using torture techniques and drugs in order to induce mental instability.</p>
<p>I can only hope that it's just silly "conspiracy theories" and not a shadowy web of degenerate evil.</p></p>

        <p><p>I feel like were living a version of the dark tower,  and were uncovering this great evil that hides among us and seeks to destroy us.  I know that will sound crazy to outsiders,  but after sifting through all of this,  and looking at the governmental policies and the reaction from major branches of it... I dont know what to believe anymore...i dont want to believe.  </p></p>

<p>The cover for this coming years economist magazine.  It is tarot cards with different pictures on them.  One of those pictures is a tower getting hit by a lightning bolt. </p></p>

        <p><p>Its a series by Stephen King,  it deals heavily with the metaphysical and the evil the protaganist is fighting is strikingly similar to the one presented here,  both in its spread in society and elements of satanism and mind control, and between me amd you, I think coincidences like that go a little deeper then pure happenstance.  Thanks for letting me know about this.  </p></p>

        <p><p>The Tower Card (Tarot) represents devastating and chaotic change.  It directly follows the Devil card in the deck.</p>
<p>Change does not come easily...people die, people suffer.  Yet in the end, it's the higher outcome that's important.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well he obviously wasn't "normal." He had been ritually abused as a child in the music industry. </p>
<p>He had a deep (pure) love for kids and wanted them to be safe. </p>
<p>Edit: He never really was able to progress mentally from childhood. Deep trauma tends to do that. He was mentally a child, and most comfortable around children. It was not sexual. </p></p>

        <p><p>Michael Jackson and his siblings might have been abused since they were small, sold out by their father.</p>
<p>When they got older, they probably got groomed into committing abuse too.</p></p>

<p>Michael Jackson was killed right before his "This is It" tour where he was going to expose the corruption in the music business:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is retarded. His dad is a piece of shit and is projecting - Michael Jackson died because he was addicted to drugs - he wasn't going to expose shit. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yes but don't dwell on it too much - it's tapping into a power based on self-serving interests and the predator-prey dynamic. Dark powers allow one to become a better predator but also allow one to be preyed upon by bigger predators.</p></p>

        <p><p>Magic is a misconception. Magic is another way of controlling energy flow and using it to your own purposess. Just because you are not familliar with it, it doesn't make it unreal.</p></p>

        <p><p>Exactly this. "Magic" is a word that has too many false connotations to be useful here. But those people who are doing those rituals know how to manipulate energy. Pain and torture focuses dark energy. </p></p>

        <p><p>It's irrelevant whether it's real. THEY believe it's real. And they are trying to turn their evil fantasies into reality, and that aff cat is all, whether you believe in magic, or even good and evil. FWIW I think here are things beyond our understanding and scientific explanation - this might not be magic in the pop culture sense, but there is certainly a dark energy which we can all feel when investigating Pizzagate</p></p>

        <p><p>This is quite interesting. I just finished reading Orphan Conspiracies and what is described here is a real mixed bag.</p>
<p>So my take is this...Operation Paperclip type of "experiments" in mind control that use both sexual and mental humiliation combined with pain. What I feel also happened is an input of false information so that merely telling the story will make the person seem insane.</p>
<p>For instance the 5 year old would have no concept or knowledge of Richard Nixon or Billy Graham (who was notorious for never permitting himself to be alone with a woman not his wife)....so anyone reading that will think..WTF NO? And discount her entire story.</p>
<p>Once you see the similarities it's easy to put this together...and easy to see why she is disbelieved.</p>
<p>Instilling fake into real (truth with fiction) along with terror will automatically make this unbelievable.</p>
<p>I see the correlation between these drawings and the artist Pedesto loves so much. </p>
<p>I am not believing a human sacrifice took place in a church in front of so many people. I believe that was input into her to make her entire story unbelieveable. Do I believe there was a Victoria, yes, was she murdered likely. And we can see that clearly victims become abusers because if the artist is such good pals with a perpetrator...she clearly has also become a perpetrator.</p>
<p>Do not allow yourself to disbelieve all of it because some of it is overly fantastic...that's the plan.</p>
<p>Also Moloch aka Jehovah aka Enil loves the scent of burnt meat and sacrifice...these idiots believe their satanic shit...and there's not enough time or space for me to explain why it's bullshit...they believe it and they do in fact practice it.</p>
<p>Because they instill unbelievable factors into the victims (and there are unbelievable factors here and they are easy to spot) gives people who cannot or are unwilling to dig or believe the rest...a comfortable exit.</p>
<p>The experiments on pain/pleasure are true...and think about this one...Moloch/Jehovah/Enil told his followers to cut off part of the penis...so a baby boy's very first sexual experience involves tremendous pain...the penis needs to be erect for the cutting.</p>
<p>There is much research on the long time effects of sexual pleasure and pain, and mind control.</p>
<p>The US gov. is massively compromised here as they actually sought out and protected Nazis who were conducting these experiments. From Operation Paperclip we have Montok and MK Ultra...all generally disbelieved because of the clever way they instill unbelievable aspects into the child's mind.</p></p>

        <p><p>Exactly. That's how it works. Many many aspects of her story correlate with what we know about Operation Paperclip, monarch/montok/MK Ultra...</p>
<p>Which USED to be conspiracy theories. What could be done here is looking back and pulling out elements (austies good at spotting patterns) and spreadsheeting it into dates, type of abuse...the sex/pain/pleasure obedience thing...yes...rape/oral/anal yes...</p>
<p>but servicing Richard Nixon on a plane? Probably not...was she in a plane setting and told that's what she was doing...likely.</p>
<p>Did they seek to control her by telling her that Victoria was murdered in a massive blood rite? Absolutely...did they do that? Probably not..is Victoria murdered? Yes.</p>
<p>You see how easily the mind fuck combines truth with fiction?</p></p>

        <p><p>Listening to that English girl's voice alone convinces me. Not too long ago I myself suffered a deeply traumatic personal experience (of course nothing in the magnitude of what that poor girl went through) which left me feeling I was a walking corpse. I had to give a research presentation for a final only a few days after being hospitalized, and when I got up to speak everything went well, except my voice had a similarly hollow and drained sound to it. That's what struck me the most about her testimony; I don't even need to see her haunting expression or listen to the words to know that that pain is real.</p></p>

        <p><p>Greetings Brothers and Fighters...
I was in Iraq this year documenting and interviewing victims of ISIS.  The Yazidi People.  It is SHOCKING how similar and accurate this information is to the interviews and testimony of escaped sex slaves that we interviewed.  Not completely but in a lot of ways.  </p>
<p>I am shocked.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes! I actually believe I went as a beard for an undercover operation.  Its a bold statement and its not my first time saying it pubically but the "producer" I went with did not know the most BASIC information about film and video making.  A lot of other odd things and when I texted him prior to the election when it was first rumored that Clinton was supplying ISIS and asked him, he said no fucking way. </p>
<p>Also, strange as it is the company that hired and took me didnt lay me on time and I made a fuss about it.  They claimed a check was in the mail. I expressed two months late was unacceptable and needed it sooner.   The next day I was overnighted a personal check from Connecticut.  Very weird.  </p>
<p>Apprently my producers partner works in New York etc etc.  I find the whole trip strange. </p>
<p>Safety was guaranteed.  I flew and traveled under diplomat status. We had no weaponized soilders or guards the whole trip.  Just locals.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Ok but disclaimer** this is graphic and I don't enjoy telling these stories so apologies in advance. </p>
<p>There are known abductions and kidnappings from the camps. But what they did in particular was raid a race of people (Yazidi) from their homes and villages on Aug 4 2014.   They killed boys over 15. And men.  And took the women as sex slaves.  The boys under 15 were forced to convert and punished when they did things that were not of their religious nature.  One woman in particular shared a story with us of having an infant and her kids and some other women locked in a basement.  And that one day the ISIS (they call them daesh) took the child by the feet and began swinging it into the ground crushing the childs skull. Killing it.   Then the young children, watching, had to witness the infant ripped apart by the legs. Cut open and then body organs were forced on the kids to be consumed.   </p>
<p>This hppened multiple times when toddlers were present.   This family eacaped their captors. The mother and her son and one of her younger daughters. The daughter seemed normal (but obviously has huge phychological problems) and the boy made two attemps from within the refugee camps to cut off the head of one of his little sisters. Twice.      The woman who told us this story had her older daughter present and her son and the baby (3ish I would guess) That the brother tried to cut its head off.   She was in a lot of pain and passed out in front of us while we were talking and listening to a translator intrepret another man.   When she woke and came to consciousness, a woman helping her up was punched right in the face by the woman who had been captive.  Then in shame she cried until we left.     </p>
<p>If necessary I could post a photo of me in a plce called Lalish but it would surely expose my identity and at the moment I am a mod at r/SorosForPrison and really dont want to be identified being that my current residence is within the belley of the beast.  Hollywood.  This town is majorly cucked and its basically me, my roommate and Kanye West (obviously exaggerated statement) who are fighting these people here where there is probably a strong connection to these people we are exposing in #Pizzagate. </p></p>

        <p><p>I know I saw that one picture somewhere. I was pretty sure it was one of the art pieces in Comet, but I could be mistaken. It may just have been on creepy JimmyComet's IG account. No clue who Kim Noble is. Her art is definitely not my cup of tea. </p></p>

        <p><p>I actually heard a while ago that Nicole Kidman had witnessed her own father perform satanic ritual abuse on other kids, including murder. When I saw that in Fiona's story, it wasn't a shock. Wasn't Nicole K. the one in the movie Eyes Wide Shut with Tom Cruise? I believe they were married at the time. </p></p>

        <p><p>Rumor has it right after Kubrick died a lot of that movie was cut out. People have speculated that he was touching on topics that powerful and connected people didn't want him to shed light on, so he was murdered to prevent that story being told in full. I hadn't thought of that in a while until I read that blog post, now I'm wondering if Kidman was feeding information about the movie. </p>
<p>Kubrick had a touch for being subtly artistic, so little things like this I've come across make me extra curious: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4w7Ley4dMI">In the final scene you see Cruz and Kidman's daughter walking off with two men as she looks back oblivious at them.</a> Those men were at the party earlier in the movie. Were they giving their daughter up to a strange oculist sex cult to be accepted? <a href="https://i.sli.mg/0h61N5.png">There's also this, which is no accident</a>.</p></p>

        <p><p>Monarch mind control is real, why do you think split personality disorder did not exist before the nazis, how do you explain the bizzare celebrity childish behavior many hollywood celebrities have been given this treatment. I used to wonder "how can someone be this way" but it makes sense when you consider there are all these traumatized enslaved zombies walking around as societal hired clappers to influence the rest.</p></p>

        <p><p>Could it be that the purpose of this is mind control? I am wondering if the children dying might be a "by product"?</p>
<p>The reason I wonder this is because disassociation seems to be a big aspect of this... why would that be the case unless mind control was involved? Unless maybe the disassociation allowed them to do things to the kids.. as if it was a type of sedative. But they could just use physical sedatives....</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm making an OP on this, but Kim Noble has multiple personalities, which can be the result of extreme trauma. Ria Pratt is the part of her personality that paints the rape/etc. scenes. Oprah did an expose on Kim and explores the personality of Ria Pratt in this clip (creepy):</p>
<p>http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Art-Therapy-and-Dissociative-Identity-Disorder-Video</p>
<p>Ria maintains that everything is real, but seems afraid of discussing it. She talks about being "zapped," by her captors. She also mentions "good sweets" and "bad sweets."</p></p>
