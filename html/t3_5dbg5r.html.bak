        <p><p>I know its not directly related to pizzagate(at least yet). And I'm not trying to derail. But i think this deserve a check aswell. There are a lot of information in these court docs it seems if we can get a hold of them. </p>
<p>And those docs listed shows that Epstein Created Clinton Global Initiative.</p>
<p>Here are a list of a few of the claims made in the soundclip (that they say are found in the court docs):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ken Starr twisting Vince Foster murder ++ into Monika ewinsky case etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Epstein being conviced (found guilty, but got plea deal) of pedophily. Actually level 3 pedophile by court meaning there is a large risk he will do it again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Epstein's butler who took the black book of Epstein to the defendant's lawyers instead of the FBI because he did not trust FBI. He got a much longer sentence than Epstein.. And then he died right after getting out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Epstein's money was given to him? Can anybody source something on this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Epstein owns the largest Residence in Manhattan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Epstein had 40 victims according to the docs between 12 and 16 years of age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Epstein said after getting out(of jail) in an interview that it was comparable to petty theft.</p>
</li>
</ul></p>

        <p><p>Interesting.  Basically, trying to get a lenient sentence in his pedo trial, he and his lawyers claimed he was involved in founding the Clinton Global Initiative. </p>
