        <strong>"Connecticut Avenue", where Comet Ping Pong and all other shops reside, has the same name as the former Witchcraft Center of New England "Connecticut"</strong>
        <p><p>Discovery stemmed from this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e2qxe/what_in_the_shit_is_this_first_ties_to_spirit/</p>
<p>Basically, John Putnam, who is connected to Podesta (asked him to introduce Obama to his intern's dying grandmother), was a historian/author on witchcraft and occult. Searched his name to find an article from 1995 about him talking about how witchcraft is still alive and real in the United States, and how Connecticut in New England was a witchcraft center.</p>
<p>Connecticut Avenue is the block where COMET PING PONG, BESTA, AND ALL OTHER SHOPS RESIDE.</p>

<p>"WITCHCRAFT is still alive in the United States," said John Putnam Demos. The statement sounds like a headline in a supermarket tabloid, and coming from Mr. Demos, a quiet-spoken and scholarly man in his late 50's, seems almost incredulous. "</p>
<p>"Excluding the more famous witch trials in Salem, Mass., Connecticut was the real witchcraft center of New England for most of the 17th century, said Mr. Demos. The first person in the New World convicted and executed for witchcraft, he said, was Alice Young of Windsor who was hanged in 1647. The first couple to be hanged for witchcraft was John and Joan Carrington, of Wethersfield, in 1651. "</p>
