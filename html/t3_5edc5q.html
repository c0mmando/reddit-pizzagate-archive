        <strong>The missing slice...</strong>
        <p><p>Why is no one talking about all of the connections Donald Trump has to the "Pizzagate" players?</p>
<p>http://www.dailywire.com/news/5556/7-things-you-need-know-about-trump-and-sex-slave-amanda-prestigiacomo</p>
<p>Maybe the lawsuit was bullshit, but these facts still stand:</p>
<p>Donald and Jeff Epstein are really good friends.</p>
<p>Donald and Hillary were really good friends.</p>
<p>Donald has an affinity for younger girls.</p></p>

        <p><p>Donald's connection to Epstein is undeniable, he did however seem to distance himself from Mr. Epstein after he got convicted unlike the others. </p></p>

        <p><p>This is the missing slice. The big picture, if you will. We are finally waking up from this propaganda state. The lies have been so extreme that when you finally understand what is really going on, you become a fanatic to get the truth out, just like Kanye (you go crazy).</p>
<p>It is global. Our politicians are controlled via blackmail no different than gangs or the mafia, lest the secrecy. They are forced to either go along with the trade off -do what Rothschild says and get unbelievable power- or simply fail in politics and/or business, or worse. Most choose the former, to enter into a tight pedophilia occult blackmail ring. Donald Trump appears to be an exception, but we will find out soon. We may have to overcome this the hard way. With a revolution. This is the content of the Julian Assange's Dead Man's Switch which has been suppressed by massive forces.</p>
<p>Hitler tried to annihilate this monolithic conspiracy. We are taught from a young age (7 years old for me) to be triggered whenever someone says Hitler. "Pure evil" immediately comes to mind.</p>
<p>The true history has been buried. Churchill, Eisenhower, and DeGualle never mentioned the holocaust in the volumes in which they recounted WWII. It would seem imparative to mention if you were an Allies general recalling the history of WWII. They would think, "If the Nazi's wouldn't have killed millions of people, potential workers and soldiers, then maybe they would have won". The Redcross report of 1948 mentioned the holocaust as a silly hoax (that's even a couple years after the war).  The holocaust and the evil of Nazi Germany was a lie, and we have been bred to hate the only people in history who have ever rebelled against this syndicate. I love Jews. Don't mistake my words for antisemitism. Jewish people are in no way to blame for any of our problems whatsoever. Hitler was absolutely wrong in this respect. However, he was correct about an "international clique" ruling our world. They do it through the grossest means imaginable.</p>
<p>If I am stupid, then none of this will make any sense and I apologize for wasting your time:</p>

        <p><p>You are right.</p>
<p>Thanks for posting this.</p>
<p>I'm starting to think any war US gets involved in it is to protect the pedo cult power structure.</p></p>

        <p><p>We will see what happens.  I have a feeling Trump will cover it up.  However, Congress can still investigate, and I have a feeling that Congress is not a big fan of Trump.  We will see, though.  We will see.  I heard that certain members of Congress are implicated as well, which means they will all cover for each other, and nothing will be done.  </p>
<p>It is up to the people to push for changes, whether the powers that be like it or not.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Until Donald J Trump updates his instagram with a picture of himself rolling around on the floor of Comet Ping Pong covered in blood wearing high heels... the chances are he's not part of this.</p>
<p>He's also got like 5 kids so he's no need to buy any.</p></p>
