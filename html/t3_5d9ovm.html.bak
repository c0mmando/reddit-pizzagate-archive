        <strong>I can't help but feel like making it public ruined all of what has been found</strong>
        <p><p>I mean, clearly this is all being discussed on a public message board... but to directly spam reviews on Comet talking about their pedo ring? To spread it all over Twitter and other social media sites? To contact their 'friends' such as Heavy Breathing?</p>
<p>If there was anything, it's going to be long gone before any real investigators get there at this point. Sure, there could be more evidence that these people are individually pedophiles that could still lock them up, I suppose, but that's no scandal really just "bad people". Everything that's been found has linked back to that singular pizza shop. And to lose that, well, I feel like we lost our biggest asset. </p></p>

        <p><p>Then you realize that there might not be an investigation because all branches of gov are implicated... </p></p>

        <p><p>When I first saw all the evidence a week ago, I was scared out of my mind, especially since there were so few of us on the board. Spreading the word has help made me feel more safe to both discuss the topic and dig for clues. With so many people doing the same, it's less likely to be singled out. </p></p>
