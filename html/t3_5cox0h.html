        <strong>How to spot and counter pizzagate shills</strong>
        <p><p>I am going to cover the basics on how to discover and spot pizzagate shills. Over the last 48 hours this investigation has blown up. The pedophiles and suspects are very scared because their whole system is about to come crashing down. They are shilling and hiring paid shills.</p>
<p>Here are some of their techniques:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ad-homonym attacks with words such as "tinfoil", "tinfoil-hat", "conspiracy theorists", "conspiracy-nuts", "Paranoid schizophrenic"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turning it into a political war "left vs right", "trump supporter", "bernie supporter"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saying the evidence is not legit but can't refute it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Telling you to leave it up to the FBI or police and stop investigating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forum sliding/Vote brigading - Making sure a post does not hit first page ( Make sure to check new/controversial from time to time )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saying this panic happened before and blaming it on "Christian nuts"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fake evidence and Fake rabbit holes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asking to make the investigation private</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is what we need to do to crush these shills:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you spot a shill, call them out. Screen shot and archive before you do. A few shills have already deleted their posts once called out. Make sure it is for sure a shill and don't dismiss something you have not looked into.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the shills feel guilty. Let them know they are supporting pedophilia, murder, and child trafficking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social engineer them and get their IP. Send them a nice payload if you have the skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Downvote the shills and upvote the people fighting the shills. Make your votes count.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to give a big thank you to everyone working on this case. You are brave soldiers working to save the children. Their lives depend on us cracking this case. Keep up the good work everyone!</p></p>

        <p><p>Note, shills will most likely call normal users shills in order to shift narrative. Be careful and decide on your own personal decision who is shill and who isn't. Trust no one but respect everyone</p></p>

        <p><p>Agreed.  Watch out for this as well and if you see shills trying to do this then help your fellow reddit researchers out.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes the political aspect definitely needs to be refuted. This should be the one issue everyone can unite for. </p>
<p>Also, like you said, I have seen comments saying "that a hoax" or "that's proven disinfo, move along" and apparently even convincing the original poster it was fake. However once I researched it there was nothing to suggest that it wasn't true. So everyone needs to find the right balance in critically evaluating everything without dismissing anything too easily or just taking someone else's word for it. </p></p>

        <p><p>I wish I could upvote this 100 times.  This is a really hard hitting technique they have been using on some of the best evidence.  They don't refute it or back up their claims.  They simply just call it hoax, fake etc.</p></p>

        <p><p>Start replying with [citation needed] or something to that effect when people proclaim "proven disinfo" without evidence.  If it's proven, it shouldn't be hard for them to hand over the proof.  Sometimes you'll even get your citation.  Sometimes "this is proven disinfo" is a legit researcher having a lazy moment, and those ones will have a citation to give you when prompted.</p></p>

        <p><p>[citation needed] is typical concern trolling tactics too.  Shills know what sources supporters are going to post.  The first call for a citation spreads doubt.  And if the citation does come (some people just move on), they have a pre-written refutation to throw at it.</p>
<p>The shills have experience and tactics and tons of research in psychology and manipulating forums on their side.</p>
<p>Edit: pinging /u/Axana since this applies to their post too.</p></p>

        <p><p>We DO have to watch out for actual disinformation (#7 on your list), though.  Effective disinformation is very hard to disprove.  It's just unsubstantiated claims, so the question isn't "can we find proof this <em>isn't</em> real," it's <strong>can we find actual verification for this.</strong>  An example from today is the claim about Scalia's throat being slit by a "rent boy" at the supposed "rent boy" ranch.  I have found nothing to support the claim, yet the post is getting upvoted rapidly.  Disinformation is MORE of a threat to us than losing a piece of evidence/connection that could potentially be real.  Disinfo is a poison pill, because if we push something with no evidence, it discredits everything else we say.</p></p>

        <p><p>At the same token, people refusing to look at the facts. If people refuse to change their mind after new/ different evidence comes to light.</p>
<p>For example, on one of the posts yesterday about the J'aime les enfants shirt, James Alefantis was at a cafe called "Les enfants" in that insta post. Someone pointed this out and got the response of "stfu still pedo"</p>
<p>I'm not saying the guy saying stfu was/is a shill, but people have to keep their imaginations in check and listen to people that may have a different viewpoint/ an explanation for some of these allegations. </p></p>

        <p><p>And a lot of times they just want to waste your time, send you looking for cite after cite after cite, pretending to misunderstand. Just bogging you down and taking you out of the game is a win for them.</p>
<p>Sometimes fun to reverse this game on them, send them down a rabbit hole generating fake proof.</p></p>

        <p><p>13 methods used to cover up rampant pedophilia and ritual abuse:</p>
<p>-Dummy up. If it’s not reported, if it’s not news, it didn’t happen.</p>
<p>-Wax indignant. This is also known as the “how dare you” gambit.</p>
<p>-Characterize the charges as “rumors” or, better yet, “wild rumors.” If, in spite of the news blackout, the public is still able to learn about the suspicious facts, it can only be through “rumors.”</p>
<p>-Knock down straw men. Deal only with the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Even better, create your own straw men. Make up wild rumors and give them lead play when you appear to debunk all the charges, real and fanciful alike.</p>
<p>-Call the skeptics names like “conspiracy theorist,” “nut,” “ranter,” “kook,” “crackpot” and, of course, “rumor monger.” You must then carefully avoid fair and open debate with any of the people you have thus maligned.</p>
<p>-Impugn motives. Attempt to marginalize the critics by suggesting strongly that they are not really interested in the truth but are simply pursuing a partisan political agenda or are out to make money.</p>
<p>-Invoke authority. Here the controlled press and the sham opposition can be very useful.</p>
<p>-Dismiss the charges as “old news.”</p>
<p>-Come half-clean. This is also known as “confession and avoidance” or “taking the limited hang-out route.” This way, you create the impression of candor and honesty while you admit only to relatively harmless, less-than-criminal “mistakes.” This stratagem often requires the embrace of a fall-back position quite different from the one originally taken.</p>
<p>-Characterize the crimes as impossibly complex and the truth as ultimately unknowable.</p>
<p>-Reason backward, using the deductive method with a vengeance. With thoroughly rigorous deduction, troublesome evidence is irrelevant. For example: We have a completely free press. If they know of evidence that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) had prior knowledge of the Oklahoma City bombing they would have reported it. They haven’t reported it, so there was no prior knowledge by the BATF. Another variation on this theme involves the likelihood of a conspiracy leaker and a press that would report it.</p>
<p>-Require the skeptics to solve the crime completely.</p>
<p>-Change the subject. This technique includes creating and/or reporting a distraction.</p></p>

        <p><p>That might just be a sort of low hanging fruit phenomena, rather than necessarily a shill.</p>
<p>For example, just yesterday there was an interview on the news with Nigel Farrage (connected to brexit) with a well known presenter, and they had this weird, unprofessional skit in the beginning about how his colleagues ate most of the pizza and left very little for him, then he went on multiple times to announce that it's national pizza day, e.t.c.</p>
<p>And of course my mind is buzzing from this. What could it mean, are they going to pizza-fy everything to scramble our efforts, what the fuck is national pizza day anyway and why would the news suddenly care, e.t.c.</p>
<p>It's such a weak link that I didn't report it, but I can see why someone might see this and want to start a thread about it</p></p>

        <p><p>Please also don't assume everyone is a shill because they disagree with you. While most of what I've seen is so fucking damning, so much so I've been sharing it to Facebook and such, some of you are legitimately jumping to some insane conclusions about things. </p>
<p>Like this one guy said "mochef" stood for molester chef. While it's possible, he considered it an irrefutable fact and the guy making insane links between the picture of someone holding a bundle of sticks being called "faggot" to fascism. He called anyone disagreeing a shill. Come the fuck on. </p>
<p>If you want to discredit the work being done here, keep posting fucking crazy conjecture. I think you could be Shilling yourself by trying to illegitimise the real links and connections.</p></p>

        <p><p>This sounds familiar, are you taking about the user LetsHackReality? I've been extremely suspicious of him since he started posting on /r/c_s_t a little while ago. Stuff that looks and feels very much like disinfo.</p></p>

        <p><p>I do believe it's the latter, good to have a corroborating opinion, thanks. He was already sliding c_s_t with a bunch of nonsense and when I saw him post here I knew it'd be trouble.</p></p>

        <p><p>The shills are also resorting to scare tactics by creating threads where the OP claims to have been followed or threatened in real life. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5co3lm/please_be_very_careful_stay_aware_of_things/?st=ivginv8v&amp;sh=5c74eb0b">Here's an example of one from earlier tonight</a> where a day-old Reddit account with no incriminating comment history claimed that they were being followed. Always check the account history of anyone claiming that they're being threatened.</p>
<p>Obviously, anyone posting incriminating stuff should take proper security measures and practice situational awareness. Don't let the shills make you grow complacent.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes I have seen they have been trying to scare us.  These people do have lots of money and connections to weapons etc though so we must be careful with our OPSEC.  If they come for me I won't hesitate to kill them in self-defense. They are involved with pedophiles and it will further prove pizzagate.  I am not afraid.  I am here to save the children.</p></p>

        <p><p>Honestly I don't think it's so much shilling as it's a bunch of people are now "contributing" to this without properly vetting their own leads. </p>
<p>Couple of weeks ago this was about DC elites.  Now it's a bunch of FUD regarding DC Hipster social media platforms. </p>
<p>I'm not trying to discredit the validity of this I'm just saying that if there is any truth to this the associates of associates of associates of people who go to Comet Pizza would not know anything of the connection to DC elites. </p>
<p>It's diversion for sure, just not sure if it's intentional. People just want to be a part of this. </p>
<p>Just a thought. </p></p>

        <p><p>A few shills can eat up a significant amount of resources.  Their goal is to spread doubt among casual users and paranoia among the more dedicated ones.  Be sure you don't spend too much time fighting these people because that's their goal.</p></p>

        <p><p>Man this is getting ridiculous. Some people do post stuff that has no connection, but If I doubt it, I'm a shill? I'm trying to be professional and get the very best evidence. People have been shit posting a lot and maybe it's to throw us off the trail. Plus people wanna remove any doubt that Trump is connected. Everyone is open! Check everything. </p>
<p>I think the best option is to look through post history. </p></p>

        <p><p>I don't know about tracing/DDossing people you assume are Shills, I can see a lot of innocent people get caught in the crossfire.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's good to be cynical about somethings to not go down some unrelated rabbit hole.</p></p>

        <p><p>Wikileaks emails show podesta (ultra powerful Washington guy) using potential code for pedophilia, etc. This was spurred by the creepy spirit cooking and other art that the podestas are connected to. They also have a lot of connections to child refugees as well as having connections to persecuted pedophiles as well as users on their business(comet pizza) on Instagram having pedophilic and also occult imagery.</p>
<p>Nothing is necessarily proven, but there is an insane amount of coincidental evidence as well as a strange amount of artists that depict satanic imagery and pedophilic imagery</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah it's really fucking weird but we've seen crazier. There's a lot of elite pedophiles that were exposed in England recently so it makes it even more plausible. </p></p>

        <p><p>Shills are only as effective as you are brainwashed. We grow up with condescending authoritative figures, berating us into their model of conformity. All the shill has to do is play on this to get an emotional response from us. What people don't realize is that they are being baited into self censorship by hacking our emotions. The truth is every human has agency i.e. The power of choice. You are in charge, you must decide the facts for yourself. There are no experts, there is only you.</p></p>

        <p><p>ALSO--if you are on a new lead not yet discovered, they tell you you are going off topic and to stay on the original topic, stop wasting people's time with a new lead. If they start peppering a thread with that, you know you are on a potentially real lead.</p></p>

        <p><p>Relating to #6 - I've also noticed them specifically referencing 'Satanic Panic' as a diversion tactic.</p>
<p>As if to say, the overly critical views of D&amp;D or heavy metal of the 80's in reference to 'satanism' has some bearing on debunking actual ritualistic pedophilia and murder happening today.</p></p>

        <p><p>The correct procedure to use with shills is to use the report button. There's no point in responding to them if you suspect them.</p>
<p>We don't need interboard hostility and we do not need to be doxing each other, so please remove those suggestions from your post.</p></p>
