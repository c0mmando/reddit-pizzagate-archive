        <strong>I just want to say I love everyone here on this sub + 4chan investigating these pedophilia operations & thank you so much for doing it. It's entirely volunteer work and I'm guessing it's extremely sickening. üíù</strong>

        <p><p>If you'd like to share details on the rituals and abuse, please do (with personally identifiable details omitted of
course). I believe now is a time when peoples' eyes and ears are more open than ever.  Most people are not aware that things like this actually happen irl and first-hand accounts are extremely informative. </p></p>

        <p><p>i've been trying to post here and there some information related to occult practices in general which i see many people not wanting to mess with that side of it and i keep saying "it's THE WHOLE reason they do this stuff."</p>
<p>Personal memories are hard. I'm dissociatve so i have to get myself in a reasonably stable minded way to start talking about that. Even some imagery and discussion on this thing has been rough but i just Can't sit this out. I will try to share as i can.</p>
<p>Its as bad, probably worse than most really imagine. With r/a, sexual abuse isn't just flatout sexual abuse it's the very most sadistic forms of that. Don't know how else to say it without being very graphic. I strongly suspect some of my childhood friends were killed though i can't prove it.</p>
<p>They use everything to break kids minds - starvation, isolation, beatings, rapings, being forced to watch really horrible things that would damage an adult let alone a child. At the end of the day the breaking apart is what saves you. You just box up those killer memories and a different "you" deals with it while you forget and are able to somehow go on without being consciously aware for years and years. Some probably never recover memories.</p>
<p>So, i'm just one part of "me". This me is distant from the trauma. I'm the one who functions like a relatively normal person. I have parts that are very skilled in ritual knowledge but i only have some of those details available to this "me" consciously at the moment. It's easier for me to ask them specific questions than it is to get one of these alters to voluntarily come forward.</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree it's important for us to speak up and thank you for doing so. It's not easy because "speaking up" just goes against everything drilled into us. I know there are many just too scared to do so. It's understandable because it's no joke that some have lost their lives for trying.</p>
<p>I've thought about taking this (very carefully) to the DID sub which i used to post to on another account but it's very triggering information and coming up with a good way to do it isn't easy.</p>
<p>For our friends we lost and all the kids who are trapped in this mess now i hope with all my heart that we can see justice done.</p></p>

        <p><p>Maybe trying a thread with a trigger warning addressed to anyone who is aware they were ritually abused or abused by a high profile group of people. A sucinct summary of what's going on here and a plea for anyone who can speak up to do so. It's hard to make anyone feel safe who just doesn't, but telling them that they can and should remain anonymous and only to be as involved as they can manage to be might help. The more who are willing to say something the safer everyone is.</p></p>

        <p><p>Thank you for your kind words. Yes, i'm a Christian now and that keeps me focused on the fact that this world is temporary and these guys will ultimately get what's coming to them. That's really the only justice i ever expected, so seeing this happen here is really amazing to me.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah for me, violence, manipulation, and rape were all hand in hand. It made you so confused because you never knew what was going on or happening. I have a hard time with memories too...sometimes I even doubt the things I do remember...even normal everyday memories I doubt. Shit has really fucked me up more than I realize but the good news is that I'm getting treatment now. Hopefully that will help me sort shit out.</p></p>

        <p><p>I know what you mean, sorting through memories is like figuring out what was a nightmare and what was real. One thing i've come to accept, though is that when you have an alter/alters who constantly relive something or insist upon its reality, its time to listen. Making you doubt your memories is part of the manipulation.</p></p>

        <p><p>Someone tried to kidnap me near my home in 1993/1994 (was around 12yo). They chased me around the block and slow rolled in front of my house and circled back around all the while I was home alone. They left but I saw the same van ride on several other occasions following which ended. At the time I didn't think it was a potential kidnapping but more of someone who knew it was me that slipped a lit pack (100) of blackcats through the mail slot of their front door at 3am on a Monday morning. </p>
<p>But looking back in of now, it was a sketchy guy in a beat up baby blue windowless van that may have been trying to kidnap me for pedo-sex ring ran and operated by the global higher ups.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, these poor guys see the very worst shit there is man. It makes sense that they would get pretty traumatized. Dont want to imagine what some of these dudes have seen or heard, remember, its not just still images, some of it is high def video in a well lit room with great audio equipment, surely, if it's to be distributed. So it cant be something that wouldnt fuck anybody up</p></p>

        <p><p>I love all of you as well. I literally just watch the subscriber numbers tick up as if I am watching a scoreboard between good and evil. Every single time I refresh I get a happy feeling that people out there won't stand for this shit. That might sound weird, but the last 3 weeks have been nothing but darkness and sadness for me. This subs rapid growth has helped me cling on to hope.</p></p>

        <p><p>I joined reddit for the first time yesterday, specifically to help with this case and to see if there maybe a connection to a friend of mine's case out of Australia whose sister was abducted and her organs were harvested while she was on a trip to Peru. I may or may not make the connection, but I cant leave any stone unturned. It most certainly takes a special kind of person to do this job. This has got to be the most emotionally, mentally and spiritually taxing endeavor I've taken on.</p></p>

        <p><p>Some folks suspect they get a big news story going (Trump wins!) and then drop a huge indecipherable clump of info at the same time while most people are distracted. Then, the few people remaining who are paying attention to the dump and wading through this gigantic amount of data, when they find something and post it, most people don't notice, because they're still upset or energized about the distraction piece (Pizzagate? What? NOT MY PRESIDENT! DUMP TRUMP! RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE! TURKA JURBS!)</p></p>

        <p><p>That site looks like a collection of links to archives of FOIA request responses, a lot of it from the 1960s, probably not related to pizzagate unless some random tidbit happens to be buried in there somewhere.</p></p>

        <p><p>Can anyone with facebook go to the page for "heavy breathing " it's majestic apes band. I feel like she will be the week link. We should bring awareness to her fans about what's really going on. She posted her response  to all of this and is getting hit hard. Can we get some "just confess and you will get a deal" comments?</p></p>

        <p><p>Most criminals are careful not to generate any direct evidence while they are committing a crime. Because of this, courts often depend on circumstantial evidence to determine the facts of the case.</p>
<p>Keep that in mind guys, even thou alot of the evidence we find is circumstantial it will help in the end! All of us across the globe should be proud.</p></p>

        <p><p>To r/a survivors:</p>
<p>I have a podcast and if it would be of service to this effort, or even just helpful to talk about it, I will gladly dedicate an episode to r/a survivor stories and do what I can to spread the information. I'm so sorry for what has been endured, without even having scratched the surface of the horror. Thank you all for speaking up.</p></p>
