        <p><p>When they call pizzagate a rabbit hole, they sure as hell mean it. I'm new here and trying to catch on. Is cannibalism a thing among CTRs or pedophilia? Have children been missing? Any missing children reports in proximity to Comet? It's suspected Clinton has had pneumonia, right? Good god there is so much to read. Sorry to inundate with questions </p></p>

        <p><ol>
<li>Is cannibalism a thing among CTRs or pedophilia?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>We think they ritual sacrifice the children. Definitely a lot of pedophilia going on. Definitely blood drinking. Spirit Cooking as they say.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Have children been missing? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Yes. Look into Madeline McCann. The mug shots for suspects match up almost exact to John Podesta and his brother. This case went unsolved. They just stopped investigating.</strong></p>
<p>3.Any missing children reports in proximity to Comet? </p>
<p><strong>Help us look into it. I would assume so</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It's suspected Clinton has had pneumonia, right?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Anons now think is is most likely Kuru, gotten from cannibalism from infected brain tissue ( serious )</strong></p>
<p>Good god there is so much to read. Sorry to inundate with questions ...</p>
<p><strong>It will be an eye opener. You will probably have some strange emotions. Better everyone found out now than this shit just keep going on.</strong></p></p>

        <p><p>If you google the symptoms I'm sure you can come up with a few hundred things she may have. I had something like this on the roof of my mouth for a month. Never figured out what it was, but as far as I know I never consumed human flesh so...</p>
<p>The gait and tremors could just be age.</p>
<p>From what I have read before, I believe Kuru is linked mostly to eating brains, especially that of your own community. I believe the reason it was more widespread in those tribes was because it was generations eating cannibals who ate cannibals, allowing for prions to mutate more. At least, that is my understanding of it. </p></p>
