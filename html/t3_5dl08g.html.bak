        <p><p>Well the delicious "pizza" they love to talk about so much isn't the kind you ordered. The place is a front for child pedophilia/child trafficking, what on earth made you think the food would be any good and why would you eat it in the first place?</p></p>

        <p><p>You should have asked to use their bathroom. Then if they have one, give it a good inspection, then leave. If not just leave. No need to order from that disgusting place.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well I'm not going to pretend to be a law expert, but where I live I've seen it from time to time. If you have ever seen the show "Pawn Stars", a lot of the time in the background of the office area you can see a sign that says "No Public Restroom".</p>
<p>Is that place claiming to be family/kid friendly like Comet is? Because if that was the case, then I would find it to be suspicious.</p></p>

        <p><p>Once it came out that their logo looked suspiciously similar to a known pedo symbol they edited the logo on their website. </p>
<p>My comment was pointing fun at the fact that they didn't update their sign. </p>

        <p><p>how is it being closed during the day suspicious? It would be more suspicious if it was open. There's no point employing staff to stand around if there is no business. </p></p>

        <p><p>I would assume a shitty pizza place would be open for lunch.  Pizza's cost like 55 cents for the actual materials and you'd just need a chef and a register person if there is slow business and you'd still make money if anyone came in. If they got 10 customers a day before 5 oclock they'd be able to cover their operating costs.  It just seems strange to me.</p>
<p>edit: apparently it may not be unusual for restaurants in the neighborhood not to open until dinner time. this is likely completely irreverent.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Minimum wage is $9.50 per hour. </p>
<p>Comet is a big place they would employ more than 2 people, there would be at least a manager on too. </p>
<p>And it's not just "actual materials" it shows me how ignorant you are to the restaurant trade, you have to prep food for the coming day/week which means inevitably you will throw food away and then putting costs up. by only being open late it means you are only prepping for what you need.</p></p>

        <p><p>There is nothing weird about that. Down the street there are a bunch of restaurants in Celvand park and Woodley Park area that don't open till later in the afternoon like Spices or Medium Rare or Indique even in downtown there are lots of restaurants that are only open for dinner service so there is nothing "weird" about a late afternoon opening when lots of other places do the same in the city.</p></p>

<p>Pizza's cost like 55 cents for the actual materials </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope you mean per slice. A decent pizza (whole pizza) certainly costs more than 55 cents to make. A whole pie might have half a pound or more of cheese on it, that's a couple bucks right there.</p></p>

        <p><p>yeah, one slice of pizza at a shitty hole in the wall pizza place probably doesn't have the worlds finest ingredients.  But even then, after taking a deep breath and backing away from this rabbit hole for  a sec. coming back with fresh eyes and a clean mind makes it seem like not being open until after dinner is likely completely unrelated .... unless the whole thing is a front for something so they don't care about the revenue and just need it to exist but don't want to spend a lot of effort on it. But again, wild speculations with no basis of fact here. </p></p>

        <p><p>I have found it, will report soon if anything suspicious shows up on the episode.</p>
<p><em>EDIT</em> Okay, so there are some big differences from OP's pictures and how the restaurant looked when the episode of Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives (Season 9, EP 9) aired June 28, 2010. We can probably assume this was filmed earlier that year.</p>
<p><a href="https://puu.sh/smFOk/991cffeea1.jpg">Picture of replaced artwork on left wall</a>
Compare to OP's picture, these have all been removed.</p>
<p><a href="https://puu.sh/smE30/f0fe26cacb.jpg">Close up of a few of the photos in the collage</a>
No idea who the people in the photos are, the only clear one is the very top left of the screen shot of a white lady and an young Asian girl. Again, this is not to accuse anyone, I'm just pointing out changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://puu.sh/smEK5/df978e7019.jpg">Exterior of the restaurant at time of filming</a></p>
<p><a href="https://puu.sh/smF63/592affde45.jpg">More exterior of restaurant</a></p>
<p><a href="https://puu.sh/smFCu/bfb1651718.jpg">Close up of sign, something written in black on it, differs from OP's picture</a></p>
<p><a href="https://puu.sh/smF95/ab54bb6bbe.jpg">Back room with two ping pong tables and a podium with speakers</a></p>
<p>Take all of this with a bottle of salt, I just wanted to post then vs. now pictures to spur more thought and discussion. There is a very good chance this changes nothing and I am okay with that. I will keep digging, and hopefully everyone else keeps digging as well!</p></p>

        <p><p>Apparently, Class C liquor license renewal for restaurants in DC was required before <a href="http://abra.dc.gov/release/more-half-all-district-abc-licenses-due-renewal-march-31">March 31</a>. They are issued a <a href="http://abra.dc.gov/node/1132277">placard</a> which can be contested within 45 days. Strange that they still have it up. Maybe it was contested for some reason. </p>
<p>Were they serving alcohol? </p></p>

        <p><p>This is probably nothing ...But after I heard of tunnels and stuff under these places --coincidentally, 1st I heard of this was in Jimmy Commet's own statement to defend himself. Anyway , I decided to look up a map of DC metro subway w/ the streets overlayed. Both Comet and Besta are on Connecticut ave...there's a  subway tunnel directly under much of Connecticut avenue. It goes essentially from the capitol ...directly under Connecticut ave...until a block or so from Comet pp. The subway makes a quick sharp left then a right shifts one block to the west) and then back on the same North West track.  My thought was that if that subway tunnel extended 1 block it would be directly under Comet PP...Any chance they originally built further (extending under comet) then for some reason backtracked a bit and re-oriented the subway slightly to the left/west...this would leave empty/un-used subway tunnels right below them.<br>
MAP&gt;&gt;  https://www.wcl.american.edu/admiss/images/audcmap_big.png
Comet is 1 block north of "VEN NESS" and directly under the 's' in Friendship Heights.</p></p>
