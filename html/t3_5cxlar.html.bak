        <strong>A word of advice regarding the level of evil that we are dealing with. Love is our weapon!</strong>
        <p><p>I'm a frequent contributor (with some well-received posts discussing the current awakening that we are experiencing). However, I'm using an old novelty account, created for the purpose of sharing my paranormal and high strangeness encounters. I'm fairly certain that I've been subjected to something that could be related to MK ULTRA.</p>
<p>Now, before you read my history and write me off as some tinfoil hat kook; please take a moment to consider the recent paradigm shifts that have been popping up in these posts and threads. Being quite a bit older, I'm not up on all the lingo and slang that I see being used; but I have seen a lot of talk about "Meme Magic". If I understand it, correctly it's a form a self-fulfilling prophecy that results from groups of people creating ideas to be manifested by sharing in the form of memes? Please correct me if this isn't right.</p>
<p>In occult circles, this might be considered "White Magic". Correct me here, as well; because I'm not especially well versed in magic or "magick" of any sort. What I do know is that those who practice it have a strong belief that it works. And whether the results are due to actual paranormal entities or simply the psychological effects of mind control, is not especially relevant. One way or another, it works. </p>
<p>I can see that it's having a serious effect on the collective psyche, by the number of comments talking about returning to religion. This is some terrifying stuff, and so many paradigms have been shattered that we are more easily opened up to the idea that higher powers may be at work. Whether it's purely psychological or truly paranormal; I urge all of you to take protective measures. I keep a reflective bubble around myself, my loved ones and my home. Under meditation, I visualize a silver bubble that originates in my heart and expands to surround all that matters to me. If I'm alone, or in another location, I carry my personal bubble with me. It's a one-way mirror that allows me to travel about, spiritually and through lucid dreams, while remaining invisible to dangerous entities.</p>
<p>Because of the extreme level of outright evil that these revelations have stirred up in my daily life, I believe that my bubble began to tarnish. Last night I stayed away from my home, and alone. I experienced a night terror of a man laying atop me and attempting to hold me down. I quickly realized that this was no simple romantic dream and that I was reliving the childhood memories of sexual abuse (although it was never as extreme as this dream was about to become). Either it was a real demonic visitation, or I was having a vivid, lucid dream; because I instantly realized that my bubble needed to be reinforced.</p>
<p>I quickly put myself into the meditative state and rebuilt my bubble. The being resisted and tried to crush it. A violent battle ensued and I ended up calling on Jesus Christ to protect me. I'm not religious, but I was raised in the Christian faith; so that's what comes naturally to me. If that isn't weird enough, the Jesus figure appeared and told me that I only needed to send out love. "Love?! Are you kidding? This is the devil!" All the while, this thing is trying to hold me down. Finally, I tried it. I thought of all the people I love and sent out the feelings of love that I have for them, directed at this demon. As though doused in acid, it was repulsed and instantly vanished. I carefully rebuilt an extra-strong bubble and sent some out to my loved ones, as well.</p>
<p>I'm sharing this because never have I been associated with such a powerful coalition of people, as yourselves, who are fighting the ultimate battle of good vs. evil. These perpetrators have all sense of goodness either traumatized out of them or locked away in an impenetrable compartment (I believe by way of mind control). They are not only a great threat to their physical victims, but to the collective unconsciousness. We know that they can find out who we are and where we are; and that they love to murder for sport and vengeance. We are poking a terrifying hornet's nest. So, please, take some time to learn or refresh your meditation skills and find some way to protect your unconscious self from attacks by these demons. </p>
<p>Ultimately, we need to send out as much love as we can muster into the Universe. Take time to step away from the good work that you all are doing and generate loving thoughts towards them. They feed on evil, and it starves them! </p>
<p>TLDR; LOVE!</p></p>

        <p><p>This is wonderful! I also built a bubble as a kid, but it came from a Bible lesson on Spiritual Armor. I found the armor hard to sleep in, it made the Dark seem too close. And so it came to be a bubble, for me. 
I too extended to my home and now more recently to my Street, that has been pleasantly civil for a good while now.
It wasn't until that point, that I felt reassured enough to look to the larger energic landscape around me.
While Gardening I began to hear about the state of the country and current Spiritual aspects. 
Whether or not you lable the Extremes, we are at war. Some make war. Some live near it.
It's time to end war for awhile and let healing come to most of the World.
Consider it all energy: Creative/Destructive
That's gardenknowledge 101
It's time again for Renaissance
But I digress: OP (original poster) your mental construct is very Creative!
One peice of data for you: The 20th of January is Saint Agnes Eve, the patron saint of Virgins
But it is also: Grand Climax (blood ritual) in Satanic calender: Conjuration of Talal, a warrior Demon.
This fact is statistical data from victums of ritual abuse, compiled by survivorship.org.
Everyone: whether you believe or not is irrlevent,
THEY DO.
That's why even as painfully shy as I, a triple Earth Sign can be, I am activated to stand against Destruction!</p></p>

        <p><p>I find this very interesting. I, too, am older and have always been an empath. I can definitely feel the energy of change around me now and sense that this is much, much more than the simple investigation it started out to be. I also had an episode of sleep paralysis last week, trying to fight off the demon that was lying on top of me, holding me down. I haven't had one of these in over a year and felt that it was probably caused by the horrific things that I've been reading here. I have no history of childhood sexual abuse. This scenario is typical of a night paralysis episode. If this is happening to you, research it. Anyone who has lucid dreams is probably more inclined to experience this. I am very careful to never read horror novels or watch disturbing movies. I stopped watching tv completely over three years ago. I make every effort to protect myself spiritually. I never sleep on my left side because that tends to make sleep paralysis occur more often. We all need to take time to take care of ourselves as we engage in this epic battle.</p></p>

        <p><p>Wow. It's strange to hear how many other people, here, have had recent experiences. I do believe that the energy surrounding this stuff is the most evil of evil; and quite dangerous to humanity as a whole. Hope you are OK!</p>
<p>I am certainly an empath, too. I cannot watch portrayals violence or medical procedures which inflict pain; and cannot even tolerate loud noises or flashing lights.</p>
<p>Sleep paralysis theory is a bit of a chicken or egg question, in my opinion. The scientific explanations, that I've read, don't really answer it for me. I am able to lucid dream by laying on my back, with my head tilted back on the pillow. This position also causes pressure on nerves which give me numbness in my neck or shoulders. My guess is that something about that position is causing a neurological reaction. Now, is that responsible for the experience or is it just a correlation? I couldn't say.</p>
<p>I've had dozens, if not over one hundred, episodes of sleep paralysis, night terrors and/or waking dreams throughout my lifetime. I cannot make any connection to my sleep position. However, I am able to make clear connections to locations and/or surrounding circumstances. The one mentioned in my original post is the second, time in recent years, that I had the experience of someone on top of me. Both times, it was when I was face-down, and both times in a different bed, while sleeping alone. I typically sleep on my stomach with pillows propping me up so that my weight is on my left side. I have sleep apnea and cannot breathe properly on my back. My husband is constantly turning me in my sleep because of snoring or choking. Yet, I do not experience sleep paralysis during these times. In recent years my episodes of sleep paralysis have waned to the point of two or three per year.</p>
<p>The most recent event, before the one in this post, was a visitation from a friend on the night he passed away. I was able to link the experience to something his family described him doing before his death, and to something he joked about doing, in a message, years prior (which I had completely forgotten about).</p>
<p>The majority of events centered around my abduction experiences (mostly during childhood), and the others were almost always in places that turned out to be haunted or in a negative environment. The night that this demon figure tried to attack me, the people in the house had engaged in a hostile verbal exchange; which filled the house with negativity. I also learned that someone has built a strange altar on the property; which looks Wiccan to my untrained eye. I believe that these circumstances opened the door for this negative presence to visit me.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that (although sleep paralysis can be recreated in a controlled environment) it does not have a single answer. We can't know if the controlled experiments are creating the hallucinations, or if the hallucinations are triggered memories from actual experiences. It's like saying that we can induce a seizure in epileptics with flashing lights, therefore all seizures are caused by flashing lights. I think that's just bad science; and that's why I don't argue too much with people who think they have it all figured out.</p>
<p>Stay safe!</p></p>

        <p><p>As a non-believer in magick, I agree that we need to send love. We cannot risk appearing as hateful people. We must send out a message that we are genuinely concerned for the well-being of children. The media has portrayed Pizzagate's predecessors (GamerGate, Anti-Clinton) as hateful movements with far-right agendas. There's too much at stake for us to let it happen with Pizzagate.</p></p>
