        <strong>We'll have to take matters into our own hands now -- Clinton regime just shut down the NYPD investigation, NYPD forced to hand over all evidence to FBI in Washington. Case is "terminated."</strong>

<p>And so it begins. They fully intend to get away with everything they've done. </p>
<p>We can't depend on a surprise leak anymore. It's completely up to us. </p>

        <p><p>Come on, don't be na√Øve. This stuff goes back decades if not centuries.  you really think Trump would've gotten into the position that he has without knowing anything? Don't trust any current leadership. I fully believe the only recourse at this point is mass upheaval  of the system by the people.  Those in the know with direct evidence have to come forward in spite of any risk of consequences. They will do that if they have huge numbers of people backing them up . People like Assange, Snowden etc but more directly connected to the inside.  More and more people need to wake the F up and get angry.  there is strength and power in numbers , which is why these elite have tried so hard to control the population. </p></p>

        <p><p>I wouldn't rule out the idea of Marshall Law in an event such as that. Domestic terrorism as of two years ago was the number one threat to our national security. It has to be broken from the inside so we're not to be turned in to dust. Even if it is from public notoriety, it has to go through internal systems to be validated and for those responsible to reap their consequences. And reap they must. It just has to be calculated. We're talking people who knocked down three fucking skyscrapers in front of everyone and got away with it because of their media power. And by all means, this isn't an effort of hinderence by individual investigators. Take the sick fucks down. Just don't get dusted for going about it poorly. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, I don't think people realize how established this is. This goes back 100s of years as the elites shift around the globe. These networks and connections just pass on from generation to generation. </p>
<p>I heard a good talk of a very wealthy powerful Turkish family who span all over the globe. They started out hundreds of years ago as bandits but now are the go to family for high level assassinations (elites, state actors, etc). These people exist within a different elite world that exists on a different level. They make mountains of money which is siphoned from the state and hidden in the dark banking sector under complex tricks, making it nearly impossible to track down that they own it. </p></p>

        <p><p>Back in 94(I think) Trump was accused of tying up and raping a 13 year old girl who no one believes. Looking into that case, some of the same bigname pedos were shown to have a connection to Trump and they're obviously involved with the clintons too. If Trump isn't involved in the same pedo ring we're investigating now, it's more likely than of he's in a similar group for the GOP. </p></p>

        <p><p>It wouldn't be surprising if Trump was involved in the same sort of stuff, whether directly in this pizza gate ring or in a similar group that does similar sorta shit. He's the president of the United States and he was close friends with the Clintons prior to the campaign starting. People who found this from r/the_donald need to keep their minds open. This is about the children and not party lines. The people who do this shit should be exposed and punished. </p></p>

        <p><p>Trump isn't going to get assassinated. If there are people pulling the strings, that would show their hand and create revolution against the government because we wouldn't be able to trust them anymore.</p>
<p>Trump will be fine.</p>
<p>I still take everything with a massive bunch of salt.</p></p>

        <p><p>You just gave me an idea for a homemade yard sign. On one side it says "Conspiracy of Silence, #pizzagate" and on the other side, "Franklin scandal cover up, #pizzagate." That should make my neighbors curious enough to look it up. </p></p>
