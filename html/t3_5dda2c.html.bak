        <strong>Coverup - DCUrbanMom.com</strong>
        <p><p>Long time listener, first time caller.  This is the community website whose epicentre is the DC subculture: www.dcurbanmom.com</p>
<p>There was an existing thread on Pizzagate which had burned itself out...until I posted a Podesta/e-Fit meme.</p>
<p>Even though I am using Tor, they have blocked me and deleted my multiple posts with links.  I'm not an expert on infosec, but I'm gonna guess it isn't a good idea at this point to visit the site from Chrome.</p>
<p>Fairfax Underground has long harassed these feckless, urban dwellers.  Now they have gone full on CENSORED after I added a few links to an old post.  I have screen caps of my posts, now removed.</p>

        <p><p>Can you take a look at https://np.reddit.com/r/technicalFNaF/ this subreddit for me and tell me if you think it looks fucked up?</p>
<p>Like read the sidebar with the rules about copying the code or what not? Its almost seems like they are hiding CP in there or who knows what.</p></p>

        <p><p>There were some post which very quickly were deleted.  Try posting something with referenced subject in the "off-topic" section and see how quickly they disappear.</p></p>

        <p><p>Effing hell.  Did I pick up a CTR already?  Need some investigative assistance here.  Not a cyber security expert.  Probe this site.  Make a post.  See what happens...</p></p>

        <p><p>This site bears further investigation.  I found the post via this search:</p>
<p>http://www.dcurbanmom.com/jforum/jforum.page?module=search&amp;action=search&amp;search_keywords=walnut+pizza&amp;match_type=all&amp;search_forum=&amp;sort_by=relevance</p>
<p>It won't let you even look at the post without having a log in account (free).  All the other messages you can see over a VPN.</p>
<p>My guess is, knowing this region well, is that there is probably a fair amount of info on this site as most of its users live within 10 miles of the epicenter - Comet Ping Pong.  Many probably even closer.</p>
<p>The owner/mods of the site may be connected somehow.  Think about that - involved in CP and you run a comprehensive site called "DC Urban Mom".</p></p>
