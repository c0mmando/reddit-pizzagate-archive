        <strong>Can somebody help me find this information on the Pizza places logo designers..</strong>
        <p><p>Okay so basically this may be slightly confusing, but I hope anybody who's seen what I'm looking for will remember and be able to link it on this post.</p>
<p>Recently on a post about the FBI pedophile symbols, somebody suggested that the reason all these logos of pizza places and restaurants in close proximity have this pedo symbolism could be because of the designer. Somebody then did some research and went further, and found a 'mother' company of some sort related either to the logo designing or some tech stuff, had an entitrely normal, non-food related website.. and then in the 'about' section, said something about "makes a mean cheese pizza :)", which was very misplaced. </p>
<p>I've been trying really hard to find this again as it was a comment on a not very popular post, so is definitely burried. I want a link to this same website with the description, or a link to this 'about' section that mentioned pizza.</p>
<p>Please post here if you know what I'm talking about. Thank you</p></p>

        <p><p>It needs to be found. It was a day or two after the election and nobody has posted the information since. </p></p>
