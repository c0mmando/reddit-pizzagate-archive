<p><strong>Big Planet Comic Book Store (0:42):</strong> Inconvenient, hard to find, in with another shop, really small, large selection of comics, "Diary Of A Wimpy Kid", poorly placed...<em>NOTICE HOW HE GETS AGGRAVATED AT "CHRIS" AT THE END OF THE VIDEO!</em> </p>
<p><strong>Uptown Movie Theater (0:52):</strong> Near Cleveland Park Metro, good for after/before the zoo, one big screen, different types of movies, newest film, balcony, look down on screen <em>NOTICE HOW HE IS NERVOUS AND ANXIOUS</em></p>
<p><strong>Indique Restaurant (0:42):</strong> Near Cleveland Park Metro, near zoo, chicken curry, naan, good rice, spices</p>

        <p><p>Eli is a minor, and as such you documenting a 'supposed' link to this puts him, and any other kid in risk of pedophilia activity. It's the context, the link only you have made. If any of the kids become a victim after posts have been made, the poster, the moderators, and Reddit have culpability in that criminal activity because Reddit is a public space. In other words, there could be litigation or even jail time (what if a poster is using the Reddit community to ID these kids, and then seeks them out as 'easy targets?')</p></p>
