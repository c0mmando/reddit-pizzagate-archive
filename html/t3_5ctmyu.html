        <strong>I have a theory on the "pizza-related map".</strong>
        <p><p>Well, I'm probably gonna be the most disliked person on this sub-reddit. But, I believe I have figured out the one email which confused me the most and has yet to be figured out. </p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795</p>
<p>What is a pizza map? I've heard the theories, I've obsessed over it. I've figured it out.</p>
<p>http://www.thefreedictionary.com/map / http://dictionary.infoplease.com/map 
http://onlineslangdictionary.com/meaning-definition-of/map
http://lingomash.com/slang-meanings/73882/slang-meaning-of-map
http://www.dictionary.com/browse/map
http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/map</p>
<p><strong>Map = 5. a slang word for face</strong></p>
<p>http://www.thefreedictionary.com/face</p>
<p><strong>face = 9. The most significant or prominent surface of an object, especially:  e. The right side, as of fabric.</strong></p>
<p>Now read the email again.</p>
<p>The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related)</p>
<p>"The realtor found a handkerchief (I think the surface seems pizza related. Is it yours?"</p>

        <p><p>probably because they're all posted by me. Cos I'm debunking this Pizzagate thing and I know how defensive people can get. But I want people to see these, and make their own mind up. Thus, not wanting mass downvotes.</p></p>

</blockquote>
<p>How about instead of debunking being the focus, you offer up some critical thinking like you did in this post. Bring your thoughts, be respectful and you're doing the right thing.</p>
<p>If you get way way off the beaten path a bunch of times. Well... then you will start to lose some credibility.</p>
<p>But for a moment let us assume that what you brought here opened all of our eyes and you explained this one sentence in the email. How would you begin to explain all of these other correlations? I'm genuinely curious. Your answer will help me to see if you're really looking for the truth or desperate for all of this research to go away.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not desperate for the research to go away.
I was part of the research, I was even a mod on this subreddit till I resigned.</p>
<p>But the more I researched the more I realized, actually, the whole basis of pizzagate is built on very flimsy ground. I also noticed less people interested in finding the truth, and more so looking for stupid shit like...a spiral on a logo. Or every triangle is now a pedo symbol, someone was even trying to link PizzaHut with it. It's become the typical conspiracy crap, attracting the usual crowd who think EVERYTHING is a conspiracy.</p>
<p>That's what has happened. </p>
<p>If anything, I'm not dismissing the entire theory. But I honestly believe John Podesta is innocent. The ONLY person of suspicion left at this point is the owner of PingPongPizza. </p>

        <p><p>Those first instances. Pizza hut and pedo symbol hunt, were shills trying to discredit.
If we don't investigate podesta, then Jimmy will take the fall for him, the same way podesta and huma would take the fall for Hillary if we investigated them.</p></p>

        <p><p>They're not shills, just conspiracy theory enthusiasts. 
I'm not a shill, I don't think there are any shills.</p>
<p>There are:
1) Conspiracy fans
2) Random people who hear about the theory and post here for a laugh
3) Actual people researching it</p></p>

<p>There is some truth to that. Don't you feel that should be part of the process though? We have uncovered some very odd things hiding out in plain sight. This whole process is akin to sifting soil through multiple layers of screens. There will be some nuggets, there will be some useless dirt. But if we just stop because one load of soil doesn't produce a nugget then we're left with nothing. I can assure you we are not stopping.</p>
<p>Seems like you want to discredit the entire movement because you disagree with some of the processes. That's a shame and I feel that will put you you on the opposite end of the spectrum of people who see one thing and try to draw lines and make ridiculous associations where they simply don't exist.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be better for you to do more research in private and come forward with the <em>really</em> concrete stuff?</p></p>

<p>I've felt like this so many times.</p>
<p>Then I remember that Beau Biden, as the Delaware state Attorney General, defended the position of a judge to let the dupont fortune heir and admitted child molester off with probation, after he admitted to sexual interaction with his 3 year old daughter. - https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cmejk/in_2014_delaware_ag_beau_biden_son_of_vp_biden/</p>
<p>I remember that our secret service was implicated with prostitutes down in Columbia, which also implicated the son of a very close friend of Podesta, who was relieved of any wrongdoing. - https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cmhqu/the_dach_link/</p>
<p>I remember that the likes of Clinton et al are friends with convicted pederast with a slap on the wrist, Jeffery Epstein. And that Clinton and Podesta keep other very shady individuals as close company.</p>
<p>These together remind me that something strange is going on at the top end of our elite class of people, where they can get away with whatever they want.</p>
<p>I remember that Sasha Lord, associate of James Alefantis/Comet Ping Pong, has contracted and accepted rather deliberate artwork depicting child sex abuse rituals. And that Sasha Lord has the close associate of Heavy Breathing who sings rather deliberately about pedophilia. And that the bar tender and Alefantis have shared numerous rather curiously strange sexually deviant and suggestive images featuring pizza across instagram. All of this while maintaining that Comet Ping Pong is a family friendly location.</p>
<p>Now, this could just be an enormous fuckup on all our parts and an amazing string of coincidences. Or these could all be linked and we just havent quite connected all the dots, even though we know that all involved are associates of one another.</p></p>

        <p><p>Feckin research as in using freedictionary.com. lol you are a true Sherlock Holmes. What I imagine, which of course is anxiety driven consipiracy, is that someone added onto the website, map to mean face, so that map could therefore = design on hankercheif. In order to cover their ass and refute our claims through the same method you just used.
Of course everyone here is jumping to conclusions, but that's the point, without our claims, people like you would just keep burying the cause.</p>
<p>Edit: added comma and an s to ass</p></p>

<p>Have you ever heard of someone use the word map to mean, semen/sweat to trace you of pedophilic crimes whilst viewing a house? No, that's baseless theory.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, the context of these emails. They are looking at houses. More specifically, vacation rentals (look at the URLs of each place they visited)</p>
<p>"The realtor found a handkerchief" -  real estater. Aka, the person showing them the house to rent</p>
<p>In the same emails, they also say:
"kitchen island"... now, I've never called or heard anyone say kitchen island either. But lo and behold:</p>
<p>https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=kitchen+island.&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA9L3UnKfQAhUqAsAKHWAnDuMQ_AUIBygC</p>
<p>So, perhaps these people just speak oddly to describe things.</p></p>

        <p><p>The realtor isn't showing the property. They're sweeping it. This email that went to podesta is an alert. </p>
<p>"This is embarrassing. Our realtor who leased us the property and has a good don't ask don't tell policy, brought <em>something</em> to my attention that was left behind after the most recent "party". Is it yours, do you need it back, could it be evidence, or is it just trash that I can throw out without being suicided?" </p>
<p>There. I translated the email for you. Now find out what that <em>something</em> was and stop wasting our time.</p></p>

        <p><p>Wrong</p>
<p>Because that ignores the context of the emails, in which they were looking at vacation houses. They looked at 3 in each location.</p>
<p>The URLs show the property's are to rent, which is why a realtor was at the property to begin with. </p>
<p>The first email is also sent from Kathryn, who works in real estate. Why are they with someone from real estate whilst looking at rented properties...because they want to rent a property. Specifically holiday rentals.</p>
<p>That's what all these emails are about, in context. The handkerchief email is taken out of context to fit a narrative. </p>
<p>Now look who sent the handkerchief email, Kathryn, the real estator. (who was showing them the rented property, "Thanks, Kate. We all really enjoyed it and it was very informative for us".</p>
<p>The reason she emails John over something so small is because it's her job.</p></p>

        <p><p>You're too biased for me to continue with. If you can't understand the fundamental idea behind these rental properties, I see why you're getting so far off track, but for you to defend such a position after many others have told you otherwise shows extreme cognitive dissonance. Get lost, cuck.</p></p>

        <p><p>Haha, you're too biased that you have got offended by someone giving an innocent explanation for these emails.</p>
<p>Innocent until proven guilty, I'm sure you've preached that before.
You've made the unfounded logical jump to think renting a holiday home is immediately linked to child abuse. You've then made the jump of someone leaving a handkerchief as a pedo code, rather than leaving a handkerchief.</p>
<p>Even when with a real estate agent with them the whole time (they shared a car). So I guess the real estate agent is also running in the operation! </p>
<p>It just doesn't hold up to any scrutiny. Even the smallest amount and it falls apart.</p></p>

        <p><p>Before you are burned alive let me first say I appreciate people bringing alternate views on stuff like this. Takes balls to offer up your opinion with everything so heated as it is. It shows that we are being objective (even if it means reaching) and trying to find the actual truth by looking at <em>all</em> points of view. </p>
<p>Speaking for myself personally, when you are in the trenches you start to jump to conclusions very fast and sometimes your instincts take over.</p>
<p>That said... sorry man, this isn't it. The verbiage used is beyond weird. Something is up. That of course is my personal opinion, but one that is shared by many. </p></p>

        <p><p>I liked your critical viewpoint to a degree, but honestly, do you honestly believe it meant to be face as in a surface of a handkerchief? That's a bit reaching in my opinion.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'd say it's less of a reach as the current accepted theory.</p>
<p>Face of a handkerchief makes perfect sense, if I said that, people would know what I meant.</p>
<p>Map can be used to mean face.</p>
<p>Not much of a stretch imo</p></p>

        <p><p>If you had the power... Wouldn't you try to discredit by changing definitions of words in webpages to help those trying to discredit, discredit?
That's where I'm at, and if I had to ability I would look into the last time those pages were updated, as my theory is that it is recently.</p>
<p>But back to the original comment that gave me reason to comment.
Who in the fuck would say map, instead of face, or even design.
Why go through extra steps, because if you didn't know that map meant design, and I didnt, and neither did this whole sub. Do you think that a real estate agent would have?
Its just so obscure I refuse to believe is a coincidence.</p></p>

        <p><p>Alright, answer me this:</p>
<p>In the emails, they look at 3 vacation houses to rent.
At what point, would John take out some incriminating evidence, whilst viewing a property up for rent, and place it on the kitchen island?</p>
<p>And not only that, but then say "It's not a big deal" and leave said incriminating evidence in a property none of them even own, and will be viewed by others later?</p></p>

        <p><p>It's a valid question and is why we need to keep researching. But honestly your explanation is more far fetched than what's already been floating around. And when you claim, "I've figured it out," it feels like you're trying to manipulate public opinion rather than contribute to the discussion. Snopes comes to mind and might be hiring</p></p>

        <p><p>I can answer the question.</p>
<p>He used a handkerchief to blow his nose / wipe sweat, and forgot he left it out. It's not a big deal because it's just a piece of fabric, not worth much.</p>
<p>Now, here's some more analysis which strengthens my theory.</p>
<p>" I know you’re</p>
<blockquote>
<p>busy, so feel free not to respond if it’s not yours or you don’t want it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this handkerchief was
1) A pedo code
2) Used as a momento whilst raping children (or some other theory along those lines.)</p>
<p>The people asking would already know it's his. They're using the pedo lingo, they can read the code. They would know John Podesta is involved if they even had to ask to begin with, they would not leave it there and ask if it was his A DAY later. (and by email no less, the slowest way to get an urgent message across) </p>
<p>They would know, without a doubt it was Johns. Because they would have to know about his secret, in order to know it was "pizza" related to begin with.</p>
<p>Think about it, in order for Susan to know about the pedo thing, she must know John is one. In which case, she would not ask.</p></p>

        <p><p>Still doesn't explain JP's creepy pedo art collection.  Or all the other creepy pedo shit or the spirit cooking etc.  Even if this one piece of the puzzle is a dead end as you are so desperately trying to convince us, all that other shit is still really incriminating.</p></p>

        <p><p>Having a weird and unsettling art taste does not make one a pedo.</p>
<p>We've established the woman who did the spirit cooking has links with the democratic party. And she is also known for strange contemporary art.</p>
<p>Watch the spirit cooking video, it's just some weird arty crap. Not an actual satanic ritual. They wouldn't film it and share it online, with her name attached otherwise.</p></p>
