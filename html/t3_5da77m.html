        <strong>Mention of Pedophilia in old "Heavy Breathing" music video.</strong>
        <p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_euND7Acs </p>
<p>Mentioned at 1:05.  Why would a "child friendly" venue like Comet Ping Pong even risk association with such a bunch?  </p>
<p>Oh wait, I think I know why...</p>
<p>One cheese pizza please!</p>
<p>Edit: I forgot to mention the nudity, lines of coke, and S&amp;M references.</p>
<p>When he takes off the red mask, it's almost as though that represents a pedophile acting as a young girl on the internet to lure young unknowing individuals.</p>
<p>Sickening.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's a &lt;1 second audioclip if you weren't listening for it you wouldn't have found it.  Come to think of it, it's a youtube account with less than a hundred subscribers that, before this shit, had almost no hits on this video.  </p>
<p>If you were trying to get the word out, a relatively safe and easy way would be to say "look up THIS specific video and go to THIS specific time.  You'll know it's the right video if you pay attention.  Get back to me if you like the offer."</p>
<p>Some hardcore investigation into this group is needed.</p></p>

        <p><p>Throwaway account because my head just imploded and I'm legitimately shocked at how blatant this is.</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/I3HEIha">skintight black unitard... really shows off my swimmer's build</a></p>
<p>For the (happily) uninitiated, one of the subgenres of child pornography is children wearing tight swimsuits, which can be found across MANY nonnude child porn-lite websites.  The fact that this is being discussed over a webchat is meant to show child predators... this is blatant.  This is SO fucking blatant signalling for other pedophiles that if you follow this band we can get you the goods.</p>
<p>Someone needs to download this video and get it on liveleak or other sources NOW before they pull it.</p></p>

        <p><p>They are really a family friendly band alright ....</p>
<p>https://imgur.com/gallery/Vx9cR</p>
<p>What kind of family friendly Rock band do you know of that has music videos of cocaine snorting discussing pedophilia and the basic theme of the video is a guy jerking off talking to someone else </p></p>

        <p><p>I'm confused as to how the Majestic Ape character calling the guy "gross" for possibly being a pedophile is somehow condoning pedophilia?</p>
<p>The video is about a lonely loser having a webchat that takes him on a fantasy ride with a mysterious internet lady that is ultimately revealed to be just another solo jerk session, hence why he is alone and crying at the end. He is under her mask because she never existed, she was himself all along. </p></p>

        <p><p>That's quite a stretch.</p>
<p>So since you guys talk about pedophilia and how vile it is all day and night, should I assume you are "cat fishing"?</p></p>
