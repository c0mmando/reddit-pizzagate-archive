        <p><p>There's an error message prompt thing that goes to stratfor intelligence. Then they have weird indie music that I can't find anything about on Google. And one zip file of just 20 pics of a Mac desktop and a MacBook pro.</p>
<p>Edit- here's a weird pic. Prob nothing. https://web.archive.org/web/20161020164854/http://elkinsspace.com/ikeaphoto.JPG</p>
<p>Edit- whole folder on bat conservation. With PowerPoints and mp3s</p></p>

        <p><p>It's a site from the developer who was working for stratfor.  Stratfor had some interesting emails relating to Obama's "hot dog" party with some references to hookers.  This developer built a "pizza" site for stratfor and people wanted to search through his files to figure out if any of them had steganographic CP in them.  Looks like a bunch of music with terribly tasteless names ("roach cunt")  and some pirated software.  Nothing stands out as terribly bad, but it's a lot of data to go through.</p></p>
