        <strong>Using a condom; protection first</strong>
        <p><p>Join the digging by first protecting yourself. Using Tails will add layers of protection with a leave no trace OS, TOR browser, and MAC address spoofer all built in by default. Only need 2 USB sticks to intsall.</p>
<p>ELI5: The operating system and all the anyonimizing goodies self installs onto a USB stick. Once you reboot the computer, it is like nothing you did ever existed on the computer. Nothing gets saved. TOR browser anonymizes your browsing by routing traffic through the TOR network. MAC spoofing helps to anonymize the network interface you're using. </p>
<p>Remember, always use a condom. </p>

Tails is a live operating system, that you can start on almost any computer from a DVD, USB stick, or SD card. It aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity, and helps you to:</p>
<pre><code>use the Internet anonymously and circumvent censorship;
all connections to the Internet are forced to go through the Tor network;
leave no trace on the computer you are using unless you ask it explicitly;
use state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to encrypt your files, emails and instant messaging.
</code></pre></p>
