        <strong>New illegal Content found from twittergate! Which police agency or moderator(s), should I forward info to?</strong>
        <p><p>This morning I was <a href="http://imgur.com/a/XxN3B">told</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop posting personal information and pay attention to the rules. You're getting a 3 day ban. Violate again and it's permanent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I, at no point provided any identifying information that would correlate a name or address' to anyone. After contacting the moderators, they kindly removed my ban. </p>
<p>I wan't to continue to provide information, but im trying to abide by all reddit/subreddit policies. </p>
<p>As the title states. I continued to try to correlate users and any identifying information; I have found more websites as well as some identifying names and locations. </p>
<p>What agency should I begin reporting this to? Im obviously not posting the uncovered websites to the public., But i'd definitely like to provide information to the appropriate individual(s)/agencies, as it comes, to avoid giving the pedo's an opportunity to delete or remove their site(s) and content.</p>
<p>I would also like to provide search tips/help/information, on how to help uncover more information., But I dont know if that is going to be frowned down upon by moderators, because it might lead people to potentially illegal or disturbing content.</p>
<p><strong>Edit #1</strong>: </p>
<p>There is a seriously overwhelming number of individuals to search. Here are some tips on how to help uncover individuals. You can attain access to the master list from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e2wmg/breaking_hundreds_of_child_porn_accounts_exposed/">this subreddit thread</a>.</p>
<p><strong>

<p>@eclipse_ow states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are people who are CLEARLY looking at child porn. Do not bother with people who are in South East Asian or South American countries.
Why shouldn't we care about people in South East Asia or South America?
    <em>Because a lot of the countries in these areas have VERY low consent ages. Some as low as 13.
   </em>The absolute last thing you want to do is try to "be a hero", fuck up, and end up ruining an innocent persons life.
    *Yeah it's fucked up but the law is the law. Stick to what we can actually have an impact on.</p>

<p><strong>

<p>While she is correct for the most part, some of those folks are the ones who feel more secure, and are less careful about using different screen names to conceal their identity. It didn't take me more than about an hour to start correlating names and cities. This sometimes led to other sites and domains owned.</p>
<p>Secondly, some of the vile individuals are not being discrete in anyway. Some of the user's blatantly have their profiles displaying "looking for JB" or "seeking young". Key  in on similar words in Spanish, Arabic, etc. The men sometimes present themselves seeking "jovens" (young in spanish).  </p>
<p>Below is one of the profile descriptions listed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Straight Daddy looking for princess. No dudes or couples. Yoga pants are my weakness. #bigdick #swirl my cock ðŸ‘‡
... I think you get the point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>
</strong></p>
<p>This is some sick stuff, so please take breaks and separate yourself from this, for significant chunks at a time. I literally feel sick to my stomach. I genuinely see why officers in this field need to go to mandatory counseling. This shit must be insanely taxing on those who pursue these sick fucks 24/7. </p></p>

        <p><p>Blast the information to famous based people on twitter.  State that you do not trust law enforcement to responsibly handle the sensitive information and describe what it is that you found.  There is a great contact list around here somewhere that includes people like jason chhaeffitz trey gowdy joe rogan trump, milo, alex jones anthony cumia ect</p>
<p>We need a template twitter contact list</p>
<p>Also leak to 4chan and mention this to r/thedonald - they do a great job making sure things get viral exposure</p>
<p>Back up everything as described by somebody else</p></p>

        <p><p>First, archive the hell out of everything. That way you have proof even if they take it down.</p>
<p>Second, you should probably contact a lawyer for advice.</p>
<p>Third, forward everything to your local PD, the NYPD (since this will likely dovetail with their investigation of Weiner's laptop) as well as the PD of any jurisdictions where illegal activity is taking place IRL. Also notify the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber">FBI Cyber Crime Division</a> and the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/cac">FBI Violent Crimes Against Children Division</a>.</p>
<p>I do NOT recommend saving anything offline (unless you are 100% certain it does not contain any actual CP) as that will look super sketchy on your part and is illegal in many countries. Remember, possession of CP is a strict liability crime in the US and you will be putting yourself in a shitload of legal trouble if you do this and are located in the USA <strong>REGARDLESS OF INTENT</strong>.</p></p>

        <p><p>Document everything in hard copies or on flash drives in safe hands. Report to multiple agencies as well as media and watchdog groups if possible, to ensure cross-accountability (the police may 'lose' the files, etc). And make sure there is someone you can trust who knows what you're doing. </p>
<p>Stay safe and thank you for your contribution. </p></p>

<p>That's a great way to get yourself arrested for possession of CP.</p></p>

        <p><p>Sorry, I should clarify: this is more about the details of the investigation itself rather than specifically the entire catalogue of cp.</p></p>
