        <strong>I don't think Heavy Breathing is directly involved with pedophilia</strong>
        <p><p>Maybe they really are just a "hip" band trying to be as edgy as possible? I mean, that's what gets you popular nowadays, look at Tyler The Creator, and his group OddFutureWolfGangKillThemAll. I have a lot of hipster friends that would love everything about Heavy Breathing, from their music, to their weird symbolism and occultic themes. Granted, this doesn't mean it's BAD to look into them, I just really think they're being used as a sort of "mask", to hide the REAL pedophiles. You really have to get into the mind of the enemy, these people aren't stupid. That's the first thing we all need to realize. What better way to hide yourself, than to put some weird/edgy band front and center of your whole sexual trafficking operation? This way when people start to catch on, it's easily dismissible as "they're just a popular band with a weird theme" or something. Just a lot of this "evidence" of this band I'm seeing, seems a little far fetched</p></p>

        <p><p>A lot of the "images of children" I've seen, aren't even children. I looked at one of the threads breaking down one of their videos, and some of the pictures that the poster claimed were children, weren't children at all. Like the one picture with the "child wearing a mask", looked more to me like it was just that "ape" chick, whatever she calls herself. And another picture they claimed were "young teenage boys sitting at a table", my Russian friend was sitting next to me as I looked at that picture, and he said that was a very popular picture in Russia, and they weren't young teenagers. They laughed at it. </p></p>

        <p><p>They directly reference pedophilia, all of the music is seriously deviant, outrageously, disturbingly deviant. They joke about pedophila and child abuse. They play in children's restaurants. I don't know whether they are or aren't, but they clearly have some interest in it, and are associated with many other deviants who seem likely to be pedophiles.</p></p>

        <p><p>What I think is that they're being used, and don't realize it. Looking at their response to everything going on, it seems really stupid. But it seems genuinely stupid, like this is just their style, and they're trying to be edgy, but they don't realize what's really going on in the background. Also, looking at their friend "tardbuster", their responses also seem very genuine, and they bring up some great points. Like, "why would the pedophile culture, still embrace the same symbolism, when it's obviously been discovered by the FBI?". That's a good point, and this opens up 2 likely scenarios. </p>
<p>Scenario A: Pedophile culture still embraces these symbols, because they can use that as a scapegoat to dismissing their actions. "You think we're that stupid? To use these logos that everyone knows?". With that being said, I don't think the general populace has the critical thinking skills to come to this conclusion. They'll just learn the symbols, see them, and make the association, and start pointing fingers. </p>
<p>Scenario B: We're dealing with VERY intelligent people, who look at this like a game of chess. They realize that it's impossible to not leave behind some sort of breadcrumb trail, so their best option to getting people off their trail, is to create other breadcrumb trails that lead to dead-ends. They make these trails the easiest to stumble upon, and have them all lead to "satanic", "occultic" symbols, or references. This makes people believe that they stumbled upon something crazy, when in reality, it makes us all look crazy, and gets everyone looking in the wrong places. Once we get onto one of their breadcrumb trails, they have control over us like puppets. Then, all they have to do is keep sprinkling in some misinformation, related to this "satanic discovery" someone made, and keep us following down the wrong trail. </p>
<p>With this being said, hopefully these people aren't as smart as I'm thinking they are. But I'm just trying to think of what I would do, if I were some elite pedophile </p></p>

        <p><p>I sort of agree with you, but some new things have me thinking otherwise (to some degree).</p>
<p>After seeing the Heavy Breathing video in slow-motion (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oicUO0sz08c), I became a little more skepticle about the group. Too many references or direct images of "baba", "baba's mountain", obscene sexual acts, etc.</p>
<p>After someone posted a link to their old group's website., Theapes.com , I noticed that the home page had now been replaced by a new 404. So someone went out of their way to try to "conceal" the rest of the website. </p>
<p>Another redditor, found links to other pages under their domain: http://www.theapes.com/babas1.html , http://www.theapes.com/babas2.html , 
http://www.theapes.com/babas3.html , of which, make too many references, to what I can only assume, is telling adolescents to run away, and not believe what their parents have told them. Make your own assumptions after viewing. </p>
<p>After viewing all this. I thought I was kinda going nuts, so I didn't want to jump to conclusions. </p>
<p>I scanned the website directories and found a handful of other pages that people haven't mentioned (I dont think). </p>

<p>Anyways, after browsing through the directory, I came across http://www.theapes.com/bio.html, which allows you to fully view the site. Archive as much as you can, as soon as you can. </p>
<p>From here, a few interesting videos, links, and "journal entry's" are made present of "The Apes" travel history from 1999-2008.  </p>

<p>*http://www.theapes.com/press.html</p>
<p>I haven't gotten the opportunity to scan through everything on the website, but I got to read one of the press articles linked through there.</p>
<p>http://dcist.com/2012/12/three_stars_heavy_breathing.php</p>
<p>This article seemed rather normal for the most part. The musicians came off as regular "goof" musicians to me, but one thing kinda threw me off., </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, does this make DIY spaces more difficult or does it just depend?</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>    &gt;It just depends. The first time you put on a show anyplace you don’t notice the small little details about things. Like that bands need a place to set up and if there’s a party going on it’s like how do they get their equipment out of there. It’s just little things that come into play after you do it a bunch. I think a lot of people think, “Yeah, it’s fun! I’ll put on a show!” and they don’t realize or they get out of putting on shows really fast because they’re like, “Yeah, this is kind of a hassle.” Some of the best shows we’ve played have been in basements but other times it’s been like a living nightmare. Like, you get to the person’s house and it’s like, two kids on the sofa. And they’re like, “Hey, we can fix you some food.” That happens a lot. But it’s still fun.
</code></pre>
<p>Those last two sentences kinda threw me off. This article was written in 2012. They began the "band" and cataloging their tours,
around 1999. Traveling across the country to different venues (small events for the most part)., But even went on to travel throughout Europe in 2002.  Why would a band with over 12 years experience be hassling themselves for a private event at a house, with a crowd of two children? Lets not forget the type of music they are playing, the rapid subconscious images of pedophiles and sexual acts, or their messages of not listening to parents., Run away from home and come to <a href="http://www.theapes.com/babas1.html">our mountain retreat</a>.</p>
<p>At this point, I became a little weirded out and thought I might be going a little insane. But someone definitely tried to conceal their website.</p>
<p>After searching their past shows, it looks like they have been Playing Comet's Pizza since 2006. I assumed someone had to book them, so I looked into their booking and promotions person listed, Sasha Lord. </p>
<p>After browsing her website http://www.sashalordpresents.com/about-2/, I didnt find much of anything to indicate or correlate any "redflags". Ran some software  scanning for repeat or key words and got nothing significant from her website. Ran it on the band names and got a "commodoregilgamesh" for some reason. After googling the name, I came to http://commodoregilgamesh.com/ . And after browsing (4) videos, I am done "pizzagate-ing" for the day. Pretty sure im going nuts now.</p>
<p>Archive whatever you guys think is important. If anything.</p></p>

        <p><p>Underrated post here, if a little long.</p>
<p>TL;DR the other act associated with Amanda Kleinman has some creepy shit saying to post a <a href="https://i.sli.mg/z4pNhO.gif">mark</a> on your door and a Green Bus will come by and take you away to Baba's Mountain. They're referencing <a href="http://www.saibaba-x.org.uk/6/saisex6.htm">Sathya Sai Baba</a>. And encouraging young adolescents to run away from home and join them there.</p>
<p>EDIT: Rehosted image as they're probably moving to shut down this site now, or at least hide the index until shit blows over.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is an interesting point.  I guess my biggest issue with Heavy Breathing in general is the normalization of child abuse at a "family friendly" restaurant.</p></p>

        <p><p>People think - if they're a social deviant in one domain (music, dress, art, ...), then they're likely deviants in other domains.</p>
<p>Or: "Where there's smoke, there's fire."</p>
<p>A better "cover" would be something squeaky-clean. But that's not who they hang with.</p></p>

        <p><p>This sub went from quietly researching the most powerful people on the planet because we thought 'Pizza' was a code word. Comet was interesting, but it was no where near the center, because everyone researched the shit out of everyone there and there wasn't any real evidence. Then word got out, and people thought the 'pizza' in 'pizza-gate' referred to Comet, and put a bunch of people on blast, claiming some weird performances were 'proof' that everyone at Comet and everyone connected are pedophiles, slapped together some MS Paint graphics, and proceeded to fuck up a bunch of people's lives, with nothing more than their shitty interpretations of things they don't get. </p>
<p>Did you ever stop and think "Hey, what if the fact that the THOUSANDS of us digging on the people around the pizza place didn't turn up anything we didn't have the first day is an indicator that there isn't anything going on there" or "What kind of person am I to call someone that works with kids a pedophile, along with thousands of others, based on a hunch?"</p>
<p>What kind of person blows up another persons life and associates them forever with a pedophile ring, without at least one piece of solid evidence? </p>
<p>A scumbag. An investigation into top government officials involved in a pedophile ring going back upwards of 50 years turned into a witch hunt for a couple people that like mildly controversial stuff, like bondage, and probably ruined any chance of passing any interview in the future where they do a background check, and there isn't a single person going to jail, because there isn't a shred of evidence. </p></p>

        <p><p>my old manager was an occultist. he wasnt successful by any means but i know alot of people in music who practice the occult. i never saw it as more than "being edgy" like you said but there was one guy i did a few releases for who owned an occult bookshop in London and his network were all practicing occultists. it does go beyond the theme as practicing magick isnt exclusive to pedophilia there are lesser spells etc etc. while i agree we shouldnt jump to conclusions you can bet your ass an occult musician, maybe they are a lesser practitioner or dont know the extent of what the people around them are involved in, are definitely practicing the occult in some form or another.</p></p>
