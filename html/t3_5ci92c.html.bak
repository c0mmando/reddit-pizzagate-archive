        <strong>Contact trustworthy watchdog groups, courageous politicians, and reputable media outlets. Tell them what's happening.</strong>
        <p><p>Folks, if we're going to be successful at exposing this sick shit, we need to do more than just poke around blindly. Get in touch with groups like Judicial Watch (already emailed them), upstanding journalists (the more the better), and members of Congress with a reputation for doing the right thing, such as Trey Gowdy.</p>
<p>Use a throwaway email service such as mailinator.com to make initial contact; never reveal your real name or contact information. Just put people on the trail and let them do their thing.</p>
<p><em>We cannot and should not do this alone</em>. In fact, most of us don't have the expertise to do anything other than tip the pedos off and make the investigation more difficult. <strong>THEY ARE WATCHING THIS SUB. THEY ARE WATCHING THE CHANS.</strong> By posting information here, you are letting them know exactly how much we know. <strong>WHEN YOU FIND SOMETHING, UNLESS YOU ARE AN EXPERT HACKER, SIMPLY ARCHIVE IT AND PASS THE INFORMATION ON TO TRUSTED CONTACTS. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU BE POSTING NEW LEADS HERE.</strong></p>
<h1>TRUST NO ONE.</h1></p>

        <p><p>NO! </p>
<p>Dude, what you're asking is for us to trust the PTB to handle this because it's "too sensitive" for us normies. That is how we got here, and that is what has allowed them to hide for so long. Let us experiment. Let us see what we're made of. I bet that it's going to be beautiful. <strong>Speak to our power, or our pride if anything, but never, ever speak to the fear of impotence if empowerment is your goal.</strong></p></p>

        <p><p>Rather, I say to develop your intuition, trusting it only so far as you know it, and never trusting another person's unless you know it absolutely, which is rare and sometimes difficult, usually reserved for close friends, colleagues, or spouses. I feel I should say that I'm not writing about a feeling, but a real, unnameable certainty in another that we could call "love", but is closer to unconditional understanding.</p>
<p>You can trust Wikileaks' information, but in the wake of Assange possibly being incarcerated/dead, can you trust how they release? It's apparent that the impact of their information has decreased since the time that the Ecuadorian embassy cut his internet, and any number of agendaed people might be at the helm at this point, which is not to say that Assange himself didn't have an agenda, but I liked his at least, and he stuck to it in a principled way that I think anyone can respect. You can usually trust Judicial Watch, and their staff is open and generally seem to be good people, but again you should be certain of the information that you understand is true, and only if you understand how it is. I.e, it's not enough to trust Reddit's whims and feelings towards journalists or groups- you have to do the work yourself. </p>
<p>Sometimes it's all we can do to trust, but it should never be used unless necessary, when knowing with certainty is your actual goal. It is a real feeling, certainty is, and I can not help but imagine that the decline in it among our society is a direct result of too much sourcing and not enough reflection. Our boxes and our compartments make things much easier to grasp, but they rarely help us understand.</p></p>

        <p><p>The only time to report information is when it can be conclusively - and <em>replicably</em> - proven through documented forensic methods.</p>
<p>If we come up with a method to extract condemning information from existing published Wikileaks documents (such as an innocent-looking email attachment), anybody from major media outlets to any given random computer user should be able to replicate the findings to have the same result if we publish the approach that we obtained our conclusions.  It's the scientific method.  Hypothetically, if we prove that a picture of a puppy can be turned into evidence of human trafficking, that's impossible to ignore.  The only way to discredit that would be if there was something astray in the methodology, which there won't be.</p>
<p>Hold out until we have indisputable evidence.  It will be worth it, trust me.</p></p>

        <p><p>Alex jones isn't a god. literally he's a rich hollywood dude making a shit ton of money off of right-wing nuts who believe anything that clashes with their worldview is a government conspiracy. so alex jones isn't to be trusted at all. he literally takes advantage of and profits off of people's fears.</p>
<p>listen. alex jones interviewed donald trump, who was circled and listed of epstein's little black book showing the witnesses and victims of epstein's pedo ring. so he isn't to be trusted. </p>
<p>I'm not really sure who to trust. but alex jones is definitely not it.</p></p>

        <p><p>I had heard Trump had taken a trip or two on the Lolita express, what does that mean though??? If Trump were to be involved in this pedo thing, then why were the pedos themselves so terrified of him winning? </p>
<p>(Unless Trump is some giant culmination of controlled opposition meant to act as a catharsis for us and all our pent up frustration for the establishment? Dear God what can I believe anymore?)</p></p>

        <p><p>Everyone at the top is blackmailed or afraid of being killed.  We are the media.  By all means try to spread info to the news but be VERY CAREFUL.  Even some of the alt-media organizations like infowars are completely corrupted and won't break the breaking news for you.  We have gotten this far for a reason.  OPEN SOURCE INTELLIGENCE WORKS.  WE ARE THE MEDIA.</p></p>
