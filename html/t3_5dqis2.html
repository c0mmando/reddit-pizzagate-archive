        <strong>I found something. I haven't seen anyone else post this yet!</strong>
        <p><p>Dr. Pong is a friend under cometpingpong.com. Dr. Pongs website has a tab called Bilder. If you click code it leads to a photo of a toilet with the Definition of Pipto. Under their Linken tab there is a series of links, one leads to a page with a login and password screen. This is the website Tanzinsicht.de... I haven't seen anything on this yet so I thought I'd share.</p></p>

        <p><p>Fotoforensics results!</p>

<p>I'm going to try some tests but I have never done stenography.  Let me say that it DOES look like a very fishy image to me</p>
<p>EDIT: Found an alternate site containing the image http://lambrusco.pipto.com/index.php?folder=0562-Chris_n_Palm_in_Berlin_-_July_23rd_2005#P1050407.jpg</p>
<p>It seriously just looks like an artist</p>
<p>I found more stuff from him</p>
<p>http://gaderne.pipto.com/index.php?show=0</p>
<p>Looks more like pipto.com is just an image hosting site.  Someone do a whois lookup maybe?</p>
<p>This may just be a false lead but who knows :\</p>
<p>EDIT 1: Gay porno in a trash bin? http://lambrusco.pipto.com/index.php?folder=0362-Berlin_Week_04_-_2004&amp;foto=DSC01512.JPG</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Link to Dr. Pong confirmed: http://lambrusco.pipto.com/photos/0552-Dr_Dong_-_July_7th_2005/Photos/Billede%20423%20%28Large%29.jpg (note paddle in back pocket)</p>
<p>FINAL EDIT: There's nothing to be found AFAIK... it's just the guy who runs Dr. Pong's image server, he seems to be into like poetry and other stuff</p>
<p>Find it all here: https://www.google.com/search?q=site:pipto.com</p></p>

<p>Goddamn it the number of times i've said that the past few days while looking into all this shit.</p>
<p>I still can't decide if we are on the verge of unveiling one of the largest cover ups in the history of the human race, or it is a bunch of edgy artists that politicians and rich people hang out with. Aristocrats have always been decadent and commission artists to create whatever is popular to make their guests see them as "cultured".</p>
<p>But like my dad said about the Clinton emails: "when there is this much smoke, there has to be a fire."</p>
<p>I think a part of me just doesn't want to believe any of this. I want to be proven wrong so I can go back to living in a world where pedophiles are the obvious pervert in the back alleys and white vans.</p>
<p>I'm going to go to bed. Tomorrow I will decide what to do with this information.</p></p>

<p>Current task at hand is getting all those (lambrusco.pipto.com) images and detecting any potential steganography, will take a little while.</p></p>
