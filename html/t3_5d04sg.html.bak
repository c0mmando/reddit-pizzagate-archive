        <strong>ITT: Actionable plan to bring down global pedo ring</strong>
        <p><p>Please share your ideas. </p>
<p>I'm thinking - we need to film a "pizza party" with a mini drone with livestream cam (get clear shots of the faces of the people attending) and get some hackers to intercept broadcast signals and air that shit everywhere.</p>
<p>We can't talk and do nothing. If you have a skill like programming, use it. If you don't have a skill, learn one. Flood the STEM fields.</p>
<p>I will literally dedicate my life to this.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is a public place. Has anyone in the DC area gone in and checked it out?</p></p>

        <p><p>If it is really a global pedo ring, pizza corner in DC is just one small part. Exposing it will not bring down the global ring.</p>
<p>The only way to bring down the global ring is;
1. gathering and preserving evidence
2. slowly getting to word out to the normies so when it hits the fan they will believe us
3. get enough normie support so victims know they will be believed and supported when they come out. Their testimony and support of the community is vital.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage we have is that we have many eyes and ears all over the world, and local expertise. They don't know who we are. We are perfect undercover agents. </p>
<p>The best thing to do is look in your own neighborhood. You know what to look for now (symbolism), if you don't, learn. Plus you have local knowledge. When it comes out you may have important evidence. Take notes, dates, anything that stands out. Play it low-key. Keep it to yourself for now until you see it linking to something else. Visit your local ping-pong/pizza/bowling/shopping plaza/skater park whatever, note and document anything suspicious. Research the kids that went missing from your town in the last decade, the people involved. Just take note and keep your eyes peeled.</p></p>

        <p><p>Their ritual sites are known. Its a matter of being able to view them when they are there. Keep in mind they likely have the place scouted for miles and would be difficult to infiltrate.</p></p>

        <p><p>The law? They could call the police and have everyone removed.</p></p>

        <p><p>So what if they get removed. I'd be willing to bet nobody gets arrested. Think of how it would look if the police arrested people for investigating child trafficking. </p>
<p>That would bring media attention. </p></p>
