        <strong>[Meta] How to increase sensibility and credibility in this sub.</strong>
        <p><p>This sub, like many other conspiracy-type subs is very prone to shenanigans and trolling. I think we need a serious discussion to figure out modding properly and efficiently.</p>
<p>When I see things like [this] (https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e25gv/2107_hidden_podesta_emails_not_listed_in/da94dud/) I want to hit my head against the wall. This chain occupies valuable real estate at the top of the submission. We should <em>not</em> tolerate crap like this as it completely distracts from everything else.</p>
<p>The mods have done a good job so far at removing memes and I thank them for that. However, this sub needs much stricter modding (in my opinion) in terms of what goes.</p>
<p>Please discuss whether you agree/disagree and hopefully we can all come to some reasonable conclusions. Mods, please keep doing the great work I'm not trying to attack you guys.</p></p>

        <p><p>The shills are dying off... either the money ran out... or their bosses are under arrest... but "CTR" used to be able to swing 4000 upvotes or downvotes whenever they needed... and now they are pruned down to like 50... The empire is crumbling... the shills have to resort to one on one combat trying to keep the lid on this... to have Comet remain the only implicated place... and they are bad at it. </p></p>

        <p><p>I agree with OP.</p>
<p>The subject matter of this sub requires extreme documentation. People will not want to believe it, and establishing credibility will be very difficult.</p>
<p>In cases where threads are untrue, they must be clearly marked. There will necessarily be many dead ends.</p></p>
