        <p><p>Okay; so I just typed in some of the people i had been tweeting to with the tag #pizzagate I used, and its now only showing my posts/posts from yesterday.. nothing fresh from today.. wtf</p>
<p>Infact most of my tweets have stopped getting any attention, all about 16 hous ago - prior to this it was getting likes and RTs.. strange.</p></p>
