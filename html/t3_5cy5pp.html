        <p><p>They still use pizza as meaning for something else though:
https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/13/1323438_re-today-s-pitch-.html</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is pizza in your future. Thanks again for all your efforts.
Looking forward to what comes... including the pizza.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the e-mails made it seem that the "pizza-pages" were some kind of subscription based intel-sharing, but the employees of stratfor should have access to that information either way?. There were some other e-mails which were talking about pizza in some weird way. Not really sure what they might be talking about with those terms though.</p></p>
