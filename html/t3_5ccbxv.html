<h1>3 ) ADDITIONAL RESOURCES NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO WIKILEAKS:</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Mountain of Evidence for a Massive International Pedophile Ring Protected by Police and Intelligence Agencies:</strong></p>
<p>This is very good and detailed background information into how extensive this all actually is. Anyone truly interested in understanding this subject should read this, it was posted by a redditor on /r/conspiracy 3 years ago:  https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/</p>

<h1>4 ) PROTECTING YOUR ANONYMITY (VERY IMPORTANT!!!):</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>1) Using some combination of a throwaway account, Tor, and VPN are good simple ways to protect anonymity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>DO NOT use Tor if you aren't extremely well versed in it, if you connect to the wrong node you could be unwittingly transmitting cp to other computers without even knowing it.</strong> 
- Thanks /user/Antaria/</p>
<p><strong>2) TAILS is a good Linux distro that routes all internet traffic through TOR by default. If you want to be super paranoid, burn the bootable image to CD and run it on a machine with no hard drive connected. Short of a cold-boot RAM attack (not gonna happen), there's ZERO data that can possibly be stored on your computer, and the only concern is if the TOR exit node is being sniffed. That can also be circumvented by running in from public WiFi (ideally with your back to a wall in a coffee shop with no security cameras. Pay cash for anything you buy). At that point the absolute worst that somebody could figure out is the general city you're in.</strong>
- Thanks /user/JangoTheJanitor/</p>
<p><em>Please let me know if you know of anything else people can use to protect their anonymity in this investigation.</em></p>
<hr>
<h1>5) RESEARCHING/ARCHIVING/DOCUMENTING GUIDELINES FOR PROPER AND THOROUGH INVESTIGATION</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>It is very important that everyone archive all of their research because everything is being removed as soon as it is being discovered. http://archive.is/ is useful but is also a good idea to save anything you find and re-upload it to a 3rd party source like http://sli.mg/</strong></p>
<p><strong>I do not think it is a good idea to inform anyone your investigating or suspicious of that you are on to them because that gives them an opportunity to destroy evidence. Do not harass people!</strong></p>
<p><em>Please let me know if you know of any other resources that you think would be useful in documenting this investigation.</em></p>
<hr>
<h1><strong>6) SUBREDDIT RULES</strong></h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: We are a politically neutral subreddit! This is not about the left vs the right or any other ideology. This is about good vs evil, the people vs the globalists elites, and this evil crosses political affiliations. Do not be politically biased and be open to new information.</strong></p>
<p><strong> Please do not start witch-hunts or doxx people as that will be the fastest way they shutdown this subreddit.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Please report anyone witch-hunting, doxxing, posting blatant misinformation, making threatening/violent posts, posting about engaging in illegal activities/breaking the law, concern trolling, obvious CTR, or derailing from the goals of this subreddit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>IT IS IMMENSELY IMPORTANT THAT WE STICK TO THINGS WE HAVE EVIDENCE TO BACK UP, THERE IS PLENTY OF ACTUAL EVIDENCE LINKED TO CONNECTIONS MADE FROM THE WIKILEAKS EMAILS!</strong> </p>
<p><strong>PLEASE REFRAIN FROM HAVING DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE HEAVILY ROOTED IN CONSPIRACIES AND HAVE NO SOURCES!</strong></p>
<p><strong>STAY ON TOPIC</strong></p>
<hr>
<h1><strong>7) COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES:</strong></h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>This subreddit is specifically for discussing and investigating the international human trafficking ring/child sex trafficking ring/pedo-ring that was uncovered by the leaked Podesta/DNC emails dumped by Wikileaks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our main goals as a community are to document the evidence, raise awareness, seek justice for all of the lives that have been ruined by theses disgusting people, but most importantly to do our best to try and save these children who are being subjected to this and to prevent any future children from being subjected to this great evil of humanity that needs to be removed from our society once and for all.</strong></p>
<h1>“All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.”</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>PLEASE let me know if you have any suggestions or additions!</strong></p>
<p><strong>I need more help with organizing the information and compiling important/valuable links!</strong></p></p>

        <p><p>So would just a VPN be sufficient? Or are there resources you could link showing how to avoid a situation like you posted? If not TOR, is there a certain browser with plugins/add-ons you would recommend? I want to help anyway that I can, but anonymity is a concern of mine. </p></p>

        <p><p>TAILS is a good Linux distro that routes all internet traffic through TOR by default.  If you want to be super paranoid, burn the bootable image to CD and run it on a machine with no hard drive connected.  Short of a cold-boot RAM attack (not gonna happen), there's ZERO data that can possibly be stored on your computer, and the only concern is if the TOR exit node is being sniffed.</p>
<p>That can also be circumvented by running in from public WiFi (ideally with your back to a wall in a coffee shop with no security cameras.  Pay cash for anything you buy).  At that point the absolute worst that somebody could figure out is the general city you're in.</p></p>

        <p><p><strong>This.</strong></p>
<p>Seriously - we need to get this well organized and described in an easy-to-understand manner.  Others are curious and coming to this subreddit to see what is going on; however, it's a little bit difficult to follow the trail if you weren't already there for the beginning of the investigation.</p>
<p>Sure would be nice if there was one centralized place we could go where we knew posts were not being deleted.</p></p>

<p>A ton of bizarre social media posts relating to comet ping pong </p>
<p>https://sli.mg/a/AC3xKr (can someone archive?) </p>
<p>Information about Big Cheese (company that owns comet, and other business) / the other owners and possible ties to the Clintons</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5c5q24/connection_between_businesses_big_cheese_llc/</p>
<p>Some sketch website for a company that is affiliated with comet ping pong (at the bottom of the site, it says "for more food and fun, check out our other business, comet ping pong). </p>
<p>http://www.bucksfishingandcamping.com/?branch_used=true</p>
<p>Speculation of a government official that may be involved (he went and liked a bunch of comet pizza Instagram posts and works close by, in a division that heads crimes related to this topic) which is said to have caused an immediate ddos attack on 4chan</p>
