        <strong>So I took a Chance and Contacted the FBI</strong>
        <p><p>After seeing the photos of the kids, blood, knife to the throat and everything, I decided to reach out and try and make contact with the FBI..
 With my background I had hoped to be able to find someone within the FBI that I could visit with, that would in the very least want to learn more about those photos.
 So I did the FBI online tip thing, and called and left a message with a local field office. I told them the details of the photos and the very basics of how I came across...</p>
<p>It's been two days now, still no reply.. If nothing soon I may try something else, but it's pretty telling isn't it</p></p>

        <p><p>It's possible that the FBI is waiting until after Trump's inauguration to move on this so that Obama can't make any last minute pardons.</p></p>

        <p><p>FBI Anon and the coded messages from the FBI Vault Twitter page are what originally prompted people to start investigating the Podesta pedophile connections. I believe there are some honest agents in there that want to take these monsters down. I don't know if upper management will let them, though.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah I believe FBI Anon was probably a legitimate whistle blower. I also believe the FBI as an entire organization is probably in favor of the ruling class though, even if they are breaking laws. Didn't FBI Anon themselves say Comey was compromised? </p></p>

        <p><p>He said Comey was looking to protect his hide, or something of that nature - same with Lynch. </p>
<p>Specifically about Lynch, he mentioned that she had donated to the Clinton Foundation, so if that whole ship went down, so would her fortunes. </p>
<p>What's interesting though is that he really wanted everyone to focus on the Foundation - his mentions of the pedo stuff was really besides the main emphasis... which kinda makes you wonder. If this is just a sideshow, what is the main gig?</p></p>

        <p><p>This is the thing, again even though we are emotionally bothered by this, we have to remember this has been going on for years if not decades. As painful as it might be to wait 3 months, it might be the only way to act if we get Trump in office, clean out the Democrats currently in office and then strike. Because while the DNC have their Presidential Candidate in Office Obama, it does put a damper on any actions they might take.</p></p>

        <p><p>You could try for a fucking grandmaster chess move.</p>
<p>You give all this evidence to some other countries agencies without telling them the location and you call their media, for example, you call the sensational media of portugal:</p>
<p>"Holy shit, we have just found out who the guys are from Madelein's case. We have uncovered a whole sex ring".</p>
<p>Or any other sensationalist story.</p>
<p>If you want to push the FBI or any other agency, you have to make the media expose this, if not the FBI will wait for this to die out, possibly Trump.</p></p>

        <p><p>Foolish Padawan. The FBI already knows and HAS for decades, the only thing that MIGHT force their hand is if we find enough evidence to raise public awareness and outrage.
Not to mention if anyone MIGHT be brought to justice it will only happen AFTER Jan 21st (after Obama has a chance to hand out pardons).
On the plus side: now they know who you are, where you live and what you know, which is NOTHING. So basically you just filed a false report with the FBI, which is a felony ;)</p></p>

        <p><p>Just thought I'd chime in here.  I personally know a fbi agent who specifically handles/researches pedophile cases and has been working at his location for years.  I contacted him after reading a bunch of posts in this sub a while back.  I figured he couldn't talk about anything specific, but he had zero knowledge of the stuff being posted here.  He said that he specifically handles all of the cases that are in his district/state, and he wouldn't be on cases if they weren't in his area.  He asked for links to this sub or online stories so that he could read them.  He said he'd submit them to DC, or the offices that would be relevant.  I didn't really realize he only dealt with local cases, but I guess that makes sense.  It also probably makes things increasingly more difficult if they have to coordinate efforts across various cities/state fbi locations if the "pedophile ring" goes into various states.  </p></p>
