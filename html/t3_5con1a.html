        <strong>Holy shit! A short documentary about James Alefantis and DC's local art scene. (SPOILER ALERT: He's an uptalker!) He names some names too.</strong>

        <p><p>Things I noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>More "hiding in plain sight" tactics.  Why make this video? Why make the video for Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives? Why publicly promote something that thrives on secrecy?  This has to be more calculated than a Yahoo video feature on an otherwise fairly unremarkable place</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Around the 3:20 mark - Alefantis mentions founding a studio collective called Square Form - which allows him to "produce custom furniture and literally have my own guys building everything custom in my restaurants."  That raises some eyebrows.  Especially in the context of the refrigeration room that was revealed on Alefantis' IG account (also omitted from the most recent Health Inspection for Comet Pizza).  Also peculiar considering the picture of his crew digging through the subfloor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit 1: Searched Google for Square Form in DC (https://www.google.com/maps/place/Square+Form/@38.9560411,-77.0689761,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7c9b98f61ad27:0xe8e3492495baead4!8m2!3d38.9560369!4d-77.0667874) ...it only has a couple reviews...but one of them is from none other than Abdoulaye Koundara Diallo.  Refer to this post for more info: https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5clmo3/wtf_post_with_1000_votes_vanished/d9xgz1h/ - this may not lead anywhere, but it seems to lend more context to the fact Alefantis seems to be skirting the need for construction permits.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Trying to archive.  I've got screenshots, but I'm having trouble with Archive.org.  When I go to upload, the process initiates but I get a 403 Forbidden error.  I get hit with this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt;

</blockquote>
<p>I'm reaching the limits of my technical know-how, so if anyone can help me, it'd be much appreciated.  I'm using Tor, and I've tried toggling JavaScript off in order to complete this action, but to no avail.</p></p>
