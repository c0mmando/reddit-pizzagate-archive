        <strong>Any new Official statements? Twitter? FBI? Police? Comet? Celebrities? Has anyone acknowledged this publicly?</strong>
        <p><p>Surely people have got to start taking notice of this now; has this been remotely acknowledged by anyone that is involved or should be here? They must be aware this is blowing the fuck up right now, and isnt going to be getting any smaller anytime soon...</p>
<p>I know some people were tweeting celebs yesterday? any responses or updates?</p></p>

<p>Doesn't actually attempt to debunk any of the allegations. Unsure why they used the term 'Fact check' either.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think they felt it was self explanatory especially after talking to the parents of the kids.  No evidence of wrongdoing.  </p></p>

        <p><p>There is also no evidence that they spoke to the parents. I would love to hear the explanation for the 'jamescomet' instagram pictures.</p></p>

        <p><p>And we shouldn't. The article is a slap in the face to journalistic integrity, the people here searching for the truth, and to victims of child abuse. They don't address any of the facts. They say this is all the result of "fake news" while they go on to create their own fake news. The author accuses us of claiming that Hillary is abusing children in the back rooms of Comet Pizza. Not true. And they also claim that this simply arose because of a Wikileaks email that showed James supported the Hillary campaign. Also not true.</p>
<p>I'm not surprised one bit at the sleaziness of this author, and I expect things to only get worse in the MSM. But they're on the losing side of history. They already exposed themselves as the real "fake news" during the election, and they have little credibility with the American people now. The more they try to discredit the story, the more people will dig into the facts. Even though I despise them, they are unwittingly helping us open the floodgates of truth</p></p>
