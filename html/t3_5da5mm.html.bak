        <strong>Small bit of misinformation out there for Angels of Love (Silsby). The gated and barred house people are posting is the wrong address</strong>

<p>Don't feel like posting the whole backstory for those that aren't familiar, feel free to look it up, but for those that were following the pizzapac/pizza packet leads and "Angels of Love" referring to the house that looks like a prison in Miami Beach, it is completely the wrong house.  Unless they have the wrong address on the house itself.  The address listed (according to posts) is 15592 NE 15th ave in North Miami.  This is the house that it brings up on google maps.  Zoom in a bit.  You can clearly see this number is NOT 15592.  Looks to me like 15521.  </p>
<p>I tried going up and down the street to locate the "real" 15521, but this is one of those super fun neighborhoods that seems to detest having house numbers visible.  Sorry to be a buzzkill</p></p>
