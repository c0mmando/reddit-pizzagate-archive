        <strong>CRITICAL THINKING REQUIRED: This is why you can't summarily dismiss the police sketches of the Podestas because of the initial "only one man" story.</strong>
        <p><p>I am posting this here because it keeps coming up and we need to think carefully about it. </p>
<p>The claim is this (or something close to this): the police sketches <em>can't possibly</em> match the Podesta brothers, because witnesses told the police there was only one suspect, and the sketches were based on this witness testimony. </p>
<p>There are two reasons why this is poor reasoning. </p>
<p><strong><em>First</em></strong>, it is not entirely accurate. Police did not <em>conclude with certainty</em> that there was just one suspect; far from it, they only tacitly <em>believed</em> there was one suspect based on preliminary reports. Here is the <a href="https://i.sli.mg/be4NrS">exact language they used.</a></p>
<p>And it is only right that they should use language of belief rather than certain proof, for that is how rational inquiry works.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the <strong><em>second</em></strong> (and more damaging) problem with the claim. </p>
<p>Due to the <em>inductive</em> nature of police investigations, initial suppositions based on preliminary reports can always be revised in light of newer evidence.  If new evidence emerges suggesting that more than one suspect was involved, the original accounts would be revised. It would be contrary to the spirit of rational inquiry to maintain that preliminary reports have absolute, dogmatic veto power over any forthcoming evidence.</p>
<p>And that is indeed what we have here. The <em>empirical</em> resemblance of both Podesta brothers — down to the mole above the eyebrow — outweighs the <em>mere supposition</em> that there may have been only one suspect.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/lU1eaN">Here is a diagram showing that even the smallest details match</a> -- such as the depression marks on the ridge of John's nose which would be caused by wearing glasses long-term, as well as the mole above Tony's eyebrow, the skin complexion, the 5 O’clock shadow facial hair, the distance between the eyes, the facial contours and symmetry, etc. </p>
<p>In order to continue maintaining this idea that the sketches must be automatically dismissed, you must (a) take the police statement out of context and attribute to them a much stronger claim than they actually made. They did not say it was <em>conclusive</em>, but that they <em>believed</em> there was one suspect. The language of belief rather than certainty is typical because investigators want to remain open to future evidence.  </p>
<p>And you must (b) grant dogmatic status to preliminary reports so that any future evidence must be dismissed no matter how empirically compelling it is -- which is just bad epistemology. From the fact that initial reports suggested only one suspect, it does not follow that those reports are gospel and can be used to automatically rule out any newer evidence, especially when the latter is quite powerful on its own. </p>
<p>(To use a crude example, it used to be a deeply held and widely shared belief that the universe was static. It wasn't until observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation and other phenomena that cosmologists came to the unbelievable conclusion that spacetime itself is expanding. Now most everybody takes big bang cosmology for granted, but imagine if we had clung to the static view simply because it was "what the original astronomers said!")</p>
<p>In short, it is both factually inaccurate and epistemologically problematic to continue claiming that the sketches must be dismissed out of hand based on preliminary reports.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm convinced that these composites were the police's way of ratting out the Podestas since they weren't allowed to arrest them.</p>
<p>Those pictures are just too dead on of a match to have been based on witness recollection alone.</p></p>

        <p><p>This. How would a witness be able to make out the mole on someone's forehead in the dark from a distance? It just doesn't make sense. Something else is going on.</p></p>

        <p><p>Seems pretty harsh to immediately dismiss someone as a shill and CTR just for not subscribing to this theory.  So far what do we have?  Sketch that looks similar and suspected email scrub?  That's not enough to convince many rational people.</p>
<p>My question is this.  What other potential evidence is there.  I am not familiar with passport record keeping.  Is that something we could FOIA?  Anything else from Washington that we could correlate?  I'm open to the theory, but I didn't follow Mccann that much through the years, so not really caught up to speed.  </p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>What other potential evidence is there</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Um, none without being a LEO, with power to request a warrant to determine their physical location at the time of the crime.</p>
<p>However, the fact that many of the facial features are <strong>identical</strong> heavily indicates they were involved.</p>
<p>Add in the fact, that one of these men has admitted to molesting children. Recent revelations, of numerous pieces of circumstantial FACTS, very strongly indicate John is also a pedophile.</p>
<p>Known child molester and millionaire, Clement Freud, owns mansion 3 miles from scene.</p>
<p>The two sketches, and the mind-blowingly obvious similarity between these two child molesters, are more than enough to warrant an investigation.</p></p>

        <p><p>I was skeptical because of the nature of the composites.  I thought that level of detail wouldn't be reliable on a night time sighting (which I thought this was referencing).  They suggested that maybe this was a leak from a Portuguese law enforcement insider, which explains the delay.  That would make much more sense to me</p></p>

        <p><p>No I just try to look at things as rationally as possible.  I didn't realize this sub has shifted to full on IF YOU DON'T 100 PERCENT BELIEVE IN EVERY THEORY YOU ARE A SHILL.  </p>
<p>I'm trying to approach much of this with an Occam's razor mindset, and some of it seems that it can potentially have explanations, other things make no sense in any context.  But you're absolutely right, for trying to look at all angles I am just a fucking CTR.  Guess I'll go hang out with tardbasher and buy an Apes album on vinyl.   </p></p>

        <p><p>Razor mindset would say that sketches alone put them as suspects #1 and #2.</p>
<p>No other evidence need be provided, as they eerily and obviously match those sketches.</p>
<p>You could argue, even with the razor mindset, that at this point, the amount of disinfo, censorship and recent history of information obtained via independent research. That the amount of confusion, number of false leads, etc. within the original investigation, create something murky enough to fit into what has been recently uncovered.</p>
<p>The Mccann's themselves were tied to a number of higher ups in the UK gov. The UK gov that was implicated in pedophilia related activities...</p></p>

        <p><p>Thank you. I tried to make this argument a wee while ago elsewhere. My memories of Madelaines dispearance are very vivid. It was on the news very night. Definitely there were reports that there was more the one person involved. Definitely there was speculation about two men and a woman. The bottom line is that no one knows. In the event that there has been a cover up, keep in mind the one man argument has turned up nothing, it is so important that other scenarios be considered. People asked if they recall seeing one man are not going to say, no but I did see three. All possibilities have to be on the table.</p>
<p>I have never believed just one man was involved. </p></p>
