        <strong>Maybe something? Not sure what to think.</strong>
        <p><p>First post here, bear with me if this info is already up:</p>
<p>So whole chan has this [thread] (https://8ch.net/pol/res/8278810.html) which appears to be a copy pasta of all the contacts &amp; coordinates from the lhohq site. </p>
<p>Out of curiosity, I plugged ~a dozen coordinates (which were not military installations) from my state into maps &amp; found some curious coincidences. Each point was near either a small airport, or within roughly 1000 feet of railroad tracks. Two of these locations (possibly more) are government facilities which sit adjacent to tracks, though most appeared to be street corners, parking lots, or empty lots. Two appear to be private residences. While one of those sits a block or so away from the tracks, the other didn't appear to be super close to anything like the rest. There is a small airport a few miles away; however, this particular residence is directly across the street from another private home which houses a music program for "foster &amp; at-risk youth."</p>
<p>To me, these coordinates seem to represent waypoints within a network. The fact that every one (with one very notable exception) is near <em>but not quite at</em> specific means of transportation is very interesting.  </p>
<p>Any thoughts on this? </p></p>

        <p><p>a police officer some time back made a map of missing childrens and plotted them out:

<p>here is a conspiracy theory on how it coordinates with underground military bases:

<p>but i do agree on how they network, investigating these kind of places(childcare etc etc) near escape routes is a pretty good idea</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm really not sure what I'm looking at, thb. I feel like these could be meeting points for low-profile transport. I mean, you wouldn't take a stolen kid through a major airport or anything, but a small airfield for private planes or perhaps a train could be a viable way move victims around without being seen. The coordinates I looked at form something of a grid along the major thoroughfares in my state. </p></p>

        <p><p>Lhohq site has been removed from the body of evidence, as it has been around for years and pretty thoroughly investigated- it's just absurdist garbage at best and a malicious honeypot at worst. </p></p>
