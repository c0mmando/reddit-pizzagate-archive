        <strong>The Trojan Gambit</strong>
        <p><p>It's a simple but effective gambit. We know how hard a lot of people resist any type of information that rattles their view of the world so significantly. They will resist looking at it with every urge in their body. If we just mean to do the usual campaign and hope that slowly we build enough momentum it just gives the people behind this more time to adapt and implement their own strategies to further divide and discredit the movement to get this scandal out in the open.</p>
<p>So we literally have to trick people into being exposed to it. We're thinking about the type of people who simply never see anything like this except in their peripheral vision and who would never look at a link if it had anything remotely connected to what we are actually talking about in the title. </p>
<p>The CTR have learned how to deal with subs such as this one and movements have had momentum before without ever reaching a the breakthrough necessary to get justice (and in this case, save the victims still in danger) we can not simply let them fight us the way they are used to because they already know how to do that.</p>
<p>And since they immediately jump on anything pizzagate related with bans, downvote brigading and the usual abuse in the comment section, we should make their jobs a little more difficult.</p>
<p>So basically just create a throwaway account and go to any random subreddit. Post a video, blog or an infochart or whatever you feel is most compelling but make the title into something completely different.</p>
<p>"Cat looks suspicious of pizza guy, scares the shit out of him!" "Incredible frisby shot!" "Study shows teenagers drink more alcohol than people over 40" or whatever crap comes to mind, just as long as it gets clicks. </p>
<p>Sure, the moderators will remove them quickly but once more and more of these start popping up they will soon become overwhelmed. Seeing that they are human they will struggle to keep up with it. At any rate they should at least start to get curious why so many people are doing this. The people who will inevitably also surf across some of this will initially be like "this is not labelled right? what is this?!"</p>
<p>Sure, some will be put off by this and use it against us whatever but guess what. Those people are already put off by this. The debate about whether the tactic is "ethical" and the predictable abuse that will be showered at those behind it from those having to deal with cleaning it up is bound to create a lot of attention that can hopefully be redirected to the evidence in this case.</p>
<p>I have a feeling this idea will get attacked in the comments but I am pretty sure that most of that will be from CTR that will attempt to dissuade us from doing this cause they will realize that they would not now how to deal with it.</p>
<p>To put a stop to it they would have to fundamentally change the way reddit works, like f.e. banning throwaway account and any move like that would create far too much attention to this for their liking.</p>
<p>So I don't suppose there is any reason to wait for a consensus. If you like the idea go ahead and try it. If you don't like the idea don't do it but I'm telling you, right now we need as much attention to this as possible as quickly as possible. If enough of us do this we could also combine to upvote all of these trojan links we are posting, making them much more visible to the general population. </p>
<p>Similar ideas can also be used on twitter. I'm not really much of a twitter user but I imagine you could try to hijack popular hashtags? So like #pizzagate #whateveristrending? </p>
<p>Youtube video makers could also make videos with disguised titles and people could share those on their facebook.</p>
<p>Also, if they do something stupid like banning this subreddit it will only make more people suspicious.</p>
<p>Beyond that it is also important to post information that is indirectly related to this, but not disguising these posts. Such as the documentary "conspiracy of silence" that made the top of r/documentaries and created a lot of talk about pizzagate. Any time we see stuff like this at other big subreddits we should be trying to comment and upvote as well.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? What about you CTR people? What does your manual say?</p>
<p>Tl;dr - Make throwaway accounts, post pizzagate links on other subs in disguise as something else, watch chaos ensue, engage people in the debate and explain why this was tactic was deemed justified and necessary</p></p>

        <p><p>yeah another idea is simply to take a link to something (archive.is it) - a good summary...then make a random thread title (e.g. go back 1-2 months and literally COPY AND PASTE your opening message as something). so people will still think its on topic etc. </p></p>
