        <strong>Can we please permanently remove and ban all pictures of pizza from this subreddit, including the current picture at the top?</strong>
        <p><p>Just the other day, we had pizzas for upvotes and downvotes and the community wanted it removed since it was perceived as some sick joke.</p>
<p>I was hoping we could do the same with the pizza in the header subreddit picture and hopefully also make a <strong>subreddit rule</strong> to not show any actual pictures of pizza.</p>
<p>remember, paedophilia is no joke. making a pun out of a some sicko's desired terminology just makes it disgusting.</p></p>

        <p><p>pizza in the image makes it look like a ridiculous meme.  just have the girl's sillouette, and the capitol building.  maybe a gate.  it doesn't have to be a rebus puzzle.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think it's necessary for marketing purposes of this investigation, no matter how serious this is. The public obviously doesn't care about seriousness...</p>
<p>I'm not sure, you can correct me if you disagree, but I think this is how one enters the pizza gate:</p>
<p>1.) Hmm... there's a funny meme circulating, oh it's about Clintons and Pizza? Haha what is it.
2.) Eh, Podesta, Comet Ping Pong, James Alefantis what the fuck? This has so much too it.
3.) -Finished reading. Holy shit.... this is all happening.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is right, but how else would we get people reading this?</p></p>
