        <strong>Trump 60 Minutes Interview</strong>
        <p><p>http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x51vj3y </p>
<p>Trump gave the impression that he is not going to prosecute Hillary after all the rhetoric. To not prosecute after everything we have dug up seems criminal. We need to get louder. We need to be heard. We must not let this go away. Think of the children. Fuck I'm pissed.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Obama can currently pardon Hillary and Crew without ever pressing charges. Trump needs to bide his time.</p></p>

        <p><p>If you paid attention to the video, he kept repeating, "I don't want to hurt them." when he was asked about putting a special prosecutor onto Hillary.</p>
<p>This is a code, pedes. Why would he say <em>them</em> when the question was about Hillary? Why not say <em>her</em>?</p>
<p>Because he's talking about the victims.</p>
<p>Also he said he'd give a "good, definitive answer the next time (he) did 60 minutes". He's keeping his cards close to his chest. The pardon issue is very real.</p></p>
