        <p><p><a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/january2006/010106sexslavescandal.htm">Cynthia McKinney has fought US government ties to human trafficking for over a decade</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On March 11th 2005, McKinney grilled Secretary Rumsfeld and General Myers on the Dyncorp scandal.</p>
<p>"Mr. Secretary, I watched President Bush deliver a moving speech at the United Nations in September 2003, in which he mentioned the crisis of the sex trade. The President called for the punishment of those involved in this horrible business. But at the very moment of that speech, DynCorp was exposed for having been involved in the buying and selling of young women and children. While all of this was going on, DynCorp kept the Pentagon contract to administer the smallpox and anthrax vaccines, and is now working on a plague vaccine through the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program. Mr. Secretary, is it [the] policy of the U.S. Government to reward companies that traffic in women and little girls?"</p>

        <p><p>Sorry for not being more clear. That's how I read that email. I assume they are talking about the materials for making hot dogs and pizza. I'm fine being wrong, I just know from experience that conspiracies are almost always misunderstandings about something that may be heinous but isn't being covered up.</p></p>

        <p><p>It ALWAYS can be a coincidence. Just doesn't seem likely if everything else is true. And that sounds like a lot of hot dogs and pizza </p></p>

        <p><p>It certainly seems like it could be code. But it's almost assuredly something straightforward. It seems like people are filling in gaps in reasoning themselves in order to connect dots that aren't there. The facts don't seem to be there at all.</p></p>

        <p><p>You can also try to speculate the cost of it based on google search.</p>
<p>I don't know what kind of plane they used but judging from the cost of a  private Jet from Chicago to DC that's about 8k-26k.</p>
<p>Now let's say they used a private airliner, that is 26k, They said they paid 65k, let's assume they decided to give a tip to the senders because of how much they asked for the hot dogs and pizza.</p>
<p>Now you gotta roll back a little bit and consider, how much pizza/hot dogs can you get for that much money. I wanna play it a little loose so I will just say average pizza is 18 and per hot dog, going by Nathan's 3.15, let's say 4 dollars per hot dog. </p>
<p>So you have 4 dollars per person and then 18 for a suspected 4 per pizza, with 2 slices each, of course give and take. Starting at 39k now cause of cost of private airline let's say they did enough for half of each. Let's assume 36k in half for 18k worth of hot dogs and pizza with the other 3k as tip for the services.</p>
<p>So how many pizza and hot dogs are we getting with 18k each?</p>
<p>For Pizza at 18k assuming the average cost is 18, they are getting 1000 pizzas, enough to feed 4000 if they all eat 2 slices each.</p>
<p>As for Hot Dogs 4500, enough to feed same number if they all eat 1 each.</p>
<p>Truth be told, looking at it from these numbers of how much that money actually gets you, the cost is a bit believable, however now the real question comes in.</p>
<p>Can the White House support 4k-6k people within in?</p>
<p>A family can be considered 4-6, so the guest rooms account for about 64-96 people. </p>
<p>132 rooms, not sure if that counts the 16 guest room, might so minus guest rooms, 3 kitchens and 35 bathrooms we're left with 78 rooms of varying size.</p>
<p>Would be easier to find occupancy size for White House or something but I can't even find out a  number or how many invited etc etc. But if we go by 78 and let's say 50 guest per room. That's about 3900. So even though the cost to fly Pizza and Hot Dogs does seem a bit odd, the math suggest that is is a bit believable however it's also possible to suggest that the price was potentially done in a way to make the trip look believable. </p>
<p>So it's honestly 50/50, it can be a coincidence as the math shows that is a potential truth to the cost of flying pizza and hot dogs from Chicago however it's also possible they planned for someone to do the math and specifically made it where the cost would be the same.</p></p>

        <p><p>Do they ever have outdoor events at the White House? Doesn't seem like they would unless it was a public event but that may be possible too making the size of the White House not even as relevant</p></p>

        <p><p>Ok, that sort of makes sense, but I mean I assume that Obama is just flying in the actual materials and the food is being prepared at the White House. Sure, I'm sure there is more I'm not seeing but a lot of times stuff like this winds up being really straightforward stuff, like weapons or other ways of undermining democracy. Anyway, thanks.</p></p>

<p>Fun picture I found looking into 9/11 conspiracies... someone in official capacity investigating airline crashes thought this was important enough to photograph and save...</p>
<p>Now ya know how the Pizza Hut dudes became billionaires in such a short time... and why they are so into Big Brothers, Big Sisters and the Red Cross. </p>
<p>This is where the code pizza and hot dogs originated from. </p></p>

        <p><p>Trump has links to Epstein too. He praised him in a Vanity Fair article back in the mid 2000's "I've known Jeffrey for 15 years. Terrific guy. He likes beautiful women as much as I know, some says he likes them on the younger side. Definitely, Jeffrey enjoys his social life." Or something like that. Epstein pled the fifth about anything Clinton related and then did the same for Trump. </p>
<p>Trump is just less of a sickfuck, it seems like. But Trump was a Democrat in the past, only became an R because he could face Clinton. Had Bernie not been rigged out of 11 states by Clinton, we'd be talking of President Elect Sanders, he was beating them in any vs. polls until he was screwed and likely beaten up the second his secret service security was removed, while there was still one day at the DNC convention.</p>
<p>I'm sad to say the real Democrats, the progressive anti-war and the classic social injustice thing without money attached only represent about 25% max of the Democrats now. RIP Sen. Paul Wellstone, a definite kill back in 2002 by TPTSNB. It had to be the longest running Independent Senator in US history to galvanize the real left which is not your enemy, and of course, it was rigged, hell the DNC even say so, when that guy Sean...blanking on his last name the process server who went and delivered the suit against the DNC (from within) and found dead the same night...later on the DNC had the fucking galls to say that Sandercrats knew the process was rigged so their lawsuit has no standing. That happened last month or 2 ago, too busy to find the link. Check up Niko House for more info.</p></p>

        <p><p>Perhaps Trump found out what was going on and decided to take them down. Or maybe he's part of the kiddy diddling circle. </p>
<p>We'll see by January, I suppose. If this pedoring isn't fully convicted under his presidency, he'll just have to be charged eventually for covering it up as well.</p></p>

        <p><p>The good thing is that if you take down a few on the left one is all but guaranteed to sing like a canary.</p>
<p>We can hope at least, no good only cutting off half of the hydra's heads.</p></p>
