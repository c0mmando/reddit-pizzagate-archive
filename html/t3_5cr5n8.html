        <strong>Has anyone here been to Comet Pizza?</strong>
        <p><p>I've read a lot of claims about the place, like unsupervised children running around, naked murals in the bathrooms, the room that doesn't allow you to have your phone on, and I was hoping someone here who lives in the area could stake the place out and get us more evidence.</p></p>

        <p><p>I would wait and see honestly. With how much this is picking up and many users living near the place, I'm sure someone has/will visit soon. Tbh though, that should've been done much sooner cause they would know to hide anything suspicious now.</p></p>
