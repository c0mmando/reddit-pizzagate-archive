        <strong>I've found the origin and story of Pizza.jpg</strong>
        <p><p>Look, you're not gonna like this. I was tempted not to even post this, because it throws a massive spanner in the whole pizzagate theory. But, I'm not gonna keep it to myself. Please dont downvote this just because it goes against the current theory.</p>
<p>https://conservativedailypost-guvbvzsunddro8yrw.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pizza.jpg</p>
<p>The two women and girl in Pizza.jpg are Euna Lee and Laura Ling.
On March 17, 2009 they were captured in North Korea.</p>
<p><strong>please read this: http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126613763</strong></p>
<p>As you can see, they were captured in North Korea. "Clinton made the trip in August 2009, after Laura and Euna had spent 140 days in captivity, and helped secure their release."</p>
<p><strong>watch this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgbXLWZtv0Y </strong></p>
<p>It's them, and the exact same girl. Aka, her daughter. This was in <strong>August 2009</strong></p>
<p>Now look at the pizza.jpg email:</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/8673</p>
<p>The date posted, August 2009. This was taken almost immediately after they were rescued.</p>
<p>"It doesn't get any better than this" is referencing the fact they've been rescued, re-united and eating pizza together.</p>
<p>The timing with the stories, and the email, to me alteast, debunks the suspicious meaning behind pizza.jpg.</p>
<p>ps: I'm not a shill, was just researching to find evidence to support Pizzagate, but ended up finding this instead</p></p>

<p>Ok then. Fact is man, I've not seen anything about this posted here. So, what's the harm in clearing it up.</p></p>

        <p><p>Whether or not anyone agrees or disagrees with your conclusions is irrelevant. We need people objectively reviewing the data (old or new) to avoid the echo-chamber effect. </p>
<p>Challenging any narrative is important. Maybe your findings debunk, or maybe they reinforce.</p>
<p>Good work, if anybody else hasn't told you so.</p></p>

        <p><p>I apologize if I'm missing something obvious, but where do you see something resembling a QR code? The small square slightly to the right of the center is the best guess I have, but even then I think it's a stretch. I tried to scan it but it didn't pick up anything.</p></p>

<p>actually look into it.
All what happened is, the letters pk showed up..that's it. 
Nothing else happened in all those threads.</p>
<p>"I think it's bullshit.</p>
<p>The bytes on the left pane don't look like they come from the pizza.jpg file, the bytes highlighted in yellow are NOT present in the file.</p>
<p>The file on the left IS pizza.jpg, but the thing being highlighted isn't a ZIP archive, since the "PK" marker needs to be followed by three bytes of value 3, 4 and 0x14.</p>
<p>Which is the case on the right, but not on the left, and the right-pane is bullshit."</p></p>

        <p><p>OP, your hypothesis doesn't explain why Bill Clinton himself went out there, why these women were working on child trafficking, why they flew on an Epstein-connected private jet, why a photo of them eating pizza was taken, why it was named specifically "pizza.jpg," and why John Podesta made the remark "it doesn't get better than this."</p>
<p>The better explanation covers all of your data, as well as the data I mentioned above, and it is that these women were about to bust a trafficking ring, Clinton nabbed them and John Podesta was celebrating the irony of them eating pizza. </p>
<p>One way to verify all of this would be to contact the reporters and ask what they were onto, ask them if they know about the "pizza" terminology, and to compare notes with them.</p>
<p>But last I heard, they are missing. </p></p>

        <p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>true, but that makes sense within the context of actually just being pizza.</p>
<p>Aka
"Wanna come round for an hour and eat pizza?"</p>
<p>Unless he actually has an handkerchief with a map on it...with pizzas or something, the other email is more confusing.</p>
<p>I've been looking into it, there are handkerchiefs with actual literal  maps on them</p>

        <p><p>I was thinking that the dominos guy was just trying to make a witty remark saying he might play dominos better on (after having eaten) pasta than after having eaten pizza. Like dominos is their after-dinner game. Could be the actual game, or could be a bunch of sexual innuendos. Don't really know.</p></p>

        <p><p>The massive web of soft links being made here, and the whole show of this election are undeniably giving massive credibility to what conspiracy theorists have been saying for decades now.  We are reaching a time at the end of the information era where the public is starting to know what actually happens behind closed doors in Washington, and it's going to be ugly and world changing.  I was extremely skeptical of all of these subjects before the Podesta leaks, but the large-scale connections made in these leaks is making it blatantly obvious.</p>
<p>The code talk is doing it's job, plausible deniability.</p></p>

        <p><p>pizza.jpg has definitely been modified from the original photo, but none of my tools are able to determine if it contains hidden files. However I can confirm that typically .Jpg's are not used to hide files, as .png or .bmp have broader support for stenography.  </p>
<p>I'm still working on the PNG that was posted. Will report back once I'm home and have access to my full suite of forensic tools.</p></p>

        <p><p>What about the one where someone says Podesta gave them pasta for Christmas and them using it 'now' (in March)?</p>
<p>And the one about the squared pizza box (cheese vs pasta) and the dominos (pasta/pizza)?</p></p>

        <p><p>OP: it is <strong>because of that trip to North Korea</strong> the whole thing becomes more interesting. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pedosta <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/56939">was a member</a> of the delegation to North Korea (not in any official role, acting for the "Center for American Progress")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clinton and his "delegation" flew to North Korea on Steve Bing's Boeing 737. Steve Bing is <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5axyn9/yesterday_i_broke_a_story_about_the_clintons/">tied</a> to Epstein and the pedoring. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of his official remarks, Clinton oddly <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/56939">said</a> that during the official arrival ceremony at the airport a few hours earlier, he had received a "beautiful bouquet of flowers from an even more beautiful little North Korean child". Asian women brought into sex trafficking <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sex+trafficking+flowers#xxri=0">have been called</a> "flowers" before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add to that the coincidence of a child eating cheese pizza with the 2 rescued "journalists", you understand why it is interesting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not unreasonable to hypothesize Clinton/Podesta/Bing brought back "orphan" children from NK on that jumbo jet, nor is it impossible to suggest these 2 "journalists" were sent by the Clintons to harvest children in China or NK before getting caught.</p>
<p>EDIT: oh and the two "journalists" were admittedly "investigating human trafficking" when they got caught</p></p>

        <p><p>It is not a "massive spanner" to pizza gate and moreover doesn't debunk anything, even this tangential tendril of the conspiracy...there's an exoteric and an esoteric meaning to this email and the picture, as was made clear by the other sloppy emails that neglected to keep exoteric form intact.</p></p>

        <p><p>The way that I've interpreted this is that they were investigating child trafficking and were close to the truth. The satisfaction of seeing them back and eating pizza is from the feeling of dodging a bullet. </p></p>

        <p><p>OK so what happened to them after that?</p>
<p>I'd track em and make sure they're safe. If they vanished, I'd keep digging. </p>
<p>Dont assume they havent been victimized just because they're known about and accounted for before the picture was taken.</p></p>

        <p><p>Sorry, no. It's more than that.</p>
<p>They USE these people who are supposed to be helping child trafficking to do the child trafficking for them. </p>
<p>These women are in on it. You wouldn't say things like 'thank god the're safe'? You think 'it doesn't get any better than this' and a pic of them all eating pizza is a normal reaction to that scenario?</p>
<p>I don't buy it. </p></p>

        <p><p>Ok, let me play devils advocate.
You say "thank god they're safe", when they're safe, or when meeting them, not 5 days after they are safe.</p>
<p>The scenario is, they all met and hung out with each other.
The email says</p>
<p>"As John said, it doesn't get any better than this"</p>
<p>aka, John Podesta said that beforehand, probably during the time the picture was taken. Aka, they were relaxing eating pizza, the two women were saved.</p>
<p><strong>takes sip of beer with pizza and friends/family</strong>
"It doesnt get better than this."</p>
<p>They probably took that picture, and was sending the next day to look back on the good time they had.</p>

<p>I don't doubt this as a possibility, I just think the 'good time' they had isn't just sitting around for pizza and beer. </p></p>
