        <p><p>circlebroke subreddits are also actively working to keep pizzagate down.  They use the same strategy of simply calling it a stupid hoax in a couple of sentences.  They also like to point to the stupid pizzagate shill threads where shills have posted way-out-there conspiracy nonsense.</p></p>

        <p><p>snopes launched a "research in progress" page about pizzagate. Anyway to get in contact with them? I'm not sure what kind of research they do, but could offer more resources.</p></p>

        <p><p>What they're doing is stalling for the government approved narrative, then they'll propagate it. I'm sure there are ways to contact them, however you're just wasting your time and they will dismiss or ignore your information as sure as the sun will be out tomorrow.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, but I don't think there's going to be any retractions and this was pretty thought out and vicious. If you listen to his show, Rivero regularly dismisses ANY and all Hollywood paedophilia as well as anything related to satanic cults. He will also meet anyone bringing up "Fake Moon Landings" or "Chemtrails" with aggressively hostile reactivity and utter dismissal.</p>
<p>His self-confessed background was that he worked in NASA and Hollywood as a special effects man, so his "forbidden" topics are the sacred cows he is actively protecting by dismissal, ridicule or omission.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm a regular listener to his show and unfortunately he gets stuff wrong. Problem is that he is so stupidly pigheaded that he refuses to admit mistakes unless it hits him in the face. He's an odd character with a huge ego.</p></p>
