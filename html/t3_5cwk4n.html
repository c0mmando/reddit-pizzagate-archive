        <p><p>I'm quite sure that at the top level that kind of shit is the pervading culture. So it's not about blackmailing SomeOneJust it's about everyone is in that club and they bring new members into the club by getting them to join or compromising them, preferably both. It's just how they establish control</p></p>

        <p><p>I mean, no decent person would agree to be in something like that, let alone be so enthusiastic about it like the stuff on ig and facebook. But it certainly makes sense for powerful individuals to at least keep tabs on those kind of "clubs". </p></p>

        <p><p>I think a large majority of people who desire that amount of power have a certain pathology, I don't think they keep tabs on them I think they are in them</p></p>
