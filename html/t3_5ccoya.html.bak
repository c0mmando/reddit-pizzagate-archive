<p><strong>Teflon Tony Rodham</strong>
Anthony Dean "Tony" Rodham is an American consultant and businessman who is the youngest brother of former First Lady, Senator, and Secretary of State, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the brother-in-law of former U.S. President Bill Clinton. His business dealings have sometimes appeared to take advantage of his connections to the Clintons.</p>

After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Rodham proposed a $22 million deal to rebuild homes in the country which would be funded by the Clinton Foundation. The project didn't actually happen, and the Clinton Foundation claimed that it wasn't involved and had no knowledge of the plan. - https://www.bustle.com/articles/143786-who-is-tony-rodham-hillary-clintons-brother-his-forays-into-politics-havent-quite-worked-out </li>
