        <strong>Just a question, but Podesta also talked a lot about "aliens". Should we be looking into that?</strong>
        <p><p>I remember when the emails were first coming out and we all saw the pizza/food ones and just thought they were random. I also remember people laughing about the alien emails as well. I don't have any new evidence about this, but considering how the "random" food emails aren't so random with new information, would it be worth our time to take a look at the "alien" emails again?</p>
<p>EDIT: For the less intelligently inclined out there, what I'm obviously saying is that it's possible he wasn't literally talking about alien life from outer space, but perhaps this was another way of being able to talk "in code", much like we are seeing with the pizza language.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Here's an email were they discuss "disclosure" and "Zero Point Energy": https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1766</p>
<p>EDIT 3: And another email: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1802</p>
<p>Unless there is actually a secret space war going on, I'm going to say these are codes.</p></p>

        <p><p>Sounds like it is common to stage fake stuff like alien abductions, "plays" etc as part of the mind control as well as to cover up the actual abuse knowing talk of aliens would lead people to not believe the accusations </p></p>

        <p><p>I agree with the common trick analysis.  Also that </p>
<p>Though my thought is that if you are looking for an international child trafficking ring involving the military industrial complex try googling "MILAB"</p></p>

        <p><p>no issue with talking about them, but they aren't relevant in this subreddit (at least not yet). you should keep it in r/conspiracy unless someone finds a link between these two things. </p>
<p>also, the people sending these emails aren't people like podesta or people in powers of position. it's other people emailing podesta (i know some of them you can google their email address and find the website where they publicly talk about the same things they email to podesta).</p></p>

        <p><p>Makes as much sense as the rest as what he's done. Could be?</p>
<p>Maybe it stands for Illegal Alien or some such? it would make sense that they would be the most victimized since they aren't supposed to be in the US any way.</p></p>

        <p><p>I understand that...Doesn't change anything. Also, podesta is one of the biggest proponents of disclosure.  That said, I still think this is an excuse to talk in code. Unless, you know...there's actually a secret space war with aliens.</p></p>
