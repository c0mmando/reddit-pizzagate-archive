        <p><p>We are trying very hard to prevent this sort of witch-hunt.  So far, in my mind, this whole pizzagate thing has simply pointed out some distasteful jokes/social media accounts.  I don't think anyone here feels like they have definitive proof.  People are collecting information, sharing, and making connections.  How is this comparable?    </p></p>

        <p><p>I am with you there, but we can't even be certain they aren't intentionally doing this.  That is the surest way to lose the movement's credibility.  When I was younger I used to see these same types of conspiracies rehashed again and again.  I now have a natural aversion to jumping down these rabbit holes too far.  The difference between all of that stuff, and pizzagate is that it is happening real-time, in conjunction with wiki-leaks, and unprecedented level of information sharing, and a (seemingly) massive power shift in Washinton.  There is clearly disarray in the FBI and the DOJ.  There are so many moving parts, but with so many eyes on it I hope that we can provide a coherent account of the abuse we suspect is going on.  </p>
<p>At the very least, their is no denying that there were distasteful images and comments, that any one interested in their PR should have gotten rid of in order to purvey a family restaurant.  I don't see the harm in exposing that these restaurateurs and artists were so cavalier with their innuendo, nor do I see a problem with digging deeper to their connections in Washington.  How is a pizza parlor owner so powerful?  If that article about Alefantis is true, how can he hold more sway than say, the CEO of Dominos?  We are not wrong for being skeptical about his rise to power.  The whole thing stinks.</p>
<p>As long as people keep their eye on the objective, to prevent children from being hurt, or otherwise, we can avoid an issue like the Boston Bomber incident.  There will always be some idiot either intentionally or unintentionally losing our credibility.</p></p>

        <p><p>Alright documentary. Just felt like everyone they interviewed was trying to avoid taking any blame.</p></p>

        <p><p>Oh yea, definitely. If I could tweak that little--it didn't seem to me that most were <em>actively</em> trying to avoid taking blame, it was more that it had never even occurred to them that they might be even just a little bit at fault.</p>
<p>I've seen things like this unfold, both on reddit &amp; elsewhere. One notable incident involved OP making a suicide threat. Each of the dozens of people who wanted to help meant well. But the way that played out in reality was that they tracked down the (wrong, I might add) social media accounts of OP and started bombarding not-even-the-right-guy's friends with messages saying OMG your friend is about to kill himself! They'd made dozens of calls to police stations and businesses they thought he frequented. Among other things. It was a complete shitshow.  </p>
<p>It's that cumulative action that turns it into a nightmare for a lot of innocent people. Cracked (iirc) has a good interview with one of the parents from Sandy Hook. Years later, the guy still gets hateful &amp; harassing phone calls from internet sleuths. This is a growing problem.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well put. It was definitely a difficult thing to handle. If it didn't happen on Reddit, chances are it would of happened somewhere else.</p></p>
