        <strong>ALERT: JACK DORSEY THE SATANIC VERSES IS DISINFO</strong>
        <p><p>Hi guys, i'm a contributor to this sub, not a shill. Check my history.</p>
<p>We're looking for factual evidence that is known, documented, and published. Evidence that can not be easily discredited and spun around into some story. With enough evidence like that there will be no more room for censors to make up a story or deny it.</p>
<p>This tweet by Jack Dorsey below is verified to be a witchhunt/disinfo. Using this as argument will only further hurt our case. Even if the book's contents is suspicious and has a very interesting history.</p>

        <p><p>I'm confused. It is or it isn't a real twitter post of his?</p></p>

        <p><p>This is his twitter post. However, this is weak circumstantial evidence at best and can be easily discredited.</p>

        <p><p>Agreed. Was just thrown off by the use of the word disinfo, but I understand what you mean now. That book doesn't really even seem to have much to do with the occult.</p></p>

        <p><p>LOL. Please refrain from using CAPS ALERT DISINFO.  <br>
Ofc everybody knew he was talking about S.Rushdie's book. The wording of his tweet and the potential hidden meaning is still worth of note.</p></p>

        <p><p>Because you're crowding out good posts. <br>
And you make people here look stupid as if they needed that to learn about Rushdie's book. It's not disinfo, it's you just learning about a very famous author.</p></p>

        <p><p>Lmao. This post isnt even upvoted that much. Not even on the new page. And this account has been responsible for many top posts so clearly someone cares.</p></p>

        <p><p>Good for you mate. I never intended to discourage you from disseminating the good stuff.<br>
I lurk rising/new looking for "discoveries" and was slightly annoyed by your post. No hard feelings.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's all good. I'm sorry if there was any rudeness there. I'm slightly agitated by people who don't even want to any read evidence. Sorry for projecting on you.</p></p>
