        <strong>You had me and then you lost me...</strong>
        <p><p>You know when pizzagate lost its legitimacy for me? When it pointed out the art for shows at comet pizza (and some other art pieces enjoyed by the people in question) and noted "Okay so at very best, these are very odd, Satanic type people." </p>
<p>I've created and looked at much stranger art than that. At best I'm someone that frequents Reddit, at worst I find boundary pushing art to be interesting.  </p></p>

        <p><p>If it lost you at artwork, you haven't looked enough. There are very legitimate links to the DoJ, other high ranking officials, and a giant spiderweb among owners of children-oriented business.</p></p>

        <p><p>The problem Sarah, is that when you sick fucks hide in plain sight, then it's <em>impossible</em> to hide again. Can't be done. Right now the onus is on you to prove that you know nothing about this. Because we know you've associated with Jay-Z for <em>years</em>. We know you regularly rub shoulders with the elite. And your art is "odd and Satanic." In the current state of our investigations that sort of personal profile raises many red flags.</p>
<p>By the way. thanks for the <a href="http://archive.is/MEffU/cc68578ffb519415e9508de122fb49870830ac5d.jpg">suggestion</a>. We'll be getting right on it. </p></p>

        <p><p>CNN is also owned by one of the people in question. http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2011/05/11/dont-hear-george-soros-ties-30-major-news-organizations.html</p>
<p>He was also forced to collaborate with the Nazi's. On the same hand: if he hadn't done so the fellow Jews he had sold out would not have died. That would be enough guilt to mess anyone up. </p></p>

        <p><p>You don't get it, do you? In just the last few days millions of man hours of work has been done connecting the dots on a large DC-based pedophile ring. Many famous people are directly involved. Donald Trump is perfectly aware of all this by the way: his speech at the Al Smith dinner called out Hillary directly for child-trafficking in Haiti. When all of this is exposed, you don't want to be anywhere near it. It's going to send shockwaves throughout the world. If Jay-Z or any other of your celebrity clients are involved in any way at all, then don't be surprised if you're burned at the stake with them. </p></p>

        <p><p>You're a fucking idiot. Millions of MAN HOURS. See what I wrote there? Man hours are the number of hours multiplied by the number of people. Estimates are that roughly half a million people around the world on social media are chasing this down. After just a week half a million multiplied by a few hours of research each adds up to ... millions of man hours.</p></p>

        <p><p>You didn't just know Jay-Z, you posted an IAMA where you described in detail how much time you spent with him. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ozxlw/iama_woman_who_was_once_considered_one_of_the/">Remember</a>? You were once one of the most influential music promoters in the world. That brought you in direct contact with the elite as part of your day to day job. We know Jay-Z is a fan of Marina Abramovic and that means you're going to get a lot of guilt by association whether you like it or not. And there's other stuff: posting pictures of babies to /r/me_irl and your obsession with pizza. These could be completely innocent or perhaps not. We don't know</p>
<p>FWIW, having just read your entire timeline, I've changed my mind. You're probably not involved with these people, you're just dumb as a box of bricks. Nevertheless my advice stands: run as far away from these people as possible.</p></p>

        <p><p>I can't say it isn't alarming to suddenly have this stuff thrust onto your doorstep without realizing it was in the neighborhood. The good news is, it is not the majority of people like some nuts are freaking out about. But they do want to implicate you in their schemes so they can control you etc. At some point, you will have enough capital to satisfy your goals in life... Before they let that happen, they will lock in this other method of control as best as possible. Your success in that kind of career will hinge on how well you become imprinted. God is near, turn away from that which isn't.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm on the fence.</p>
<p>I think something is up with Pedesta because of the emails. I think there have been way too many coincidences. But now it's getting to the point where every triangle means illuminati confirmed.</p>
<p>If there is something, it's not getting proven beyond a reason of a doubt. People are way too focused on past cases. This was off to a great start, but you can see gears shifting and things moving. Whoever would be behind something this big they would of moved everything by now and switched shit around. </p>
<p>Only law enforcement can solve this one, and there are ties to law enforcement in this so thats not gonna happen. </p></p>
