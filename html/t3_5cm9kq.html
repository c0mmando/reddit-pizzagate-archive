        <strong>Has anyone else noticed...</strong>
        <p><p>...that almost all of the children in the pictures shared by Jimmy Comet and his friends have a haunted look about them?  And big bags under their eyes?   Would it be so hard for these people to post a picture of a child that looks carefree and happy?   These children look like they have the weight of the world on their shoulders, exactly like you'd expect them to look if they were being abused by their "guardians."   When you combine the pictures with the over-the-top sexual references ("chickenlovers", "Baby...yum" -- WTF!) it is blatantly obvious what is going on here.   </p>
<p>If the Feds don't bust these monsters there is only one explanation: it goes all the way to the top.   In which case, we are in a whole world of trouble.   I have no doubt that the psychopaths at the top would literally start WWIII or release a genetically engineered virus rather than be exposed.      </p></p>

        <p><p>All of the kids look weirded out, frightened and naive as to what is occurring, or traumatized. Every single one. Even the infants. Look in the eyes. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yup, and that's after they're "forced" to smile for these pictures, their eyes tell the entire story. WW3 was pretty close, we'll see what other crazy shit they pull while Obama's still in office.</p></p>

        <p><p>Them being exposed is their greatest fear, we're gonna come to see how much of a lie everything was, our entire "history" was created by them, nuclear weapons probably don't even exist. </p></p>

        <p><p>It's because they are the same child at different ages. Pretty sure that at least 2 of the pics showing younger babies, are the same girl that is shown with her arms taped to the table. </p></p>

        <p><p>No I'm talking about multiple children of both sexes (though yes, some could be of the same child).   </p></p>

<p>That is what I thought as well. Referring to the photos posted by John Alefantis on instagram - the photos I'm talking about: one was a man holding a baby with the caption of "kiss," one was a baby biting a wad of cash, and the 3rd was the girl w/ arms taped to the table. I think those 3 pics are the same girl aka "caris"</p></p>
