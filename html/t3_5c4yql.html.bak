        <strong>The FbI ain't gonna do shit</strong>
        <p><p>So the FBI just covers shit up. They've habitually not looked into child trafficking, covered up for convicted pedophiles, and they're in the positions of power to make sure nobody gets caught. It's mutually insured destruction for these people. We're up against a wall thats been getting built upon for hundreds of years. No one can count on the FBI for help; they're only going to come after you. I hope all of you are computer savvy enough to not get caught, but please tread very carefully. This is what would bring down the government. And they're not gonna go down without a fight. You can't go to the media; Alex Jones is the best you have. Vice is some liberal puppet shit now, Same with NPR. But if you're smart enough to know that, you're smart enough to not go to them anyway.</p>
<p>Keep digging through VPNs and Tor, and don't show anyone your findings. Don't publish them anywhere on the Internet until the time is right; when you have constructed an airtight case where no lead is left unchecked. And once you're done, make a million hard copies and hand them out like Halloween candy. You're going to have to be your own press, and go directly for the people. convince everyone you give a copy to make a thousand copies and hand em out too.</p>
<p>our case is already getting watered down as its getting copied and pasted across the Internet. Proof is getting deleted; and people will be arrested and possibly bumped off in a bizarre tragedy. I wouldn't be surprised if I was one of them, and I haven't even dug very deep. But never lose sight that this is for the greater good; and what you're doing is going to go down in the history books as the greatest event of the 21st century. </p>
<p>Good luck, watch out, and never stop digging, Patriots. </p></p>

        <p><p>Please don't say Alex Jones is the best we have. Even if it's the truth it's just really sad to admit :o</p></p>
