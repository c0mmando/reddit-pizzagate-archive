        <p><p>Look into George Bush and Enron.  Pedophiles and corruption abound. - who the fuck would downvote this?  Dyncorp as well needs to be looked into.  Bush cronies involved there.  The Delta project also started in Dallas around the time Bush was discharged.  Bush endorsed Hillary.  Think about this people!</p></p>

        <p><p>The only ties he has to Epstein is that Epstein was a member of Trumps Mar A lago resort. And once Epstein was outted as a sick fuck, Trump ceased all ties to him.</p>
<p>The other thing is Epsteins black book. Which allegedly has Trumps name in it. But since Epstein was a member at Mar a lago and Trump was a well known guy it makes sense. Compound that fact with the fact that JE had many names in his book, some of which are not necessarily connected to the inner circle but some in there probably are.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well... the two (that i know of) women coming forward with charges  against Trump is was what I was getting at. You can do the research yourself it was well known, Trump has been implicated as much the rest of them. </p>
<p>I think EVERYONE involved should serve time in jail, if they are found guilty. </p></p>

        <p><p>Quoted from the article: U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee dismissed that case in May, ruling that Johnson's complaint didn't raise valid claims under federal law. Gee, an appointee of President Barack Obama, noted that the suit cited a criminal statute that doesn't give rise to civil damages and that the civil statute Johnson cited only applies to actions based on "race-based or class-based animus."</p>
<p>Another version of the suit was filed in federal court in June, but withdrawn in September after apparently never being served on the defendants.</p>
<p>So it's not bullshit, just filed wrong. and the second time? well the papers were never served.</p></p>
