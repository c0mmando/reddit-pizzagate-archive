        <strong>Anyone have experience with how the criminal justice system handles sexual abuse allegations involving minors?</strong>
        <p><p>A friend of mine has said her ex-husband sexually assaulted their 3 year old daughter. He was never convicted. No evidence of the abuse was collected when reported and none of the investigations led to an indictment. </p>
<p>Also, in the years since, therapists who have worked with this child absolutely refuse to testify. One therapist has even recommended reconciliation therapy. </p>
<p>By all appearances there is no justice for children who are assaulted and pizzagate unfortunately seems to verify that. </p></p>

        <p><p>This is true for victims of sexual assault of all ages unfortunately. Especially in cases where the people are married and the argument "but she is my wife so I can't rape her" is made. Absurd but somehow relevant.</p>
<p>Anyways sexual abuse allegations involving minors, the most experience I have of this is with reports through social services. They are supposed to do a thorough investigation into whether there is any evidence of the claim. Part of that should be talking with therapists of the child.</p>
<p>People can be subpoenaed to testify and face fines/be guilty of contempt of court if they don't show up. Also why would the therapist recommend reconciliation therapy if there is mention of sexual assault? That means the therapist must be convinced that nothing happened.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think a lot of therapists are not skilled enough to work with the victims.  Trust is a major issue and if reconciliation is on the table the victim may refrain from speaking out of fear the therapist will not believe them and/or tell the abuser leading to more abuse.</p></p>
