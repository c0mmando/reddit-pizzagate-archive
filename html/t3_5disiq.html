        <strong>We can control the narrative. Subreddit direction.</strong>
        <p><p>In the forthcoming post I am going to provide a succinct overview of where we are currently, what is going to happen next in the form of a timeline of events, and what we need to do as a subreddit to ensure the outcome we want. To give this post a sense of legitimacy I will provide a few details about myself, I graduated from a good University with a degree in PR. I graduated from a better University with a doctorate in Political Science. I have worked on a few campaigns. I am smart. </p>
<p><strong>Where we are now:</strong> Currently we are still digging up information, what we have so far is raw but usable. </p>
<p><strong>Where the pedos are now:</strong> The pedos are sitting on their thumbs terrified right now as more information comes out, their plan of action right now is some combination of a finger-cross that this gets laughed off and swept under the rug, and a covert campaign to that end. The reason that none of them has publicly addressed this yet is that they don't want to give it legitimacy by doing so. Instead they have fed their version of events (crazy alt-right conspiracy etc. etc.) to smaller publications (lower readership) who've published clickbait articles with titles that immediately discredit the scandal as a conspiracy theory. The reason they've done this is to control what people see as far as "news" goes when they look up pizzagate- they want people to see one of those article titles and stop their search there because "it's a ridiculous conspiracy theory fueled by right-wing hate".</p>
<p><strong>What the pedos will do next:</strong> As the scandal gains ground and traction, someone will be forced to address it, expect to see this "conspiracy theory" as the butt of jokes on John Oliver or Colbert in the next week. They will foolishly attempt to paint this as a half-baked right-wing conspiracy with the use of the typical buzzwords like racist, sexist, and bigot in an attempt to control the narrative and steal legitimacy. Expect us to be compared to 9/11 truthers and bigfoot hunters. </p>
<p><strong>What we need to do next:</strong> This is the most important part of this post, right now we have a leg up on the powers that be in that their hands are tied as far as PR goes by the fact that they don't want to address the scandal and grant it legitimacy if they don't absolutely have to. What we must do now (and FAST) is get the public on our side. The "how" part is easy, we must paint this scandal as something that transcends party lines (expect the issue to be marginalized as being entirely red to discredit it), we must show the American people that getting to the bottom of this is more important than their political views and that stopping the people who hurt kids and uncovering the truth about Podesta, Alefantis and his ilk is the morally correct thing to do. We must encourage people (that means you too) to share this scandal to everyone they know, framed as a scandal, not as a conspiracy. The easiest way to do this is with images: if someone can create an infographic or an easy to understand/powerful graphic explaining the situation, DO SO NOW (I recommend making use of the Podesta's uncanny resemblance to those police sketches and not bringing up the occult pedo symbolism which I believe will get us written off in the public eye. If we can sell the scandal to them off the bat, they will do more research themselves and see the symbolism anyway). We need something that can be shared on Facebook and other social media by good Samaritans that shows the scandal as being legitimate and not a conspiracy theory. If you know celebrities or anyone with a following, beg them to talk about it, beg them to make a call to action with regard to getting to the bottom of this. </p>
<p>Let me reiterate, we must act quickly if we want to control the narrative on this before the mainstream media (who are likely in the pockets of people who want this covered up) gets to it. If the mainstream media beats us to controlling the narrative we WILL be discredited, and they can't do that if the court of public opinion demands that this be addressed (we need that powerful image- think Kony 2012). We NEED to show that this is a scandal and not a conspiracy because Americans love scandals more than anything else on this earth. </p>
<p><strong>End Game:</strong> The end game of this is to make the ENTIRE American public aware of the scandal such that it cannot be written off or swept under the rug. If talking about it makes people in the media some money, then they will talk about it. If enough people start talking the hope is the launch of a formal investigation, and if everyone knows (and I mean fucking EVERYONE) the truth will be uncovered because whoever uncovers the truth stands to become very rich. Finally, if everyone knows then Podesta will be forced to address it.</p>
<p>DO NOT let this turn into a collective action problem where no one wants to take the first step toward getting people talking, the onus for sharing this information is on you, tell everyone. </p>
<p><strong>Dear Pedos</strong></p>
<p>I will now address the people that this post has terrified directly since we all know they'll be reading it. Hi guys and gals, this all is about to go as well for you as Hillary's war against the cartoon frog did for her. There are more of us than there are of you, we are smarter than you, we've learned from this election what you'll do and how you'll do it, and we are on the side of uncovering truth in scandal. You are fucked, and rightfully so.</p></p>

        <p><p>We need a really REALLY good video that will include all the images especially the graphic ones (and by all means the majestic ape videos, also someone needs to dig up up that video of naked Lady Gaga with Abramovic that i only once came across) and will respect the timeline of how we all got convinced this is big.</p>
<p>It shouls start with spirit cooking or maybe even earlier with the election scandal (Bernie and stuff), and then take us on a joirney of following the white rabbit trough the emails and through all the pictures.</p>
<p>Right now im struggling to find a really good convincing and interesting video to get people on board. Ive shown a lot of videos to people but none of them really stick.</p></p>

        <p><p>You've summarized everything (and a lot more) that concerns me about the state of this investigation. Everyone's fucking heads are so far up their asses with symbols, sprawling incorporations of really minor overlap, and corollary bullshit that they think any attempt to keep this thing on track is some conspiracy against them-- see the mod criticisms. How far have the other conspiracies gotten? Fucking nowhere. And it's because most conspiracy believers are dismissive of or incapable of strategic thought. They can't weigh concepts. It's all sensationalism. Now one lands right in our fucking lap and it's going to get ruined by simple idiots who can't rein in their imaginations. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah in all honesty dude I'm scared that not enough info will turn up in concert with the wackier stuff that we've uncovered so far. I'm scared that without direction we won't break the "wild conspiracy theory" label that's about to be slapped on this shit. Hopefully one of the mods stickies something to this effect.</p></p>

        <p><p>It'll be branded as fake news lol. But for real, we need concrete evidence tying the Clintons and Podesta to Comet Pizza. It's one thing to be associated with a pedophile its another to actually go to one of these places. I'd recommend travel logs or something to Comet. We NEED them there</p></p>

        <p><p>The most mind blowing part to all of this...is the mass mind control, and the intentional dumbing down of the public. The types of people who are on social media are not the types of people who read long articles. They simply are just too weak minded; stupid, if you will. They have literally had their minds poisoned, assaulted, and groomed, for their entire life.</p>
<p>The sad part about this is that these people are unfortunately so dumb, that they will act exactly as the establishment tells them to act. They will believe only what the established order tells them to believe.</p>
<p>The hardest part of our campaign will be waking these people up. We face mass censorship, and now the globalist Illuminati are launching a counter intelligence attack that will demonize "alt right" information outlets as "white nationalist, fake news". They will threaten "populist movements" with war, economic doom and gloom, and try every trick in the book. </p>
<p>We must remain vigilant, and remember, rationality and logic are on our side. We will prevail as long as we keep the tip of the spear pointed directly at them, and do not get side tracked by false flags, war, no matter how horrible or scary things may get.</p>
<p>Remember, we are many, they are few. If everyone is aware of the trickery, and we ratify a constitutional amendment that will prevent this from ever happening again, we can take our country back.  Our livelihood, our children, and the very future of western civilization is at stake.</p>
<p>God bless and Godspeed patriots.</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>Remember, we are many, they are few.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The few controlling mainstream media have a great deal of influence among social-media types. But this attention is earned through the hard work of distilling large swaths of information into easily digestible forms. This process of reductionism sustains the establishment, promoting stability on a large scale while empowering the elite to do as they please.</p>
<p>You don't get out of that trap by putting forth long-winded and speculative diatribes. There needs to be cold, incontrovertible proof made available for all to see. This proof may not even exist on the internet, but if enough doubt surrounds this issue a true source may come forward.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't think you've read enough. This system of control is older than America, older than Christianity. I'm not trying to be a pessimist, but no big public reveal is going to end well. The weaponry against the plebs is shocking. They don't just control money and governments. They control the weather, earthquakes, weaponized satellites. </p>
<p>The real duty of every individual with knowledge of the system is to make personal peace with themselves. This is not going to end well. The revolution will not be televised. </p></p>

        <p><p>Have fun with that. You do know how many dead people are linked to just the Clintons, yes? You know that much of the sites and memes being shared about just these two pizza joints are reaching and easily explained as art or dark humor, yes? To convince the masses, you'd need hard evidence, with audio and video, and broadcast to a high enough percentage of people to actually enrage the public. </p></p>

<p>See, you just reacted the same way someone would to the suggestion of pedophilia? <em>That's silliness...</em> </p></p>

        <p><p>If you are trying to post an image, https://sli.mg/ is probably your best bet. You can also post it to http://imgur.com/ but I think they sometimes purge controversial images. Once you've posted your image though, I would advise using the 'Wayback Machine' on https://archive.org/ to look up the slimg url. This will give you a second (or third) backup link for your image.</p>
<p>If you don't have an image file though, I'm not sure what would be the best way to share what you have. If this is the case, please share the file extension and I'll try to point you in the right direction.</p>
<p>Also, if you have a decent infographic that you think is valuable from a PR standpoint, please consider submitting it as a standalone thread rather than as a comment. If you want to collaborate, I've tried to create my own flyer (4 flyers per piece of paper) that would potentially catch the eye of Hillary supporters: https://sli.mg/PgEEK8</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not sure how much of a help a MindMap graphic would be compared to a flyer. With MindMap, each subsection needs to be opened in order to access the info - so it seems like it would be better suited to organizing large-scale datasets.</p>
<p>I'd like to see the research organized into a small number of major groupings. ie Influence Trafficking, Weapons Trafficking, Drug Trafficking, Human Trafficking, Money Trafficking. Those seem to be the major commodities our "racketering friends" enjoy most. So that's where the crimes will be exposed.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's too late. We already have 16,000 subscribers. Those numbers took awhile to grab. If we jump ship, we have to rebuild out popularity all over again. And by the way, hasn't this sub been exploding with new viewers anyway?</p></p>

        <p><p>Wouldn't it be good to leave out the Podesta connection altogether in the infographic??</p>
<p>If it's a 'child sex trafficking scandal'/ 'pedo ring', you can get a lot of libtards up in arms about it before they realize it's linked to their precious party.</p>
<p>Or one step further could be putting some stupid slogan blaming Trump for it. What a way to get them involved. This stuff has clearly been going on for years/ decades, it's just to catch their idiot attention.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p></p>

        <p><p>huh I like the part about removing Podesta from the first infographic. It would certain grab a wider viewership. As for the Trump part, it would may gain momentum faster but I'm worried it would not be reversible on to Podesta as MSM never seems to let go of certain lies. </p></p>

        <p><p>You forgot to mention something extremely important. They know we're investigating and they have more eyes on them than they could ever hope to "suicide".</p>
<p>They have already cleaned places of evidence, or they're in the process of doing so. They're not stupid to stay in their old hideouts that has been discovered by so many.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think it is important to illustrate the FBI's involvement in pointing out clues, filling us in on the backstory via FBIAnon, Twitter, 4chan, etc. While parts of the FBI appear corrupt, I think most people generally trust them as a whole. I followed the FBI clues and chan/reddit reactions very closely and have pieced together most of what happened. </p></p>

        <p><p>The fact that you think 9/11 truth (I hate that slogan) is something negative to be contrasted to is evidence that good PR for pizzagate is necessary.</p></p>

        <p><p>Of course it's negative and here's why, in the court of public opinion 9/11 truthers are conspiracy theorists and their topic of choice is played out, if pizzagate gets conflated with all the other theories like it, then it can be written off and it becomes boring in the public eye- something to laugh at. </p></p>

        <p><p>No, this is not what we need.  All we need is one decent piece of concrete evidence.  And no, creepy videos and creepy instagram pics are not concrete evidence.  If we have the evidence, the PR will follow.</p>
<p>This is such bad advice as to almost be intentionally derailing.  If we go for PR with no proof, we will be laughed at.  We do need to be quick, its just that we need to quickly get the evidence.</p>
<p>You claim that the pedos would be sitting on their thumbs; on the contrary the pedos would be scrambling to destroy all evidence and anything that could incriminate them.  If it exists, we need to get it before they can delete it (again). </p></p>

        <p><p>You also appear to have missed a point that I explained in another comment thread </p>
<blockquote>
<p>No one will give a shit about what we have to show later if the narrative is that this is a conspiracy, which was the point of this post, which you probably should've read before commenting. Being proactive about PR is always a good thing and better PR does not in any way detract from those doing the digging. Now go dig if that's what you deem to be important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I meant when I said "sitting on their thumbs", was that they are doing nothing in terms of their interaction with the media with regard to this scandal (and in general really)</p>
<p>edit:for fuck's sake I'm just going to explain this so people stop commenting nonsense like this. IF we can get more people talking about it in the right way, AS WELL AS continuing to dig for evidence, when the evidence finally comes out it won't be received as conspiracy theory nonsense. ALSO, if the general public all start asking questions (BECAUSE THIS MOVEMENT HAD GOOD PR AND GOT THE FUCKING WORD OUT) it puts alot more pressure on the people behind it to interact with the press. In simple terms, if everyone believes it, someone will need to be blamed. </p>
<p><strong>Literally all I am saying is that we need to get the word out to fucking everyone, in a way that doesn't get this scandal written off as nonsense, and I've seen three of you stupid asses so far saying that is a bad idea somehow. Do you not want people to think this scandal has legitimacy? Do you not want everyone and their fucking grandma to know about it?</strong> </p>
<p>Do not waste your time questioning the validity of this when you could be doing something else more productive.</p></p>

        <p><p>That there is the problem. They are destroying evidence. The public doesn't have enough resources to do this properly i'm afraid. We need to make it a society thing so the spotlight is forced on the subject.</p></p>

<p>This is formatted to fit facebook's feed.  Let me know if you guys have any suggestions to improve it.  I was struggling to find a good font.  I've got various design, adobe suite, video and sound production skills that I'd love to offer to the initiative.  One of those captioned videos to catch facebook scrollers would be good to get together.</p>
<hr>
<p>As for the message of this post, I could not agree more.  PR is everything.  What we need is to spread curiosity as fast as possible.  We need a stickied post with a straightforward and brief walkthrough of the most damning and irrefutable evidence so newcomers can get a quick understanding. </p>
<p>Then I would suggest the mods implement a flair system to label things: Strong, Debatable, Weak, and Debunked.  And start cracking down on shit that has absolutely nothing to do with the problem at hand-- in another thread people were talking about global energy resonances and saying that maybe Reptilian aliens are real. (it was in relation to Cathy Obrien and the apparent brainwashing she underwent, but the slanderous media sure as hell won't care and their audience will be happy to know we've all just lost our minds.)</p></p>

        <p><p>I think that's exactly what we need right now.  Stickied right at the top.  As is evident, lots of people are curious, but I think the vast majority will need to be roped in with a simple, straightforward synopsis.  I'm going to try to make some videos for other social media, and see if I can't compile some info and graphics for a post here.</p></p>

        <p><p>Take a look at all the legitimate scandals with legitimate evidence that should've broke around the Clinton's over the years that didn't because they were swept under the rug or written off as conspiracy theories by those that control the media (and therefore the narrative). That said, it's your choice to be deluded and unproductive and you're more than welcome to do so. Happy digging!</p></p>

        <p><p>I actually think both of you are correct. As it stands evidence for Pizzagate is pretty weak when analyzed on its own.</p>
<p>On the flip side, if we allow opposition to create the narrative the battle to convince the general public will be 10x as hard.</p>
<p>I think a more success approach (and one which I plan to follow) is to creat tie ins with other p-rings internationally. Once you see the proliferation of the phenomena of child sex in the upper echelons of government, then the likelihood of the DNC and CF being involved suddenly explodes into likelihood. </p>
<p>Additionally other international rings have been reported on by MSM and lend credibility to the general public.</p>
<p>So, yes current evidence is weak for the uninitiated, and yes the battle for opinion should start now. </p></p>

        <p><p>Your behavior is significantly more suspicious than the OP's: "I don't agree so you're a shill." Consider this a warning. </p></p>

        <p><p>Just replied to another one of your comments but thought I'd answer this too. </p>
<p>Depends on how "throwaway" you want to go. For a simple throwaway, you can always just use incognito mode (this also allows you to stay logged in on your normal account). If you're super paranoid though, you could always download Tor and make an account from there.</p>
<p>Note: You do <strong>NOT</strong> need an email to register a new Reddit account.</p></p>
