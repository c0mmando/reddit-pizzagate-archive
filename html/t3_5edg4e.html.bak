        <strong>THIS IS NOT A DUPE!!! STOP REMOVING MY POSTS!</strong>
        <p><p>http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/fashion/ivanka-trump-bracelet-60-minutes-conflict-of-interest.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0</p>
<p>Smearing the TRUMP family name by attacking Ivanka for wearing her own brand of clothing? The reporter even says in the article "such emails are not uncommon in fashion brands". Can someone please explain how this is more newsworthy then bringing public awareness to the rampant pedophilia that is undeniably happening across the world?</p></p>

        <p><p>Probably getting removed because it's only tangentially related the sub, not directly related. We have all accepted that we have fake news already</p></p>

        <p><p>How is this not related to pizzagate when the NYT is the only msm source to cover it? This kind of petty reporting costs them their credibility.</p></p>

        <p><p>You think Pizzagate is going to take on the battle of discrediting each and every outlet based on their petty reporting? None of that is new to people...</p>
<p>Certainly unrelated and will soon be deleted.</p></p>

        <p><p>possibly due to the argument being essentially that the new york times is not focusing on the right topic....which is the norm.</p></p>
