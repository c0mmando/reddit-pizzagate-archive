        <strong>Two sides of the story?</strong>
        <p><p>Hey reddit. I'm new to the whole pizza gate conspiracy theory and i saw something that briefly cleared up what people are accusing josh pedesta of doing. But, even though this is a forum about investigating, I would really like to hear what both those defending pedesta and those exposing him are saying. </p></p>

        <p><p>Most niche subreddits (and this one is <em>very</em> niche) have the basics in the sidebar. I would refer to that.</p></p>

        <p><p>People defending him are saying that it's a baseless alt-right conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>People (from across the political spectrum) exposing him are gathering mountains of connections and "coincidences" (which you can learn more about by reading a LOT on this subreddit) that point to John Podesta being connected to a large child trafficking ring.</p>
<p>Some terms to look out for if you choose to dive in: Besta Pizza, Comet Ping Pong, Marina Abramovic, Laura Silsby. There's plenty more, but that should give you a good start.</p></p>

        <p><p>I see. The fact that there are so many coincidences make the story a lot more interesting. Thanks for helping me understand it a bit better :)</p></p>
