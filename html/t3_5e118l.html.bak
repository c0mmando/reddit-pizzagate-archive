        <strong>coordinated celebrity twitter assualt tomorrow</strong>
        <p><p>we need a coordinated celebrity twitter exposure. whether to expose the celebrities to the information we have here or hijack their visibility and audience it needs to be done within a few hour span. the best targets are contrarian celebrities who have a reputation of being demonized by the media and powers at be for their beliefs, and even better celebrities that exist outside the United States. right now ticketmaster is refunding all tickets to Kanye's tour because he spoke out on Jay, Beyonce, and Pizzagate. these contrarian celebrities have always stood by their convictions and have been demonized for it. these are people who do not play the elitist game. off the top ive come to three celebrities with large audiences that are known for being excluded from mainstream despite their popularity due to their "no bs" approach to the system.</p>
<p>please post your no bullshit celebs and their twitter handles and lets decide on a time, hashtags, and the celebs we'll blow up</p>
<p>edit 2:</p>
<p><strong>updated list:</strong></p>
<p><strong>@rustyrockets : Russel Brand</strong> (outed from MSM for calling out Hugo Boss during 2013 GQ awards for fashioning Nazi outfits)</p>
<p><strong>@kanyewest : kanye west</strong> (ticketmaster is issuing refunds for his tour for speaking out on Jay Z, Beyonce, Pizzagate at his shows)</p>
<p><strong>@deadmau5 : joel zimmerman</strong> (outed from mainstream EDM scene for not being complicit with Ministry of Sound, Ultra, and BBC which have recently been cleared out in UK pedorings)</p>
<p><strong>@billburr : Bill Burr</strong> (known contrarian, recently went on Conan after election and talked about Dillhog and her NWO)</p>
<p><strong>@joerogan : Joe Rogan</strong> (dudes takes a shit ton of psychedelics and has a commune. also i wish he was my dad, known contrarian but also adept at playing the game)</p>
<p><strong>@JimCarrey : Jim Carrey</strong></p>
<p><strong>@DaveChapelle : Dave Chapelle</strong> (has spoken out on the cabal and outed for it many times)</p>
<p><strong>@HenryRollins : Henry Rollins</strong> (just doesnt give a flying fuck. punk as fuck. puts ppl in awkward situations with the teen angst he never grew out of. rational, not afraid to ask questions, does not submit to the status quo. isnt afraid to recognize when hes flawed or a person is right)</p>
<p><strong>@chrishansen : Chris Hansen</strong> (everyones favorite pedohunter. fired from NBC when he exposed a Texas Senator on Dateline for pedophilia. has been outed by MSM since)</p>
<p><strong>@elijahwood : Elijah Wood</strong> (spoken out on hollywood pedoring)</p>
<p><strong>@Corey_Feldman : Corey Feldman</strong> (spoken out and victimized by hollywood pedoring)</p>
<p><strong>@H3H3productions : Ethan and Hila Klein</strong> (papa fucking bless. stop exposing bullshit youtubers and start doing some real shit)</p>
<p><strong>@cthagod - Charlemagne</strong> (total fucking ass but will question your motives 100)</p>
<p><strong>@angelayee</strong> - Does the rumor-report on the national Power Hip Hop radio syndicate </p>
<p><strong>@RealSway - Sway</strong> Sway In The Morning Hip Hop talk radio</p>
<p><strong>@RealJamesWoods - James Woods</strong> (seems to be deeply troubled with political situation)</p>
<p><strong>@ScottAdamsSays - Scott Adams</strong> (creator of dilbert has been recently shutdown for not being complicit in the Dillhog coronation)</p>
<p><strong>@phillyd - Phillip DeFranco</strong> (youtuber who at appearance seems to be extremely self aware, fair and balanced. works well with mainstream audiences)</p>
<p><strong>#TECHNOREVOLUTION</strong></p>
<p><strong>#VoiceOfAGeneration</strong></p>
<p><strong>#pizzagate</strong></p>
<p><strong>#WeAreWatching</strong></p>
<p><strong>#PodestaTakeASeat</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>TWITTER MESSAGE (REVISIONS ACCEPTED IN COMMENTS)</strong></p>
<p>--</p>
<p>help us [@celebrity] you're our only hope #pizzagate #technorevolution #wearewatching</p>
<p>--</p>
<p><strong>edit 3:</strong></p>
<p>this thread is being bombarded by downvotes and the mods still have not answered. people this is the visibility we need. this strategy is an offense in a war being fought through technology and public opinion. FIGHT THIS. SHARE THE TWITTER ASSAULT. be public. be transparent. let people know you fight the war against these evil atrocities. we all know this is coming down. do not stand idle be proud as a frontline warrior in your fight against the evils that have supressed us and dont let those children die in vain.</p>
<p><strong>edit 4:</strong></p>
<p>VISIBILITY STRATEGY :</p>
<p>please make sure if you do not use the recommended twitter message to include in your tweet #TECHNOREVOLUTION through this hashtag we will be able to identify our kin. like, share, and retweet as many of these dual #pizzagate - #TECHNOREVOLUTION posts as you can when the assualt launches. this is basic SEO. they can not silence all accounts or tweets or hashtags and the more intertwined/public they are the harder they are to trace and remove. you guys keep asking how we expose this to the MSM and give this visibility and this is it. this is a fucking war being fought through information and technology and these are the battle plans. in unity we have protection and safety. this is how we expose this to the world at large.</p></p>

        <p><p>Joe Rogan is a feaking gatekeeper.  He actually still believes that 19 arabs stole 4 planes with 'almost knives' and flew them into buildings, which then managed to all fall down.  If that isn't either the definition of a gatekeeper or a complete freaking idiot, I don't know what is...</p></p>

        <p><p>I've heard him state that building 7 was a controlled demolition multiple times, or atleast it looked like one and should be investigated. Has also mentioned the dodgy Saudi ties to it and the US govt. Anyway its irrelevant, the dude is a much bigger proponent of conspiracy theories than your average guy.</p></p>

        <p><p>ive read both LaVey's and Crowley's bibles. </p>
<p>LaVey was luciferian. not a practitioner in magic but a worshipper of the human condition. Crowley coincides with magick and paganism. his practices can be traced back to the days of alchemy.</p>
<p>basically if youre not familiar with alchemy or magick it operates off of a principal of duality. or if youve ever seen the anime Full Metal Alchemist that principle. second law of thermodynamics for u theoretical philosophical nerds. basically there needs to be balance, energy within a closed system can never be created nor destroyed, nihil ex nihilo... lets say you want to summon a lesser demon that upon mastery of the demon will give you control over love of a single person. sacrifice a chicken. lets say you want the keys to the white house and ultimate power/control of humanity. you must torture and destroy a region of people and the most innocent people you can find... children, muslims minding their own business... etc etc. </p>
<p>in full metal alchemist they refer to this summoning as something called the "philosophers stone" and the philosophers stone in FMA was created through the destruction of an entire race of people. it is through human suffering, the loss of innocence, that these people believe they gain power.</p>
<p>whether you believe in demons or satan this is what these people believe and this is why they do what they do.</p>
<p>LaVey was a practitioner in humanity, which in traditional teachings is sinful. crowley was a practitioner in magick which requires torture, suffering, and human sacrifice to summon the demons of King Solomon.</p></p>

        <p><p>Great idea with this celebrity targeting campaign man. Even if we can't get any official celebs to pick it up, we will certainly generate interest in the topic when people notice the hashtag.</p></p>

<p>“Uploaded on Feb 24, 2011 this is and EDITED VERSION of me as a guest on the Opie and Anthony show on Sirrius XM radio 202. I asked the former secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, if he and Dick CHeney are lizards from outerspace who eat human flesh, for example: Mexican babies. He did not answer the question directly. He did not deny it. Much was discussed. Anthony Cumia of the show was simultaneously asking some interesting political questions. Mister Rumsfeld was courteous, but he gave me no reason to doubt that he is a lizard. http://www.louisck.com”</p></p>

        <p><p>This shit right here is what we call a tin foil hat wearer. 
How is this disinfo? The lizard people idea has been floating around for some time and you got someone to directly ask the question to the guy. </p>
<p>All I was trying to say was that Louis CK is obviously into conspiracy shit on some level. There was a time when your particular brand of info and proof were once looked upon as crazy bullshit too. I don't personally believe that lizard people are a real thing and the clip was provided after being asked for it. I merely brought up the fact that Louis once asked Don Rumsfeld if he was a lizard person, nothing more. </p>
<p>Not everyone here is a shill, or out to get you, or out to spread disinformation, you loon. </p></p>

        <p><p>yeah hes not necessarily too contrarian or isnt known for being excluded from MSM due to his outspoken behavior, i added him anyways though i think what he says we should be wary of as if we include celebs that our compromised by the network we open ourselves up to disinfo</p></p>

        <p><p>He is dangerous - he can phrase serious things in a way to make it sound funny and he can add a spin to it that too many people just accept.  His argument for Hillary was basically "shes a mom and america needs a mom right now, not another shitty dad" and the fucking audience ate it up.  I swear, people do not THINK</p></p>

<p>@cthagod - Charlemagne's Twitter</p>
<p>@angelayee - Does the rumor-report during the show everyday</p>
<p>@SwayCalloway- Sway In The Morning, a popular radio show on serious</p>
<p>Edit: Deleted @SwayCalloway in a moment of indecision, because I don't know how political he would really get. It's worth a shot though</p>
<p>Also DJ Akademiks @IamAkademiks would totally do an episode on this </p></p>

<p>sorry thank you for contributing to the thread im not trying to shoot you down i just want us to scrutinize as much as possible as to not make this campaign descreditable or tie in people who would easily manipulate us.</p>
<p>really though Tommy thanks for being as active as i am on this campaign. keep offering suggestions, giving your opinions, and fighting my rebuttals thats whats gonna take this far.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm also not sure bt I think through their ties with the Obamas and the Clintons. Also, during Kanye's rant he told Jay Z to please not send his shooters for him. </p></p>

        <p><p>I didn't think about the rocafella ties. The only counter to that I would have would be the recent Kanye thing. But that's not much. 
I completely agree about not wanting this to become discredited. There is too much being found for this to not be legitimate. </p></p>

        <p><p>I think there is a big divide in the music scene. Like there is no reason why Dre and Kendrick Lamar aren't dominating. Top Dog Entertainment is hype and it makes sense that they wouldn't be famous or played over the radio waves constantly cuz they don't kiss ass to Jay-Z... Just a theory but makes sense with Dre's reclusiveness. </p></p>

        <p><p>let me see some evidence. kevin hart isnt a known contrarian/for being outspoken and given his popularity he could really fuck up our movement if hes implicit. im easily swayed though so lay it out for me and i wont have an issue adding him.</p></p>

<p>They will put anyone on, although I do not really trust them to talk about this subject. I just want people to see pizzagate on C2C's page, and get curious. </p>
<p>I just remembered...ART BELL's son was abused by a family friend. </p></p>

        <p><p>if he has an audience and is known for sparking retaliation through the MSM (creating publicity for pizzagate which will inspire people to take a trip into the google machine) then he's good. however, be wary of making this movement bipartisan. this is not anti-Dillhog/Obama it goes back to the Bush Dynasty too. and i say this as a former fervent Obama supporter. this is not about the DNC, or liberals, this is about a church and their ritualistic practice of murdering and raping our children and making us implicit in this through their governance in the white house and the 4th branch. this is not alt-right. this is not anti-DNC. our children are being murdered and raped at a price more than it costs the heroin homeless drug addicts you step over on your way to work every day pay for with their grandmas money.</p>
<p>if this guy being tweeted at by a twitter army/assault and his audience is one to think a little more critically than a @OneDirection follower would this is the perfect person to add to the list.</p></p>

        <p><p>I totally agree. It's just that the celebs I mentioned were not afraid in the past to speak out  to the detriment of their careers. I feel, with lots of evidence, that 99.7%of celebs are afraid of leaving the PC reservation, and in the practice of self preservation. </p>
<p>I don't know of many other mainstream celebs out of the 10,000s who have not shown much individualism in the past. </p>
<p>If I think of other non-fringe celebs I will let you know.   </p></p>

        <p><p>Some suggestions those that have a network and are passionate about social justice.</p>
<p><strong>Mariska Hargitay</strong>- women from law and order involved in getting rape kits tested nationally. She would have a great network.</p>
<p><strong>Killer Mike</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cornel West</strong>- staunch supporter of Assange and fearless. Great network and no love for the clintons</p>

        <p><h2><strong>Stop.</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Do not do this.</strong> Evidence is lacking. Believe me, I want this too, I'm literally losing sleep over this, but this 'assault' is fucking crazy.</p>
<p>This reeks of a plant in order to make us look foolish and discredit Wikileaks further. We do not have enough evidence and acting too soon will ruin us.</p>

        <p><p>thank you for being public and not using a throwaway.</p>
<p>your sentiment is right.</p>
<p>however, we are literally at war. assange is dead.
"wars of the future will not be fought with guns but with information"</p>
<p>its time stop fucking around. we can not trust our authorities to investigate or prosecute these things. this is why the leaks came from within the FBI.</p>
<p>this is revolution. we can not trust these people. wikileaks has a 100/100 track record. we have seen pictures of our children tied and taped up. we have seen pedophiles flaunt our children in front of our faces.</p>
<p>this is not okay. this is not a trial. this will not be changed through a court or government we can not trust. this is revolution. </p></p>

        <p><p>that was an inside joke lol</p>
<p>really tho of you dive deeper into my account youll get a good look at my history as not only a contrarian but an idealist and marketer/SEO specialist. im pretty authentic and honest in what i project and the rhetoric i involve myself in and have a track record for being a part of the "innovator"/"early adopter" crowd on a marketing curve.</p>
<p>i made a very intentional and specific decision to associate my alias as a part of this movement at the risk of being discredited and mocked. in an effort to develop repoire and prove to detractors like you that im not shilling or inciting a riot.</p>
<p>you can see in my history i have a record of brutal honesty, self awareness, idealism, marketing/sociology prowess, and am willing to concede when im wrong.</p>
<p>calling me a mod of /r/sissyboys was the weakest argument you could make against me. i am not shy. i show my face regularly and im here to stand up and fight for what i believe is right just like all of you.</p></p>

        <p><p>i am campaigning and organizing the first wave tomorrow. i will be off grid for who knows how many weeks in an undisclosed location. i will return before january 1st and if you havent organized and got your shit together by then i will be taking the reigns and organizing under my campaign.</p>
<p>i will not let this fall to disorganized Occupy bullshit. theybwere too susceptible to disinfo and did not understand how to fight the MSM. i have three grassroots campaigns ive described in detail in my reddit history that ive organized and campaigned in a manner that put my clients and brands on a mainstream stage.</p>
<p>i will run my campaign tomorrow and disappear until january 1st. if you are not organized and hitting them on the media front by then i will usurp and organize this campaign. do not doubt me. my track record is infallible.</p></p>

        <p><p>maybe a #revolutionpizza or #pizzagate or #pizzarevolution idk anybody got a good idea for an image or tag that can help drive an audience to our resources?</p>
<p>is there a spreadsheet or file from the heroku dataset weve been submitting to that we can direct an audience to? i think our best possible solution would be directing celebs and their followers to the stickied map/infograph tomorrow . these people will be early adopters and influencers and by broadcasting raw data to them we can let the info sink into their content/rhetoric. then hit all socplatforms in late december with the video/easily digestable media the homies from earlier today are working on for a late adopter audience that needs basics after the info has set in to the early adopters and innovators. itll reach tipping point if "all the cool kids are doing it" and the late adopters have information they can digest without going through the pains of research innovator/influencer and early adopter wave go through. then MSM will be forced to break the story.</p></p>

        <p><p>I remember this. But I still think this is akin to Noam Chomsky or Cornell Lewis criticizing obama. </p>
<p>He is for himself, first, or else he would actually give up 70% of his income, like the marxist/communists he supports. </p>
<p>But I hear you. the goal is to get answers from as many people as possible. I do not want to distract from this. My apologies! </p></p>

        <p><p>No Marxist / Communists are in no way obligated to give up wealth within a corrupt capitalist system. Marxists do not believe in charity. In fact they are generally against it as it's a sticking plaster to stop the otherwise revolution against the system that would occur.
Telling a celebrity they must be poor if they want social justice is like telling a revolutionary he must give up his guns if he wants to fight the system. Or saying if you don't like the way society is go live in a cave. He does use his wealth and time to help fund resistance to the system. He has no obligation to join the poor in their economic misery because he objects to the system.</p></p>
