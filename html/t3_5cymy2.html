        <p><p>A quick google search of the Father's name popped up with a DailyMail story about how the mother gave the children canabis and forced them to say these things. The father has been cleared of all wrong doing.</p>

        <p><p>You can (and should) examine the evidence yourself. You might find that there's been a terrible cover-up, as I'm convinced.</p>
<p>This channel has hours of interviews with the children:  https://youtu.be/Yi61QZPNzN0</p>
<p>It's hard to fathom how two very young children could fabricate extensively detailed and complex corroborating accounts, consistently without a shred of hesitation, doubt or uncertainty. </p></p>

        <p><p>This might be reaching, but Cathy O'Brien (woman who claims she and her daughter were a part of MKUltra) says cannabis disrupts the abusers "programming". </p>
<p>I think this programming she's talking about is a reference to how they intentionally cause DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) to compartmentalize and/or manipulate the brains of their subjects, so they can subconsciously suppress memories of the abusers' choosing. </p>
<p>So my thought after watching 2-3 hours of interviews with the children (particularly the boy) of the Hampstead case: I think the mother knew enough about the practices (or maybe even was a victim herself?) and wanted to help, so maybe (again, I guess I'm reaching) she secretly gave the boy cannabis and coached him to remember the truth. </p>
<p>If true, this would be perfect for the abuser, as it makes the mother look crazy, and would show that she "told the boy to say those things".</p>
<p>In one of the earlier interviews, the boy makes all of the wild claims (abuse, murder of babies, rituals, etc.), then in a later interview he claims he lied and made it all up. I personally think it's possible that in between those interviews, his memory had somehow been suppressed again, and it hasn't come back since. </p>
<p>I suspect that even if we can find children that were a part of this madness and made it out, it would be hard to get them to remember the things they experienced, even if they tried. </p>
<p>Anyway, I'm mostly speculating, and don't have any hard evidence, so all I can say is that I'm not 100% convinced the testimony he originally gave was false. </p></p>

        <p><p>Of course they are cleared of wrong doing. Judges and child services have high percentages of pedophiles among them. </p>
<p>Ask yourself if you were a pedo and wanted access to vulnerable at risk children what would be the best profession? Child services. Second to that, teacher. Teachers are constantly getting caught having sex with their students, especially female teachers.</p></p>

        <p><p>Dafuq? There is no amount of therapy that is going to make these children ever grow up into being healthy people. This is terrible.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm terribly disturbed by how nonchalantly they discuss the topics as if it's completely normal. What the hell is this??? Is there any way this is totally not real? Christ.</p></p>

        <p><p>That's how it works. It's so systematic. It's a religion to these people. They are literally shattering the child's psyche and programming them. There are parallels of this in many stories, lot of people point to Alice in wonderland. </p></p>

<p>I find it really hard to believe that that could be the result of children simply playing make believe.</p></p>
