        <strong>Suggestion: We're not looking at the people who make, distribute, and buy CP. It has to be a small group of people. Rich people, it's expensive.</strong>
        <p><p>This is a tricky subject to bring up, let alone get into. I haven't dove into it myself because just searching about the issue is liable to make you look like a suspicious person. So the first thing to do is to <strong>be careful</strong>.</p>
<p>The reason I'm bringing this up is that I've noticed something about the random stories I see about CP. <em>It's incredibly expensive</em>. Think about what kind of market forces have to be at work  to create this condition. Only very wealthy people could afford this on the scale needed to make it as prevalent as it is.</p>
<p>The important thing about that, to me, is that we must also be talking about a very small number of people, and the importance of that is, that we could narrow things down, and start to <strong>follow the money</strong>.</p>
<p>I'll find links and more info to source some of what I've said, but I have, you know...a job, so bare with me, but I think my reasoning is pretty solid and what I'm saying is more or less self-evident.</p></p>

        <p><p>its still worth digging.
the social circle is still like a drug trade, the centre gets the biggest piece of the pie, even the peons still want into the circle, whether  drug or pedo</p>
<p>howeever, it's the poorer ones that are more likely to slip up and give possibly more leads</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p><strong>be careful</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>this is FUD. Don't post here if you have no courage. We don't need people who are going to damage morale. You are damaging morale.</p>
<p>we need to make it clear that we will absolutely destroy these people. we will wreck them and there will be nothing left. absolutely nothing. we have to make it clear that these people are going to live in a world where they will have no freedom.</p>
<p>We have to make these people suicidal. We owe it to the children. We must start attacking those who protect these evil people. We must start destroying lives and making them pay. Showing them that they are life unworthy of life, and demonstrating that to them, is a very effective way of breaking their will.</p>
<p>We must break their will. This is done through strength and righteousness. We have to start attacking these people and making it impossible for them do think about anything other than how many kids they have fucked and killed.</p></p>

        <p><p>What does "FUD" mean? Regardless...I'm not "damaging morale" <strong>at all</strong>. I'm saying be careful, because, frankly, how easy would it be to accidentally stumble into the very thing you're trying to defeat? I mean, accidentally looking at CP.</p>
<p>Essentially I'm saying be intelligent, which is the correct approach to take. The only reason I think this is worth the risk is because it allows us to follow money rather than strange coincidences. </p>
<p>EDIT: Left out a word.</p></p>

        <p><p>some of us are diggers, some of us are cheerleaders and helpers, and someof us are going to be canaries in the coal mine.   And some are shills, trolls or worse.  Judge us by our fruit, and let us be helpful in different ways.   Truth and hope and love are our best weapons.</p></p>
