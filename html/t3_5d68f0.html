        <strong>Does anyone have a copy of this video that was taken down? Lady talking at private party in the restaurant?</strong>
        <p><p>I started watching this video a few weeks ago when the Pizzagate stuff started breaking on Reddit but now it's been taken down. The video is very creepy but I think I stopped watching as it was getting late and I needed to sleep.</p>

        <p><p>Thanks, The bit where she jokes about euthanizing her own baby was really weird. I can't imagine any scenario where that would be acceptable. </p></p>
