        <p><p>BS.  A video of it going on or saving actual kids can't help?  Just imagine how much public support we would get.  We don't have time for law enforcement, FBI, CIA etc and if you think they are going to help your going to be in for a surprise.  They are all involved.  The public will need to take care of this.  Do not expect the law to be on our side.  This is way too big. This has been going on for way too long.</p></p>

        <p><p>I see what you are saying.  But we have no choice other than to expose as much info as possible.  It is what got us this far.  The issue is Matt did not get enough publicity.  We have momentum.  He is a political prisoner.  We will free him soon.  We must make everything as public as possible.  A video could be of kids leaving JimmyComet's trap house etc it doesn't have to be CP.  We need counter surveillance ASAP on the ground and ex intel people to help out.</p></p>

        <p><p>Could somebody go and physically 'sniff' the IP's in that area that are broadcasting (and maybe even any hidden SSID's being picked up)? </p></p>
