        <strong>Some of the YELP comments about The Comet pizza that are beyond creepy</strong>

<p>I am old, so I am not tech savvy, but I cut and pasted some of the most glaring comments...I hope this is helpful; it's probably redundant...</p></p>

        <p><p>The weird stuff about the secret passageway to the bathroom; "bumping into" kids; kids playing ping pong after 9:30pm until midnight; that photo of the young boy with the caption "wood for oven stacked near kitchen" with no mention of the boy; crying kids everywhere...To me it all seems very strange and creepy...</p></p>

        <p><p>It's all obvious, this shit is rampant everywhere. They're only talking about it this blatantly because they've been used to getting away with this for so long. But a 2 weeks ago no one even knew pizza was codeword for this. Now that the collective consciousness knows, we're gonna realize it's everywhere, and hopefully bring it down.</p></p>

        <p><p>Links, preferably with pages backed up on archive.is first (as strange things happen to this stuff once it gets noticed by too many people.)</p>
<p>No offense, but something like this isn't that persuasive without evidence of source.</p></p>

        <p><p>1) Go to the page in question and copy the url
2) Go to archive.is and paste the address into the appropriately marked bar (near the top of the screen - marked "My url is alive and I want to archive its content") and hit the "save the page" button.</p>
<p>It'll take a moment, and then produce an archived version of the page.  Copy the url address from this newly created page, and edit it into your post (and in reply to this comment if you'd be so kind.)</p></p>

        <p><p>There's nothing here. You're reading too far into these. If they were written by anybody associated with the DNC, then there might be something. But I don't think any of these are worth a damn.</p></p>

        <p><p>They all seem normal Tom me. Except the very bottom one. Who says"Every pizza is awesome" I don't know anyone that tries new pizza. I only know people that get the same type every time.  </p></p>
