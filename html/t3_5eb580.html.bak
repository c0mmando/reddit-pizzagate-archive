        <strong>Weird or sinister?</strong>
        <p><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I woke up this morning to find that I had been unsubscribed to this sub. I took no action whatsoever to do that and I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this.</p>
<p>Is it just a glitch in my account or are they trying to artificially decrease traffic to this corner of the site?</p></p>

        <p><p>Probably a little of both. Anytime I come here and look under <em>new</em> almost everything is at 0.</p></p>
