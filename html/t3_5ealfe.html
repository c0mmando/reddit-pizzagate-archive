        <strong>The REALLY big picture. Please read.</strong>
        <p><p>There is an emerging story here that goes far beyond pizza, so I will try to pull the thread together and tell you what the rest of the world wants to tell us. Pizza is the tip of the iceberg. It doesn't matter what pasta means or whether Clinton is involved specifically.</p>
<p>Here are the questions you should be asking yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Human trafficking involves almost a million smuggled children per year. How do these organizations stick around? Are they run by expert cryptographers, somehow managing to smuggle millions of live human beings without leaving a digital fingerprint, evading the NSA's reach? (Hint: no)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many intelligence agencies are there in the world? How do human traffickers manage to evade all of them? (Hint: they don't)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What sorts of people are able to afford children? If you are rich enough to buy multiple children, are you the sort of person who is likely to be able to donate to politicians? (Hint: yes)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>THE BIG QUESTION</p>
<p>Q: How do large-scale bad things get past the NSA?
A: They don't.
Q: Why are they still around then?
A: [deleted]</p>
<p>Other points of departure include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Clinton's email server was hacked by every government in the world... except the NSA?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every politician routinely has a private email server to conduct "unofficial business"... and the NSA missed it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clinton deleted her emails... and the NSA doesn't have them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The President of the United States had a private email server... and the NSA was OK with this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SEVERAL (maybe all) MAJOR POLITICIANS HAVE COMPROMSIED SENSITIVE NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION ON UNSECURED SERVERS... and the NSA missed it?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you understand? These are fairy tales.</p>
<p>So now I ask: other than human trafficking, what <em>other</em> non-government-sanctioned "large-scale bad things?" How do THEY manage to stick around?</p></p>

        <p><p>It's obvious. A single child-trafficker can make $150,000 each child per year. That's HUGE money. Why is our government suddenly excluded from the picture? Because the media, ran by the government, told us so? Then what about the time when the CIA was actively involved in the drug trade?</p>
<p>People, wake up. Your government is corrupt as fuck. There is big business in the child-trafficking trade, and the Clintons jumped onto it. WAKE THE FUCK UP. Laura Silsby wasn't "accidentally" convicted, she was doing BIG BUSINESS.</p></p>

        <p><p>This type of post seems to be a common narrative today. "Stop looking, nothing to see here. You're all just crazy"</p>
<p>Its not fucking crazy if the evidence all lines up to tell a very concerning story. Numerous times these pedo rings have come up. A few of them have been shut down. Others weren't properly investigated, instead being dismissed just as this post is trying to make you do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do large-scale bad things get past the NSA? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would you expect that the NSA wasn't somehow implicated in this? They perform tons of behind the scenes illegal shit, along with the other intelligence agencies. This isn't an unknown or a "crazy idea", its literally the truth. One only needs to go back to when Snowden notified the world of the intricate operation to surveil much of the global communication traffic.</p>
<p>No one yet know how deep this problem goes and we honestly don't know exactly what the problem is that we are searching for. However, we know there is a problem, a lot of evidence seems to point toward a large pedo ring and other wrongdoings and we are trying piece it all together to find out what the fuck we are dealing with here. Closing your eyes and ears to the corruption and criminality does nothing to help anyone but those in power.</p></p>

        <p><p>USAID is the CIA and they are fully involved with the Clintons in Haiti. </p>
<p>https://www.usaid.gov/haiti/caracol-industrial-park</p>
<p>The CIA shut down the "Finders" investigation in '87 when international child trafficking was involved for huge amounts of money..</p>
<p>The CIA was named in Franklin through Michael Aquino. Ditto in Dutroux. </p>
<p>The FBI has tried to investigate these issues 2 or 3 times but is shut down by the CIA every time.</p>
<p>The CIA runs drugs into the country and works with drug cartels, we all know that.... what does this start to look like to you? No wonder the authorities don't investigate or arrest because the authorities are the perpetrators. </p></p>

<p>Are you referring to the NYPD? Couldn't they still do something? I'm pissed. There were leaks that an officer would hold his own press conference if charges were not brought. Even Blackwater founder Erik Prince said his sources told him the NYPD uncovered a major child sex ring/pedo stuff after getting Weiner's laptop.  Alex Jones had a P.I. on his show with physical evidence given to him by a source. </p>
<p>FBI reopens Clinton email investigation </p>
<p>Rumors start</p>
<p>FBI closes case</p>
<p>...And all these promises are M.I.A. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, but... </p>
<p>1987 - "The Finders" - FBI discovers massive syndicate of international child trafficking, blood rituals, probably programming. CIA takes over, it becomes an "internal matter" - nothing more is done. FBI investigation ends. </p>
<p>So the NYPD and FBI wouldn't be perpetrators here. It would be the factions like CIA who are drug running and etc, who are then making sure this is not investigated by other branches. If these cases ever showed up in court the evidence would lead to them &amp; the gov't isn't just going to merrily prosecute itself.</p>
<p>The Franklin case got close to this - it did go to court, Bonacci testified that the military (Aquino) was involved. The judge felt he was telling the truth; Bonacci received 1 million in damages. So in this one case the govt actually prosecuted itself to some degree. But in all these cases extreme measures have been taken to ensure real exposure does not sake place. The system enabling these crimes to continue stays in place. </p></p>

        <p><p>You nailed it. The Departed, Black Mass, End of Watch, Sicario... It's the same thing in any crime movie you've seen where the boss is protected. You only need the highest level of the Fed to be compromised to never make anything into an actual case. Look at Loretta Lynch. Once authority to prosecute goes to the higher level, a regular cop can't do shit.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yep, still waiting to hear something from the NYPD. You should check out the Alex Jones thing again. If I recall correctly, people have reverse image searched the censored image the P.I. showed and it appears to be a totally innocuous picture. Just trying to keep the potentially shaky leads separate from the more convincing evidence. I've been on the fence about Alex Jones' status for a couple of years now. Hard to tell sometimes if he's genuine, controlled opposition or kind of naive and therefore susceptible to shills feeding him misleading information to discredit him when he's onto a good lead. Anyway, just my two cents on Alex. Let's hope the NYPD manages to get that press conference rolling. One way or another, we've got to get the good guys in Law Enforcement to take a bigger role (you know, like doing their job?) with this investigation. </p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks for that. Reverse Image search = really disappointing if true. I've heard the controlled oppo about Alex as well and tend to think he's not, but I'll admit to having been really let down with some shit like 33,000 emails (Roger Stone too). At least Trump won without it, but if wikileaks had those emails....</p>
<p>For me, the fact that Erik PRINCE was talking about this to Alex Marlow really stood out.  He doesn't seem like a guy that fucks around (and being a Ron Paul fan I don't worship the guy by any measure). </p></p>

        <p><p>I'm still wrapping my head around the big picture here, but I'll try to explain the best I can. We live in an oligarchy. The rich and powerful control anything they want to control, from media, to human trafficking, movement of weapons to gain control of resources, drugs, technological innovation, medical innovation, all of it. If the pharmaceutical industry wants to keep treating people rather than curing them, they do it. If the oil industry wants to suppress green energy, it's suppressed. 
The rest of us, the ones that aren't a part of that very special club, we're wage slaves. Over and over we've been indoctrinated to believe the only way to have a good life is to work hard and keep handing money over to get it. Don't have an education? Fine, you get to work minimum wage and get shamed for taking subsidies because your job doesn't pay enough for you to feed yourself. Don't want to work a minimum wage job? Fine, you'll have to take out loans to go to college, which you'll then continue to pay for years after, you'll have to stay healthy to keep working which you'll have to pay for at ever-increasing costs, wages will stay stagnant and make it harder to purchase a home without taking out a bigger mortgage . . . it keeps people from moving higher up on the social ladder, which keeps that very special club exclusive to the people who have been there for decades.  The rest of us, well, as long as we stay complacent they can keep bleeding us dry while squashing the innovations that could completely change our society and humanity for the better, because they're still busy gathering up those all-important dolla dolla bills while they figure out how to control the next big industry. 
The rest of us are dispensable, disposable cogs in the wheel to be used as they see fit. Including our children. </p></p>

        <p><p>Child Trafficking is not limited to sex trafficking.</p>
<p>There are illegal adoption rings and baby factories.</p>
<p>There is organ trafficking which is a growing industry. It is becoming more profitable than drug trafficking for Mexican gangs. Children are targets as they are healthier. There is a culture being fostered - don't ask where the organs come from.</p>
<p>And there is child labor trafficking and exploitation. Manufacturing companies are moving off-shore to countries of low labor cost where children can be easily exploited. </p></p>

        <p><p>Slavery is a real problem too. Not as scandalous-sounding as sex trafficking, but still a huge deal. Like trafficking, it's easier to see it in third world countries. Idk to what extent it happens in the US, but I don't see any reason why it wouldn't exist here too.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's a simple thought exercise.  People in power are corrupt....A new agency opens....Do you think TPTB allowed a new agency to open to investigate them or do you think TPTB allowed a new agency to open to absolve them?  NSA knows about aliens and energy...I am convinced of this, it's probably too conspiracy right now for this sub, but in a few months, I think we are going to be having a very big discussion on the world around us.  People are awake but they have only just hit their alarm clock.  Time to get out of bed and realize there is much much more than pizzagate.  But first, lets bring down the pedos and then we can keep digging</p></p>

<p>There are hundreds of government officials that have testified as eyewitnesses and thousands of official government documents.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, this is 60+ years of history, and is not something that can be explained in 2 minutes. You will have to take the information available to you, and do your own research. I've provided a handful of links above, these are good points of reference and include verifiable persons and legitimate testimony on the matter.</p>
<p>However, I agree, this sub is not the place for this discussion.</p>
<p>The simple fact, is that these pedorings have been exposed THREE times before, Dutroux and Jimmy Saville, plus the Hollywood ring. This does not even get into the Army base in SF. Each and every time, it was swept under the rug, and those exposed were convicted and served little/no jail time.</p>
<p>This is not something new, this has been going on for a long time. At this point, I don't see anything happening, because nothing has ever happened when this has been exposed before.</p></p>

        <p><p>The only tie-in is that Podesta was interested in disclosure, and one of the emails between Dr. Edward Mitchell and him show they met to discuss this on at least one occasion.</p>
<p>Other than that, just a mountain of evidence that says the government is lying to the public. Which, IMHO, is more believable than anything else.</p></p>

        <p><p>If CIA/NSA agents, government employees, elected officials, world leaders testimonies and corresponding declassified documents do not provide sufficient evidence, then nothing will.</p>
<p>There is less evidence in these emails, why are you even here if you dismiss evidence placed in front of you?</p>

        <p><p>I think what he's saying is that, while not disagreeing with you, those types of connections are discussed outside of pizzagate. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I do see what you're saying, and think they are valid points, but I also agree that they should be outside of the pizzagate sub.</p>
<p>Keep on searching for the truth. </p></p>

        <p><p>The thought police are what allowed this to be swept under the rug this long. Thanks for the concern though. BTW, the NYT has their own agenda, regardless of how much truth comes to light, you won't hear about it from the media. Think for yourself and keep pulling the thread. I'm not crazy and you're not crazy. We've been told to only think so far about so much...Keep digging, it goes deeper. Or if you don't want to keep digging, fine. Expose the pedo stuff and then keep on exposing the rest. In the end you and I are in this together. Careful telling your fellow man not to think too much, it's very dangerous</p></p>

        <p><p>The CIA is at war with the NSA because of the extreme technological capabilities of the NSA. Snowden was a CIA plant, designed to discredit the NSA and hopefully dismantle them due to public outrage. That didn't happen but the CIA knows they know everything. </p>
<p>I believe free energy is part of it. I believe this child trafficking stuff is largely connected to mkultra. The CIA needed 100s, if not 1000s, of young test subjects to perform their experiments. Many did not survive. Maybe the ones that "fail" are given back to the pedo rings. </p>
<p>Successfully mind controlled victims are can be sex agents (mostly female) or agents to participate in other experiments, like Project Montauk. Project Montauk is the supposed real life experiment that Stranger Things is based off of. People claim that they successfully developed time travel, as well as possibly teleportation and the ability to create mental super humans. </p>
<p>Whats funny is that Tesla was supposedly involved in Project Montauk. Tesla has his footprints all over these conspiracies that I believe to be connected. Coupled with the Tesla/Trump time traveller theory, and the FBI's tweet about Tesla, I really truly believe that big things are going to be happening soon. </p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>right..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you really believe that Snowden worked 5 years for CIA, during wich he was in Switzerland with the Banker. Where they got the banker drunk. got him to drive home and called the cops on him. And then the kicker. Snowden was so disturbed by this "strategy"(like if CIA doesnt do worse things on a daily basis?) that he joined NSA some years later and was given all the access (cause heck, NSA just loves prior CIA guys), and decided to drop a BOMB of NSA secrets? It really makes sense. Doesnt it?</p></p>

<p>This guy is like some hybrid cuck. You've only got one eye open. You've lost depth perception as a result, so you fail to see how deep this really goes. It's simple: If they're capable of covering up their <em>passtime</em> of pedophilia like this, what else are they covering up that's not "just jokes", as Alefantis would say.</p></p>

        <p><p>So you question someone's claim, then dismiss their response's entire argument wholesale?</p>
<p>Credibility comes from taking in all data objectively and being able to reason about it properly, not by emotionally thumping some arbitrary subset of talking points. You're hurting your own cause.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's important not for information to be true or false, it's important for it to be believable.</p>
<p>Whatever that means; Pizzagate is 'dangerous' as it can condition us to not be surprised by possible 'very out there' realities and possible truths.</p>
<p>To summarise in a sentence; the very out there potential realities about how our planet is compromised.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yep, the real disinformation is that which tells us everything is exactly as it seems and there is nothing to look into.  It goes against the very nature of humans.  We are curious and want to know more.  What motivation is there to tell us not to look into the occult, or aliens, or energy, etc etc?  What harm would it do to flip over the rock and see if there is anything under there?</p></p>

        <p><p>If multiple members of government from all over the world are involved in 'Pizzagate' (speaking broadly), then you know, logically there has to be something very psychologically extreme going on for there to be a culture around something so horrible to children.</p>
<p>Investigating these leads is what allows us to not make insane and baseless accusations, and is what allows us to come up with a hypothesis based on logic and reason which involve the criminally insane. Regardless of using emotion to justify either way possible thought-patterns I.E; "This can't be true / false because it's insane." </p></p>

        <p><p>It doesn't seem so complicated to me. Multiple studies have shown that those in positions of power are disproportionately likely to be sociopaths. Sociopaths with power and riches would absolutely use it to explore their dark fantasies (murder, torture, rape, etc.).</p></p>

        <p><p>This whole ordeal that have surfaced the last couple of weeks is beyond insane! This has probably been going on for over 50 years and won't stop in any near future - We can only do so much to share and spread the word but the people are not ready to even try comprehending this shit! All the people i have told about this is either not believing me or isn't taking this seriously at all... The same way they ridiculed the people who said Jimmy Saville was raping children and corpses, when he died the truth came to the surface and he had been responsible for around 600 children getting molested.
The general public is so fucking mindboggingly ignorant and dumb!
I can't express how much this frustrates me... But in the end the truth will prevail!</p></p>

        <p><p>Zoom out even further. Learn about the following names:</p>
<p>Aaron McCollum
Max Spiers
James Casbolt
Malcolm Pauly</p>
<p>Example: Aaron McCollum on the 8 reasons for military abductions, pay attention to points 6,7 and 8.</p>
<p>https://supersoldiertalk.com/2016/05/19/eight-reasons-for-military-abductions/</p>
<p>There are various reasons for abducting people. I think Pizzagate points towards McCollum's points 6/7/8.</p></p>

        <p><p>In my opinion if we follow the logic of avoiding direct exposure to the truth in an effort to cover this up, it stands to reason that if it debunked this sub it would not be allowed here either for the risk of turning people toward the "truth". No matter what the "conspiracy" the blanket statement of conspiracy theory is enough to deter people just because of the shameful skewed thinking that's become associated with it. </p>
<p>It's also interesting how you choose a top down debunking attempt, or is this nyt article the only thing that makes you question the mentality of this sub? </p></p>

        <p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Control fixation.  Power trips are sexy to far more people than children, and far more likely to be appealing to all the richest most powerful people in the world than pedophilia as such.</p>
<p>Just a guess.</p>
<p>Another guess might be that they're using it as a "secret handshake" to ensure loyalty within a select group.  The key of silence could be the tears of a forsaken child.  That sounds like the kind of occult bullshit a secret society would go for.</p></p>

        <p><p>Clinton's email server was running the OS with the worst track record on security, MacOSX. I'd be surprised if everyone didn't hack it a few times over. MacOSX security updates were historically released <em>with paid OS upgrades</em> only. Worse yet, they are old and vulnerable versions of well known open source software.</p></p>

        <p><p>i think its also important to remember that i dont think this is NSAs remit, is it? they do see this and no doubt inform FBI or w/e but they are the ones who arent doing anything / whos hands are tied by DoJ</p>
<p>this does give credibility that snowden was a CIA plant in order to destroy NSA - the only ones who see the truth but cant do anything about it. I imagine NSA has the toughest anti leaking measures which could only be countered with help (e.g. CIA helping Snowden). </p>
<p>There is that to think about </p></p>

        <p><p>Have you considered that A) with the amount of noise on the Internet it's probably not difficult to stay under the NSAs radar if they're not already looking for you, and B) most of those million kids are in third world countries where the NSA is either not interested or interested for reasons more related to national security.</p>
<p>you don't need to be an expert cryptographer either to use end to end encryption.</p></p>

        <p><p>For me the big picture is that this world isn't as diverse as we see it.  Behind the scenes, there is a group running everything.    </p>
<p>Now this is a theory based on history and past events, experiences, things I've read and what have you.   I think there are politicians and people of power in this group, that are puppets or are being used.   There's a large number of those.  I think there are only a few that are actually running the show.   </p>
<p>I think the CIA has a big hand in a lot of the things that go on in this world, I think they do this to make sure the power stays in the hands of these people.  I think these people started this before the CIA was a thing, and created it.   </p>
<p>For example, 9/11.  I have believed for the longest time that it wasn't just a terrorist attack, that we had some hand in it.  I think it was allowed to happen so Bush could get what he needed to take out Saddam.   Taking out Saddam allowed freedom in that area per se, rebel groups instead of everything being run by one etc.   Cue them arming ISIS and all the other shit that's happened.  All this so that the balance never tips too far to one area.    </p>
<p>Now,  if this all dismantles, I think there might be chaos for a while.  Cause there might not be a leader.  Maybe not this country but others.  So there might be fights and worse.    Even thought that would be bad, I think it is something we need..a restart.   Because the way we are being controlled is crazy.  </p>
<p>Now, we have way more people than they do, they know this and that's why there has been this segregation for so long.  If we unite, we can take them down.  I think they have a fail safe of course, nukes or something.   So as crazy as it sounds, I think we should be planning for that outcome, so my fellow tin foils, load up on ammo, weapons and provisions for future survival.   </p>
<p>Now as a final note,  I think the balance or should I say one sided power in this world is very important to the people who have that power.   I think they will go to great lengths to prevent themselves from losing it and I don't think they would do anything drastic until the very end.  So there's quite a bit of time yet.  But I do think that with technology where it is now and how easy people can talk to each other, that we're closer to that point then we have ever been.  So don't give up the fight, lets make this a global change.   It's time to give the world back to the people.                   </p></p>

        <p><p>This is basic persuasion format. </p>
<p>Any time you see someone make the following format, assume they have an agenda:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pose question you'd likely ask yourself under given circumstances.</p>
<p>Answer to that question which follows the same narrative all the way through.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conclusion is the NSA is bad. All of their premises conclude that the NSA is the only faculty which doesn't have dirt. For all we know, they could be the ones leaking/digging the deepest.</p>
<p>This is clearly an attack on the NSA. Go read any persuasion article ever. Plenty of them use this format.</p></p>

        <p><p>Frankly, I'm not really concerned by "making myself" not look "sketchy" to you, whoever you are. I made my point, which was basically "pizzagate shows how big bad things only exist because the govt is paid off, which big bad things might there be?" Then you came in incoherently rambling about how this is how "they" create a narrative or whatever. Because the shills want everyone to think the govt is even worse, right?</p></p>

        <p><p>I was following on another account and made a throwaway when an article in the NYT that was posted here was instantly, IMMEDIATELY discredited as evidence that the NYT was "implicated" in some fashion. Regardless of the fact that the sub reddit is directly mentioned. Regardless of the fact that, if there was some grand coverup plot, they would probably never mention all the things that they do so directly because if there was concern about the truth being so obvious that they anyone who looks here would see obvious evidence that would implicate higher ups, they'd be exposing all their readers to the truth, right?</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm stunned, honestly. I knew I'd be accused of this kind of thing, called a shill etc. but you're accusing me of, I'm assuming, working (as in, getting paid), to spread false information? Based on what? </p>
<p>Peace, y'all. You're going to dig your own graves on this one. Maybe it won't be pizza gate, but if this pattern of anti-intellectualism and cult-like groupthink continues in this movement, it's only going to be a matter of time before the line between the truth and the flat out lies is indistinguishable in your minds and you're going to be manipulated by people who know they only have to say enough to satiate your biases. It's kind of already there and it's really sad.</p></p>

        <p><p>Good riddance. There was so much intellectual content to bite into in your posts /s. "It can't be true, you guys are all nuts". Pardon us for not giving an exegesis of your shit. </p>
<p>Paid or not you are hurting more than you help. Talking about optics and groupthink lol while people here are earnestly trying to unearth child abuse. For shame. </p>
<p>Take your stunned butthurt feelings somewhere else. Maybe the NYT will help us with our groupthink soon with their quality articles. /s Fuckwit</p></p>

<p>EDIT: It's also possible if he was on the whole alt-right smear that he's just a hyper lefty who still has Hillary butthurt, but yeah good riddance either way. </p>
<p>EDIT2: The thing that set him off was not being called fuckface, but being called a shill. Weird.</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>IDK, I tend to think it would be the opposite.  A shill account doesn't care if they are wrong, they don't get angry or embarrassed if they are bested, they are unflappable and resilient because they have no emotional investment in their writing.  They would hang around, arguing and insisting and debating, if for no other reason than to seem busy to their employers.  </p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that the assertions contained in your first edit are probably closer to the truth.  This is most likely just some leftist who stumbled upon this place and felt like they had to put their two cents in.  You know how their kind loves to 'let their voice be heard', with all the attention whoring, virtue signaling garbage that they love so much.</p></p>

        <p><p>You referenced that smear in the NYT as something that ought to be evidence and you're <em>surprised</em> to be called out for spreading disinfo?  You're not a shining star of intellectualism here.  Quite the opposite.  Break the pattern.  You're stuck in confirmation bias and projecting it to those who have more open minds.</p></p>

        <p><p>Look up the origin of the word "holocaust". Ask yourself why the Nazis styled themselves after a certain Catholic order and enjoyed great cooperation with the RCC. The notion that the Jewish laity somehow deserved to be slaughtered and burned is gross, don't be surprised if people are put off this</p></p>

        <p><p>Well I won't argue it here and muddy up everything. If you wanna say there's an esoteric history of WWII, I'm on board. If your conclusion is "jews did it and they deserved to be slaughtered and burned" I am on a very different page, not only in opinion but interpretation of the facts. Stop thinking religion vs. religion, start thinking esoteric vs. exoteric across the board. </p></p>
