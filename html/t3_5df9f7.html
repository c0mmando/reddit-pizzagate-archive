        <p><p>This about the Franklin cover up? Seen it a while ago. It suddenly all made sense regarding how people at the top of society can get away with everything (key positions at the media, justice dep. and grand juries). Here in Holland we have our own coverups, probably as with any nation. </p></p>

        <p><p>Positions of power attract the corrupt and corruptable, and those with evil intent actively seek these positions for obvious reasons. </p>
<p>Shit like this happens in every power structure, across the globe- regardless of race, culture, or ideology. </p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>Conspiracy of Silence is a 56-minute unreleased documentary film produced by Yorkshire Television in 1994.</p>
<p>The subject of the film is an alleged child sexual abuse ring involving a number of prominent Nebraska persons, including Lawrence King, an Omaha banker, political fundraiser, and convicted felon.</p>
<p>The documentary was scheduled for broadcast in the United States on cable outlet Discovery Channel on May 3, 1994.</p>
<p>However, it was never aired. Proponents of the film claim that it was withdrawn due to political pressure; neither Yorkshire Television nor Discovery Channel commented officially on why it was not aired.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's from here: http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/conspiracy-of-silence/</p>
<p>There should be a wikipedia entry on this film, there isn't one now: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_of_silence</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes that's the main story. I'm just wondering why the film itself never had a wikipedia entry made.</p></p>
