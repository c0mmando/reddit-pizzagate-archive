        <strong>Scared to dig any deeper.</strong>
        <p><p>At a point where I believe in all of the pizzagate information, but who's to say I start digging deeper and the very fucks involved arrest me for pedophilia.  Is this how they are able to keep the lid shut so tight on this?</p></p>

        <p><p>Okay, but apparently the department of Justice is involved with Comet Ping Pong.  Couldn't they decide to TRY and arrest us all?  There's a lot of us looking though.  Just some food for thought. </p></p>

        <p><p>I figured it out last night, google's really just a shitty disinformation algorithm. These types of websites seem to literally be all over the web, I had no idea. I've been coming across lots of crazy shit https://www.bubblegenius.com/faq/. They're not as powerful as you think, all of their power is in making you think they're bigger and more powerful than they actually are. It's a crazy rabbit hole I'm not sure where the exit is. It clicked when I remembered one of my professors claimed to create the "google" algorithm. It's essentially a sparse matrix that's designed to look infinite, but really just a ranked list of websites to feed you the highest one up that's able to match what you typed in. </p></p>

        <p><p>I think you're right. While it's technically possible to have root kits in the BIOS of our laptops and track our phone locations... I don't think they're doing that yet except maybe in special cases. Whatever, either way imma keep digging. I gave all my fucks long ago, have none left to give. Only time I'm nervous is traveling. Airports sketch me out.</p></p>

        <p><p>Have worried about this too, especially when it first began, but by now there's thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of people that have gone down this hole to some extent and it's still relatively new, so I'm sure many more will follow.</p>
<p>No way they could arrest everyone / stop it altogether, and even if they tried, word would get out. Plus, the majority of us actually aren't even doing anything illegal at all, but rather just viewing information that was already made public by the perpetrators anyway. Nothing yet (to my knowledge) is overtly pornographic or contains anything we could potentially get busted for. It's all very circumstantial and certainly weird / dark, but there's nothing overtly criminal in and of itself that we possess or that should give you reason to worry about that. We're only speculating, on one very particular case, and it should be clear by everything we say and research that we are avidly against this type of behavior to begin with (not proponents of it). </p>
<p>Right now, their best bet is just to keep censoring, not make large scale arrests, so I wouldn't worry too hard about it. Do be careful downloading anything though.</p></p>
