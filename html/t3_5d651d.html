        <p><p>I mean in the comments section.  It will simply detract from our credibility and lend credence to the pedophile/pedo-enabler James Alefantis. </p></p>

        <p><p>Well, JimmyComet has clearly tried to politicize the issue with his comments in the article. But the issue is 100% non-partisan and let's keep it that way. Criticism of JimmyComet's politicization of the issue in his most recent interview is allowed because it's clearly diversionary. But as always this sub is non-partisan and generally non-conspiratorial. </p></p>

        <p><p>I mean specifically on the comments section on their website (theirs being washingtoncitypaper.com).  Politicizing it in those comments will just fulfill the premise the article is trying to create.</p></p>

        <p><p>Definitely. Why anyone would go to their social media or seek out their online presence to post anything related to this is completely beyond me. Maybe I'm old? "Trolling" came after me. It doesn't serve any purpose. </p></p>

        <p><p>Look at the guy that runs the pizzagate IG for an example of what happens when an idiot takes to social media with an agenda outside of disseminating factual information.</p></p>
