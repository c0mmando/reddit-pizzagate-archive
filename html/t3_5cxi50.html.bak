        <strong>Ok, can someone give me a summary of pizzagate?</strong>
        <p><p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I saw that logo that resembles the pedo symbolism, but thought this was just a stupid coincidence. But after seeing a post showing the police drawings of two suspects looking like the Podesta, I'm deeply disturbed. ( I even had to check if the sketches are authentic - they are - http://abcnews.go.com/International/maddy-mccann-cops-release-sketches-kidnap-suspects/story?id=20563026 )</p>
<p>So for someone new here, it's hard to get an overview of the hot clues... maybe someone can give me an overview and tell me how I can help.</p></p>

        <p><p>A proper summary would take a few hours honestly. There is so much data that people have dug up here and are still continuing to find.</p>
<p>I'll write a proper summary when i have more time.</p>
<p>On another note, I HAVE MADE TWO THREADS IN THIS SUBREDDIT IN THE PAST 3 HOURS AND NONE OF THEM ARE SHOWING IN THE SUBREDIT. NOT EVEN IN "NEW". Is this normal or is the subreddit compromised to that extent?</p></p>

        <p><p>I've posted a Simon Parkes video (dont crusify me for this, ive only linked it for people who hit an emotional low because of the stuff that was being unveiled to get their spirits up, as it did for me) where he discuses whats going on behind the sceens with the election, military, FBI NYPD regarding the satanic child abuse.</p>
<p>Ive also posted a video of Switzerland tunnel opening ceremony with Merkel, Holande, Renzo and EU elites attending that is quite obviously a satanism and occult parade. Giving how all of this pedo stuff has an occult overtone to it I tought some people would appreciate the video. Here it is: </p>

        <p><p>The tunnel opening looks like an average modern dance performance. Honestly linking that to satanism is a bit far fetched.</p></p>

        <p><p>to keep it short and sweet, basically theres a fuckton of evidence in regards to the possibility that the clintons and the DNC are running a satanic underground pedophile sex trafficking ring via certain pizza joints.</p>
<p>in john podestas' email leak there were certain emails where it sounded like they were speaking in code, because they didnt make a lick of sense. So, through extensive research and hypothesis', its widely assumed that they were speaking about fucking children and satanism.</p>
<p>There is also a lot more people involved besides The Clintons and he DNC. </p>
<p>i recommend reading this post on tumblr to get the basic gist of it  http://libertarian--princess.tumblr.com/post/152795520911/libertarianprincess-libertarianprincess</p>
<p>and heres a list of links for more reading</p>

        <p><p>Well, I just read the first link. All this talking about pizza is wired and the way the terms pizza, pasta and hot dogs are used makes it really likely that that are code words for something else. </p>
<p>Having all this strange connections to symbols, persons involved in shady things makes me speechless.</p>
<p>My mind is repelled from believing that there is a pedophile ring including so many high level people  sharing a sick perversion...I really want to dismiss this as the most insane conspiracy theory I have ever heard of. But after reading this, it's hard to dismiss it.</p></p>

        <p><p>believe me, i know its messed up.
i found it hard to believe at first as well. its extremely messed up, and unfortunately, probably true. So much evidence has been compiled that even if what everyones saying isnt EXACTLY correct, something sinister and fishy is still going on, whether the Clintons are involved or not.</p>
<p>anyways, look through the sub and read all you can to get more info. </p></p>

        <p><p>I'm going to follow that case closely and hopefully in the end it turns out that this is just a bug misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Imagine that damage this would do to our society if it turns out to be true...</p>
<p>Thanks for the information, mate!</p></p>
