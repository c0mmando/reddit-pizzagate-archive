        <strong>Weird stuff in a Banks Vault</strong>
        <p><p>I was watching this Youtube vid, when satan and hell was mentioned a couple of times on the wall. At min 3:42 u see a "Pizza" Graffiti on the wall. The entrance to the vault was marked with arrows and the word hell, it's kinda crazy. Check the first part frome these 2 videos for some satan related graffities.

        <p><p>This has nothing to do with pizzagate, which is an investigation specifically into the Clinton Foundation and its associates being part of a child trafficking ring. </p>
<p>Not every occurrence of the term 'pizza' is automatically suspect. </p></p>
