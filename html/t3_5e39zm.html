        <p><p>FBI Anon could be literally anyone. Why is it we are so quick to take the word of anyone on a site deliberately designed to be anonymous?</p>
<p>I  not saying the story is false but people keep jumping down rabbit holes void of critical thinking and this article doesn't persuade me otherwise. </p>
<p>We risk being baffled by bullshit.</p></p>

        <p><p>The blogospere is a crap shoot. Sometimes they are ahead of the game and legit but more often than not theyre just putting up BS to get clicks.... if you get 100k views a month you could be pulling $3k+ in ad revenue so the incentive to make shit up for clicks is definitely there</p></p>

        <p><p>FBI agent or not, he had outstanding insight into the state of current affairs at the time, assuming it's the same person posting, which leads me to take the information he gave with more than a grain of salt. Still though, stay wary.</p></p>

<p>The info could come from a shill, though, and needs checking. </p></p>

        <p><p>She might be his "granddaughter", but that doesn't mean she is birth or blood related.  </p>
<p>They could have adopted her after the abduction, (they have the means and connections to do it if they wanted).</p>
<p>They could just call her their granddaughter, even if she never legally got adopted.</p>
<p>It's a lot easier to take a complacent sex slave on trips with you if she is called your "granddaughter".  (Or niece, etc.)</p></p>

        <p><p>The  girl in the photo with the cards IS NOT MADELINE MCMANN. It is John Podesta's granddaughter... how many times do we have to say it? </p>
<p>She is the daughter of Megan Rouse, John's daughter. The picture of them playing cards is clearly just that... them playing cards. </p>
<p>Not saying pizzagate isn't real, I'm almost sure it is. But you've gotta think a little more clearly. </p></p>

        <p><p>Gerry McCann had a child protective services file opened before Madeleine ever went missing, but mysteriously the contents were blank (i.e. wiped).</p>
<p>Also, their friend David Payne, who was on the trip, had a file as well.</p>
<p>There is a statement to police from people they had dinner with in Portugal that Gerry and David talked about Madeleine at dinner and made crude blow job motions when talking about her - I think their name is Gaspar. It's on the internet for anyone to read.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think I've heard that as well - but it may have been from when the McCanns were on Oprah or some other TV special.</p>
<p>There are some good websites/forums that archive every article, police report, etc.  Jill Havern is one (just google the name and you'll see it). You may be able to find a copy of the article on there. </p></p>

        <p><p>Most parents would say their child is gone, or missing, or even simply "not in their bed/the condo" - not that someone's taken them. That's your worst fear, and you wouldn't voice that because it's too horrible.</p></p>

        <p><p>How has nobody bothered to check that those efits were made of the same suspect, not two...? Not trying to put a damper on this piece of evidence but the police clearly stated in a summarizing article I read about the McCann case the efits were of the same suspect.</p></p>

<p>efit photos compared to the podestas photos are fucking mind blowing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except for a few teensy problems.</p>
<p>Firstly the two pictures are two different versions of one person's recollection of one person. Not two people.</p>
<p>Secondly the Podestas were way older than that person of interest.</p>
<p>Thirdly police say they interviewed and cleared that person of interest.</p>
<p>This is just idiots on the internet seeing shapes in clouds.</p></p>

        <p><p>My guess is that people's memories and ability to describe faces are just not that good. So if you do the same process twice you are not guaranteed to get results more similar than, say, the degree to which two brothers look alike.</p></p>

        <p><p>AH HA! Incriminating, isn't it, that we're having trouble determining where he was! Sorry, going back to real digging...</p></p>

        <p><p>I can see having problems figuring out his location on a random day almost 10 years ago, but I am a little surprised that we cannot figure out a definitive YES/NO if they were in the country.  Oh well.  I'm not fixated on the Podestas being involved in Madeline's disappearance, but I thought that could at least open or shut the door on looking in to it</p></p>

        <p><p>Don't know if he was out of the country, but he was definitely out of the office on the day after Madeline was kidnapped.  His email account was being used by someone named Elizabeth.  </p>

<p>look at the attachment of this  email and tell me that isn't John Podesta's daughter Megan Rouse emailing pictures of the same girl (her daughter) about the first day of school. THIS IS NOT MADDIE MCMANN. You idiots are so easy to jump at any conclusion with no evidence.</p>
<p>There is no reason to believe that these photos show maddie mcmann. </p>
<p>We have leads with definite merit. Epstein, Silsby, Haiti, Monica Peterson, Comet and Alefantis, etc. This is not one of them. </p></p>

<p>Podesta somehow kills/loses daughter/grand daughter. Buys/steals a replacement.</p>
<p>Main give away would be in the eye. I can't see it there.</p></p>

        <p><p>It was in the emails. John had received an email from someone asking how Portugal was 
. Dates matched up with the disappearance. Would like to see evidence that they had rented the Villa tho </p></p>

        <p><p>I have been very actively following the Podesta emails and pizzagate since day one, and I have never seen such an email. Source?</p>
<p>There is an email that puts Podesta in Portugal during the same month...but 7 years later. </p>
<p>The most "incriminating" things in the emails (as far as I know), is that Podesta seemingly deleted ALL his emails prior to the exact day Maddie was taken.</p>
<p>Podesta was also apparently indisposed during the Maddie disappearance timeframe, as Podesta had an assistant write his emails for him for a bit after the disappearance.</p></p>

        <p><p>Is there a possibility that they travel there every year around the same time for some sort of Satanic ritual? I know as a Jew for me that we keep Passover around the same time every year, but not the same exact dates. Same with Christians keeping Easter, Christmas and what not. </p></p>

<p>The girl in the card picture is NOT MADDIE MCMANN. PLEASE stop saying this. It is an utterly false and foolish proposition that has no evidence to back it up. Follow the leads that have evidence. This one has been a dead end for weeks. </p></p>
