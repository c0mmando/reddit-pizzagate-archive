        <p><p><strong>Ed Kramer, a convicted pedophile and co-creator of DragonCon, had many people in the community who swore there was no way he was molesting children even before his trial, which Kramer kept delaying because of health issues.</strong>

<p><strong>No surprise he had many cheerleaders who blamed the court system. The National Center for Reason and Justice was one of them, and their main focus is defending those who have been accused of abusing children and countering charges of Satanic Ritual Abuse.</strong></p>
<p>"NCRJ President Michael Snedeker is a criminal-defense lawyer who has successfully handled the appeals of ritual abuse cases in California.[citation needed] He is author of the California State Prisoners Handbook and co-author with Debbie Nathan of Satan's Silence: Ritual Abuse and the Making of a Modern American Witch Hunt.[1]</p>

        <p><p>Please note that I'm not saying that everyone isn't deserving of defense during a trial, but it troubles me that this group seems to completely discount that Satanic Ritual Abuse happens, and it appears that this is one of the main subjects they focus upon.</p></p>

        <p><p>Checking out Nathan's book Satan's Silence on Amazon, this review stuck out to me.

"I checked this out from the library, and will now buy a copy.</p>
<p>I remember a situation of claimed preschool ritual sex abuse.</p>
<p>There were confused statements of being dragged down into a</p>
<p>cave...etc. The staff and owners were found innocent, but left</p>
<p>Arizona.</p>
<p>Funny thing, the building was razed for redevelopement a couple of</p>
<p>years ago. A weird cavelike cellar was discovered.</p>
<p>Take eveything you read with a grain of salt, but don't be so quick to disbelieve the strange and weird."</p></p>

        <p><p>This is an excerpt from a very long, but fascinating article that appears to be extremely unbiased as far as I can tell.

"“More people [in the United States] believe in UFOs than in ritual abuse,” said Linda Wallace Pate, a Los Angeles attorney who represents child abuse victims. “When you talk about black robes and human sacrifices, the case goes out the window.” 16</p>
<p>Ritual child abuse was found in as many as 13 percent of child abuse allegations at day-care centers, according to a 1988 study by David Finkelhor, a prominent University of New Hampshire researcher. And when two reporters for the Memphis Commercial Appeal surveyed 24 investigations of ritual abuse from 1983-87, they found that 91 people had been arrested and charged, of whom 23 were convicted of some type of child abuse, though many convictions were later reversed. 17</p>
<p>Proof that there are Satanic child sex rings, however, remains elusive. At an American Psychological Association conference in August 1991, a doctor downplayed their likelihood, speculating that such allegations were the result of sensationalized memories or errors in treatment.</p>
<p>FBI behavioral sciences specialist Kenneth Lanning told the conference that “in spite of years of intensive effort, law enforcement has been unable to uncover any evidence of a cult network, or any proof that ritualistic abuse is occurring....Any professional evaluating victims' allegations of ritualistic abuse cannot ignore the lack of physical evidence, the difficulty in successfully committing a large-scale conspiracy and human nature.” 18</p>
<p>Whether the movement against child abuse has been spurred by hysteria boils down to the number of false accusations. Experts agree that hard data on the subject are scarce. Child psychiatrist David Jones in a 1985 study of 576 allegations of child sexual abuse found less than 2 percent of the charges from children and 6 percent from adults to be false.</p>
<p>“Every indication is that the problem of false allegations is quite rare,” writes Conte. “When false allegations do occur, they appear most often to be the results of some adult's actions, not a child's.” </p></p>
