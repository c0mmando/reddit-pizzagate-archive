        <p><blockquote>
<p>Summary : Adoption related fraud in Vietnam is a large and growing problem. The combination of a decentralized administrative system, a legal framework that lacks procedures for oversight and accountability, and an unregulated donation system have combined to produce an adoption system rife with fraud and child selling. In interviews with consular officers, 75% of parents have stated that they received payment from the orphanage in exchange for placing their child in the orphanage. On average this payment was six million Vietnamese Dong, which is the equivalent of 11 months salary at minimum wage in Vietnam. Throughout Vietnam, officials at orphanages connected with international adoptions report that the number of deserted children has increased by up to 1700% since 2005, the year that the adoption agreement with the United States was signed. Vietnamese officials have told the Embassy that "these desertions would not occur if the United States stopped issuing visas for the adoption of Vietnamese children." Embassy investigations have uncovered multiple cases of children being offered for international adoption without their birth parents consent, after the birth parents failed to pay hospital bills for the children. Despite the documented abuses, the Department of International Adoption has acknowledged that it has not taken any action, criminal or administrative, against any individual or organization for any violation of Vietnamese law or regulation concerning adoption.

        <p><p>Okay... what the fuck? Seriously, what the fuck are they doing with these fucking kids? Are they raping and sex trading all of them? They have hundreds of thousands of potential children,  when you consider this, Haiti and all the other ways we know they have used to aquire children. This is insane. Are they killing some? All? </p></p>

        <p><p>Human sacrifice, they rape them using masks fill the child with adrenaline and terror then drink their blood to gain their vitality and supposedly get high off of it.</p>
<p>the ones that let them rape and don't complain probably last longer than the ones that resist, their fate becomes the above.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's speculation at this point but I saw the comet pizza picture were they have 3 kneeling people wearing masks and I saw "EYES WIDE SHUT" by Kubrick which they say got him killed for revealing too much of the elites lifestyle. Obviously in the film the girls are over 18 which we are beginning to consider isn't true especially with epstein and his lolita express.</p>
<p>Either way if you want a film portrayal of that lifestyle watch eyes wide shut, it's a good movie by a good director. </p></p>

        <p><p>yep but they would want to indulge in their flesh and blood quicker he /she wouldn't be a good enough captive and he /she would be set as an example to the other children to behave. They probably take multiple and sacrifice just one they also will have their favorites imo. Some may even be adopted and "saved" so the kids feel there is a way out. I'm talking on hypothetical terms on what is the most absolute evil way to deal with those children psychologically. </p></p>

        <p><p>6 million VND is about $266 at current rates.  </p>
<p>Remember that Comet instagram photo "German baby - $1200" and the comment "too expensive" or whatever? Makes sense in context, doesn't it. </p></p>

        <p><p>Apparently the top 2 organizations to adopt kids from Vietnam are: </p>
<p>1) http://www.holtinternational.org/vietnam/</p>
<p>2) https://www.dillonadopt.com/vietnam/</p>
<p>Also found this, Rainbow Kids adoption service (kind of looks like a global adoption marketplace):</p>
<p>http://image.prntscr.com/image/5dfe71a69024456eb2d9a78c02c6ef8f.png</p>
<p>More stuff: </p>
<p>http://archive.is/wiuRZ</p>
<p>U.S. is ranked 12th among the countries that have adopted the most Vietnamese children.</p>
<p>From 2011 through 2013, 1,234 Vietnamese children were adopted by foreign parents, according to an April report from the Ministry of Justice. More than half of the children were adopted by parents from France, Canada, Italy and Spain. That included 366 children with disabilities and fatal illnesses.</p>
<p>http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/367606.html</p>
<p>^ Very good information on Korean Adoption issues</p>
<p>Seems like human trafficking under the guise of adoption is a worldwide problem:</p>

        <p><p>This reminds me of those videos of the 15yr old named Teresa. It was an Australian 60 minutes episode, "Satan's Children" from 1989. She survived but it sounded like it was becoming more common. They were sacrificing children and using them for breeding.</p></p>

        <p><p>I showed that video to someone the other day. I almost started crying. The whole time she is talking about what happened to her there, she is completely emotionless- like she has numbed herself emotionally to it all, except for when she starts talking about her baby. That's the only time she starts tearing up. This whole thing is so fucking sad :(</p></p>

        <p><p>Don't forget contemporary medical research regarding this. Seriously. (Alot of which is unknown, to us, the public of course). I wonder how large the discrepancy is between contemporary public/private knowledge. But keep the medical component in mind. </p>

        <p><p>Yeah no doubt in my mind (just based on logic), that there is some connection to (bio-)medical research here. It would make a lot of sense in my imho. Stem cell research and a way for a large "input". Seems convenient. </p></p>
