        <p><p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5colcw/lenfant_cafe_home_to_boum_boum_room/">This</a> is the original post. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/health-code-violations-in-the-district-maryland-and-virginia/2016/11/07/34e0f5a0-a440-11e6-8fc0-7be8f848c492_story.html">This</a> is the link to the Washington Post - <a href="http://archive.is/vGW7X">archive</a>. Article on WP site is dated Nov 7 2016, closure of L'Enfant Café said to have occurred on Nov 1 because of "gross unsanitary conditions, including vermin."</p>
<p>The article is real, and Café L'Enfant in DC has indeed been tied to the pedoring. Why is this being downvoted? It's mildly relevant - seems to be a pretext to rapidly close shop. Also the mention of "vermin" is ironic.</p></p>

        <p><p>Thank you for helping clear this up u/aify26! </p>
<p>To everyone else, I am NOT A SHILL, just here to give any info I come across. I stupidly posted the link from the Google results, rather than directly from Washington Post, so it was called out as 'not legit.' </p>
<p>This username is brand new because it is a throwaway. I have found more info I feel is relevant, but haven't posted due to being called a shill and down-voted.</p></p>
