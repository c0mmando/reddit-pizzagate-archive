        <strong>Watch the documentary Who Took Johnny if you're following this theory</strong>
        <p><p>The movie is about Johnny Gosch, a paper boy who was abducted in 1982 in Iowa and still hasn't been found, despite the mother's and community's efforts. The movie is well structured and shows how a lot of high-ranking individuals in certain circles are associated the pedophile rings and how law enforcement (local, state, and federal) refuse to cooperate in investigating. I saw a lot of similarities to everything going on with Comet Pizza and those associated with Alefantis. Even the hidden basement part of the ranch where they kept kids in Nebraska is similar to the pictures shown through the instagram.<br>
Link to the movie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH2S440aev0 also on netflix<br>
Here are some links to the basement and hole theories:<br>

Apparently, "chicken lover" is a euphemism for homosexual pedophilia.<br>
I've been going deep into the rabbit hole and there are a lot of other good posts in the_donald about what's going on with Comet Pizza and Pizzagate. Here's one for reference   https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bpa7c/breaking_from_the_anon_who_brought_you_the_laura/, credit to u/PleadingtheYiff</p></p>
