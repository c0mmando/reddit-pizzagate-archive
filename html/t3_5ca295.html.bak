        <strong>Pizzagate Investigators: This Is What We Should Look At Next</strong>
        <p><p>Moving quickly with this investigation is especially important as the culprits know we're onto them and are currently trying to cover their tracks. As you know Besta Pizza has already changed its logo. https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5c8i96/besta_pizza_changed_their_logo/</p>
<p>These are the avenues/leads that need to be further looked into. Please post other suggestions, to be used as inspiration by investigators having reached a dead-end.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Corporate logos: we can use Google Images to look at random logos of pizza places and find other ones possibly involved in CP. There must be plenty, in all cities and countries. Google for example "pizza restaurant logo xxx" where xxx is any city. We know what the symbolism is. https://wikileaks.org/wiki/FBI_pedophile_symbols. Do this for your city right now, let us know if you find anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Figure out the full purpose of the pizzeria: other than tongue-in-cheek "because cheese pizza means child porn" or because pizza delivery is a good way to distribute child porn, or because of the parties / victim identification. Is there another purpose? Money laundering for example? Child trafficking is an expensive/lucrative activity, all that money has to be accounted somewhere. We need to find (and follow) the money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other business entities: if pizzerias are used to launder CP money, other types of business that involve a lot of cash could be too: casinos, laundromats, motels, etc. need to be looked at too for clues of CP (typically in the logos/marketing). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These people like to brag, to leave little easter eggs in interviews they do. Look at this example: https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2004/apr/20/usa.world Tony Podesta admits in 2004 to have built "a huge subterranean vault beneath their house outside Washington [...] in which it will be possible to show very complicated video pieces on all four walls". There's another one where Podesta years ago said he's dreaming after retirement of a hot dog stand in Hawaii (can't find it anywhere, positive it exists though). Now that we have the Rosetta stone, and understand their code, we need to look at all past interviews by suspects ever mentioning pizza parties, pasta, hot dogs, dominos, walnut sauce, etc. to find new clues/culprits. Similarly we need to look back at all past leaks with that same filter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We know they probably use ebay to sell/acquire CP masquerading as faulty hard drives (at unrealistic prices and with stellar reviews). https://sli.mg/a/hhe7CP Are there other such sellers on ebay that can be tied to our usual suspects?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If for whatever reason you have access to relevant telephone records, business filings, banking information, police records, server/traffic logs, cctv footage, and you can do so safely, you need to leak them now. You know who the suspects are. Please do humanity a favor. (For example, if you are a network admin at Jimdo or Amazon you probably (can) have access to current and/or archived cometpingpong.com http or traffic log (notably to their /protected/ folder - the ssl certificate is invalid so most accesses probably happen in clear text over http)).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aside from the above, where else should we look?</strong></p></p>

        <p><p>I have a hunch that people are being shadowbanned at a site wide admin level or something. They aren't being told about it and just continue posting. It's possible that other users who are shadowbanned can see the topics but no one else can. Lots of weird shit with even cross posting a topic they made. </p>
<p>Just keep all of that in mind </p></p>

        <p><p>Pointed out in another post there are several "big cheese LLC" businesses owned by really odd people, with no business front usually, and most of the time if linked to something it is very family friendly or blatantly child centered. It is not just limited to pizza. There was one place that was a child foster home essentially.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not sure about the Hawaii connection. Obama has mentioned selling T-shirts in Hawaii after he is done in office. This may be more noise than signal. I think right now we should focus on: http://www.cometpingpong.com/protected/. WHAT KIND OF A PIZZA PLACE HAS A PASSWORD PROTECTED SECTION ON THEIR WEBSITE?!?!</p>
