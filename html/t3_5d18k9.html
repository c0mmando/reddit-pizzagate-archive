        <strong>The Meaning of Fish Symbol on Podesta's Hand</strong>
        <p><p>http://imgur.com/a/OUVXE</p>
<p>On Kiwi Farms we were looking at the Podesta E-mails, a user there claims that the Fish symbol is used in pedophile communities in the deep web. They said that they did research on pedophilia and child trafficking when they were in college and that's how they learned this. Thought it might be worthwhile to share. </p></p>
