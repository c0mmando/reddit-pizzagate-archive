        <p><p>Nice find!! I've heard them use the dominos innuendo before in a different email. That doesn't have anything to do with food. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>P.S. Do you think I'll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IMO, this is 100% definitive proof they are speaking in code. </p></p>

        <p><p>No it's not proof. Certainly suspicious. Search for other references to dominos and Podestas rules. JP makes up rules as he plays is the inside joke. Also see the early full chan threads where they debunk some of the food stuff </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, I'm pretty sure this specific instance is code, and I definitely believe most of the stuff being uncovered here. That said, it <em>could</em> be something along the lines of:</p>
<p>Last year, when Podesta got this guy, Herb, artisanal dried pasta for Christmas (like many Christmases prior), their families got together and enjoyed the gift for dinner. After dinner, Podesta and Herb and whoever else retired to the parlor for a game of dominoes. Podesta kicked Herb's ass in dominoes, and Herb jokingly blamed it on being sleepy/woozy/out of it from the gigantic, filling pasta meal. This year, with the change in gift to a lighter cheese sampler thing, Herb recalls back to the old inside joke and jokingly speculates that the cheese sampler won't affect his game skills as negatively as the pasta did.</p>
<p>That said, the Podestas' art collections, the Connecticut Ave. pedo-symbol businesses that are all related to one another + the Clinton/Podesta/Brock gang, and the ton of other "coincidences" have me convinced that, overall, this is real.</p></p>

        <p><p>Like, "I sleep better on pasta?"</p>
<p>Literally never heard such a thing. And it still makes far more sense if it's drugs, since food doesn't affect your domino playing abilities.</p></p>

        <p><p>Then that is Herb from the Sandler Foundation. Lots of emails back and forth between Sandler and Podesta, including a consultant's agreement, although I don't remember who was paying who and for what.</p>
<p>In one email, there was a .docx attachment with a "Soros Plan" very much like the run of the mill Alinsky stuff. Basically Commandeer, Cause Chaos, Don't Stop, Rinse and Repeat, blah blah blah. Wish I would have saved the link.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that there are campaign ties and Clinton Foundation deep ties to Sandler group. And another one to look into is Annenberg Foundation. Two days after all of that spririt cooking stuff broke, people here were trying to follow the Marina Abramović money trail because they had made a verifiable connection linking Marina to Hillary's State Dept. While following the money, Annenberg came up.</p>
<p>With all of these foundations, it's very possible that we have one giant money circle jerk going on, and my guess is that there are a bunch of them involved.</p></p>

<ul>
<li>Dominos = Domination</li>
<li>Cheese = child girl</li>

        <p><p>He has gotten a gift from a woman. Her gifts are usually some kind of pasta gift pack, but this time it was cheese. He and his grandchildren will go crazy on that cheese later. He then adds a little silly PS wondering if he'll perform better on dominoes night this time. </p>
<p>And it could of course be code for something and I guess it's good that people are on the case. </p>
<p>Point being, this isn't damning evidence of any kind. Paired up with with evidence of a crime being committed fitting to what this could be code for maybe, but this mail on its own tells us nothing. </p>
<p>It makes no sense going crazy on everyone we find talking about pasta and cheese. </p></p>

        <p><p>This has been linked or mentioned several times, and I have yet to see one rational explanation for this.  Seriously, I thought the "handkerchief with Pizza related map" was creepy, but even then people tried to justify with handkerchiefs adorned with italian restaurants.  For this, there is not one possible explanation I can see if not speaking in code</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't think it is bad to redraw attention to this.  Lots and lots of info here, I think it is good to keep drawing attention to the parts that are especially glaring.  For me the biggest ones in the email are "handkerchief with pizza related map", this one, and the one where you can spend time with the kids "raw and uncut"</p></p>

        <p><p>Its basically being deleted as its being found. I've been following this for weeks and especially this sub closely for the past week, its amazing the back and forth struggle between the two sides. You're one of many many people including myself, who are discovering 'NEW' information only to discover it had been found out before. Whats interesting to me is the AMOUNT OF TIMES this is happening. I've never seen websites get taken down, things deleted, replaced, 404'd, ddos attacked, so much. you name it its happened to EVERYTHING surrounding this in the past few weeks.</p></p>

        <p><p>Ok this is a rabbit hole I also stumbled across. I googled dominoes and satanic ritual and came across this link of a book:http://maryafischer.com/mcmartin-a-case-of-dominoes/ when researching the McMartin case it involves pedophilia and satanic ritual abuse, it was the most expensive and longest criminal trial in history (at least at that time, in the 80s). There was a CIA/FBI guy that allegedly covered it up http://www.stewwebb.com/2014/02/08/mcmartin-preschool-pedophilia-case-mother-targeted-by-fbi-ted-gunderson/
Along with Hollywood and media's help https://ritualabuse.us/ritualabuse/articles/mcmartin-preschool-case-what-really-happened-and-the-coverup/ Many witnesses and the first parent to bring accusations were suspiciously dead/suicided. Crazy shit. There were even tunnels underground that weren't found until the parents went out and dug! https://www.google.com/amp/s/kassandraproject.wordpress.com/2008/04/04/satanic-ritual-child-sex-abuse-the-mcmartin-case-revisited/amp/ anyway it was also part of a broader "hysteria" at the time. Tons of preschool and daycares were implicated. 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-care_sex-abuse_hysteria</p>
<p>Edit: I'm no autist, but I think this needs attention
*Edit 2: Ted Gunderson the FBI agent that investigated eventually blew the whistle on the satanic ritual abuse, child trafficking, pedophilia, government involvement, even a slave auction in vegas,... wow. Then he died of "kidney failure" some say arsenic poisoning. All this happened during Bush Sr, (who was CIA director before being president) Gunderson says he was involved too. Edit 3: Gunderson had boxes full of evidence on the Finders (a CIA operation to kidnap the children!) and the Franklin cover up https://geopolitics.co/2015/01/17/ted-gunderson-fbi-whistleblower-vs-satanists/</p></p>

        <p><p>I got the same result, sorry I should have said that. It's what got me researching the McMartin case though. Some people on here think it was a hoax/false memories but there are so many strange circumstances. Many people involved with the case died/committed suicide. It seems like the media downplayed everything and laughed off some of the more outrageous claims, like tunnels.  Years later though, an entire study was done by a ucla archeaologist and they did find tunnels, right where the kids said. Idk still researching it...</p></p>

        <p><p>I personally think this email is nothing. This person obviously receives Pasta Sauces from Podesta and was surprised to be sent cheese this time. He says "Do you think i'll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta" because he's making a joke about Podestas food being so good its almost like a drug.   </p></p>

        <p><p>"On cheese" or "on pasta" as in "on weed," or "on alcohol," or "on McDonald's" or "on a stomach full of mashed potatoes."  Used that sort of lingo plenty of times.  They're talking about their domino-playing ability, and if it would be better after eating cheese or pasta.  I've talked about my baseball/softball ability after various meals in such a manner plenty of times.  I'm assuming they lost badly after a pasta dinner the last time they played.</p></p>

<p>It wouldn't literally, it's just a joke.  Like I said earlier, I've joked like plenty of times like that, as have many people throughout my life.  It doesn't make any sense, because that's the joke.</p>

<p>How ironic.  It's such a leap to use anything in this email as evidence or clues for any sort of child trafficking or whatever ring.  Plenty of other stuff I've seen is way more damning than this email.  I just think this one is quite innocuous.</p></p>

        <p><p>yeah you didn't have to take #1 super seriously ya dweeb</p>
<p>and that 'joke' doesn't mean anything unless it's code. there's nothing inherently funny about 'do you think playing dominos would be better after eating cheese or pizza?' that's not a joke unless dominos means something. </p>
<p>is this funny to you: 'do you think i'd be better at  basketball after eating cherries or apple pie'? no, that's not a joke. that's just gibberish. i referenced occams razor because it's an easier explanation that these men are speaking in code than talking absolute gibberish</p></p>

        <p><p>If I had some cherry pie, went out to play with my regular group, and threw up bricks all day, I might wonder about the difference and make a joke like that.  Acting like I was "under the influence" of cherry pie vs any other.</p>
<p>I remember back in my Halo 3 days, when I kept going negative during a night of Ranked Squad Battle after eating roast that night.  The next night I had some chicken strips, did better, and joked that I played better on chicken vs beef.  I happen to specifically remember this because that was the first time my wife at the time had made chicken strips, and they were damn good.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's seems awkward to you, because you are peeking into the life and conversations of total strangers (to you), who have a history with each other. People who probably know each other for years (close family in some cases) and who made countless of jokes and remarks over the years. A lot of this "weird" stuff in the emails just looks like references to older conversations to me.</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree with you on this. I have definitely heard "on" being used to reference a recent meal in regular conversation. It seems a little unusual that they would make such a big deal out of a game of dominoes, but maybe it was a hilariously remarkable game. I've got plenty of random inside jokes with my friends that nobody else would understand. </p>
<p>While there are definitely emails with strong evidence that Podesta is a pedo, this is one of the weaker ones.</p></p>

        <p><p>Playing dominoes is "domination play" . This was covered Nov 4th. Others refer to "playing dominoes" in the "Podesta method". What he's asking is, "Would I do better whipping, tying up, and beating the shit out of a little girl or a little boy?" </p>
<p>These are literally demons we are dealing with. </p></p>
