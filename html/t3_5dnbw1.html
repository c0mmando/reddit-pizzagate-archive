        <strong>bait and switch</strong>
        <p><p>I have a plan to prove that government agencies are try to censor pizzagate and come after who's trying to expose it. It involves an email and a federal subpoena for that email accounts information. That's all I will say here. I will post any requests that the email service receives once it's done. If nothing comes of it then obviously they didn't fall for it. </p></p>
