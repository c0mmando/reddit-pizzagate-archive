        <strong>Adressing the absence of media coverage</strong>
        <p><p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>As a Frenchman, I've been abashed by the utter lack of media coverage of the pizzagate, both in my country and in general. The digging work of this sub has been nothing short of tremendous, but now we have the material to take a step forward.</p>
<p>Therefore, I plan to contact as many journalists as possible about this.
What can I use to uphold my case and summerize it to people who are going to be tempted to see me as a conspiratard? I need to gather the most solid evidence.</p>
<p>What is crucial is that only the strong evidence is going to be able to convince people. So I'm left wondering how to present the solid links that have been uncovered without looking like I'm grasping at straws. The weaker pieces of evidence can then serve to complement the framework of the pizzagate. </p>
<p>For instance, if I started with the symbology, nobody would believe it. However, the other way around, symbology could shed some light and add some depth to the case.</p>
<p>Can aynone help me on this?</p></p>

        <p><p>We need a package to send to journalist.
There is a huge amount of information and it's very difficult to believe unless you spend several hours checking all the leads.
So I agree we need to create an introduction page with text and pictures stating the most blatant "coincidences". </p>
<p>Anyone with good level skills?</p></p>

        <p><p>There are three reasons.</p>
<p>1) While EXTREMELY suspicious, no one has found a smoking gun that proves beyond a reasonable doubt. Sure we've what looks like a code that matches deep web pedophilia nomenclacture, some encrypted and stonography files no one has cracked and if they do crack could run the risk of going to jail for CP (given who is implimented in power) rather than thanked for reporting evidence, some suspicious building, some suppicous magicly dropped child kidnapping cases and those cases dropping with Clinton Foundation help.... But it doesn't prove BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. Until DNA is found on a kid, a picture or video is found, or pics of transporting kids or remains, it won't be enough to accuse. everything is alledged so far. </p>
<p>2) Media is buddy buddy with podesta, and people in high levels of power are implicated too. There is a huge chance of embarssment if it's learned they not only knew about podesta's alleged pedophilia, but may of been involved. Remember, nothing has been proven beyond a reasonble doubt and everything now is speculation and suspicion.</p>
<p>3) Timing. Keep in mind all that was closed on the FBI case was the original case saying nothing new according to that was found. There are 2 other investigations going after Clinton. NYPD and FBI investigating the Clinton foundation for a child sex ring, and IRS investigating the Clinton Foundations money laundering. If found guild and recomending now we know loretta lynch will cover for hillary or refuse to prosecute (she did already when pleaing the 5th). Trump may not be so leanient.</p></p>

        <p><p>http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/11/04/erik-prince-nypd-ready-make-arrests-weiner-case/  If this is accurate my gut feeling is FBI gagged the nypd and will just persue the 'normal' crimes and bury everything else as they probably have ties.  Just a feeling</p></p>

        <p><p>Someone needs to continue summarising everything in a package, I agree. There is SO MUCH here. It's very hard to get stuck into this unless you've been on it for many many hours.</p></p>

        <p><p>Check 8 chan also they have some good archives.  Everything on 4chan got nuked.</p>
<p>My opinion- don't go balls deep with the occult symbolism shit it makes people think it's bullshit just go for the obvious pedo references, like the fact that there's a clit on the awning of comet pizza.  </p></p>

        <p><p>I would argue to not send any information to journalists until all research has been exhausted and archived. We need as much information as possible. Going to the journalists is akin to alerting the culprits and them being able to cover their tracks.I would say once all research is completed, then we can start sending out info to journalists.</p>
<p>Most journalists are NOT who we think they are. They are bought and paid for by the people we are trying to expose. </p></p>

        <p><p>Try starting with alternative media. One of the more "reputable" ones (please not Alex Jones). If enough of them cover it, next comes something at least borderline mainstream.</p></p>

        <p><p>Smaller newspapers might be a good bet. Washington Times was the only paper that covered the Franklin Scandal. Big newspapers are more cautious and probably bought off. But local papers have less to lose and might want the extra attention. </p></p>
