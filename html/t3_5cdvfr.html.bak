        <strong>Message the mods over at r/the_donald to white list this subreddit in their auto moderator.</strong>
        <p><p>This sub is so new it hasn't been added and we cant link to you from r/the_donald.</p>
<p>Admins forced us to use a whitelist for linking because somebody could try to encourage brigadier from us, it was a failed plot to ban our domreddit but we are still operating under such scrutiny.</p>
<p>The automoderator declares it the "trumpire" so you may want to use that term in your message to the mods.</p></p>

        <p><p>Don't hold your breath on that one.  When this first broke 4 or so days ago, there was a thread already there discussing this, well on its way to getting to their first page:</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bk3t6/what_the_fucking_fuck_is_someone_playing_a/</p>
<p>And then, the moderators deleted it.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bko5i/not_a_drill_reddit_censored_this_thread_on_our/">I then made a thread</a> saying someone is actively censoring on our subreddit, which got 18 upvotes in 30 seconds, before being deleted and me being permabanned for "being a new account, suspected troll."  I asked the mod team for more information on why I got banned, and I got told by /u/Trumpropriation "We removed it because its stupid" and then muted me from communicating further.  I spoke with at least half a dozen other redditors, and they too have got banned just from bringing it up.</p>
<p>I'm convinced /r/the_donald is infiltrated.  They allow the trolling, shitposting, and some conspiracies, but remove anything that is too damning.  Do you really think it would be too hard to have one really legit looking account to get accepted into their mod team?  There is a genuine concern amongst people in finding this information.  Why are the moderators not allowing this to reach the first page?  Isn't this relevant to the subreddit?  I'd love to hear an explanation from said moderator who banned me.</p></p>

        <p><p>What was happening 4 days ago? Why would we want to steer the message of the board toward getting Trump elected and away from an unproven idea that is not directly pointed toward electing Trump?</p></p>

        <p><p>If that was the case, why was myself and numerous others banned without so much as a warning?  Why was the original post upvoted to oblivion in a short time, if the viewer base didn't see it as relevant?</p>
<p>There was no sticky, no warning.  If what you said to me right now via a PM then, at least I could appreciate and respect that decision.  Do you see why your action could be seen as concerning as best, and subversion of the subreddit at worse?  I'd appreciate it if you apologized and unbanned me.</p></p>

        <p><p>He is a dickbag anyways.  He banned me because I asked a legitimate question regarding the ACA- it was completely neutral.</p>
<p>Not a single bit of sarcasm, just an actual honest question.  Fucky for a guy supporting a guy who is supposed to believe in the 1st.</p></p>

        <p><p>Quick question do you guys over at T_D have an alternate site or a way to back up threads? Apparently pizzagate discussions are being delete over at /pol/. Seems only a matter of time before this place will suddenly disappear.</p></p>

        <p><p>reddit can't hide posts very effectively, archive and wayback machine both work. I reccomend you use 8chan's /pol/ though they broke from 4chan over censorship like 2 years ago.</p>
<p>That said admins are making the conversation difficult at the donald when it comes to pizzagate they shadow ban and hide posts.</p></p>
