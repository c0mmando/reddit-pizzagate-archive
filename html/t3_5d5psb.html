        <strong>important information is scattered around. Basically this whole sub is disorganised.</strong>
        <p><p>Do you people have any plans/ideas on how to get organised? 
Some of the evidence presented inhere should be made readily available to the general public, available to people that do not understand reddit/4chan etc etc. </p>
<p>Sharing your leads/evidence inhere is good stuff though don't get me wrong. But to get the wheels in motion you people need a huge audience, and that aint gonna happen on reddit.</p>
<p>So, what plans/ideas/suggestions do you have ?</p></p>

        <p><p>I suggested this in another thread</p>
<p>I've been messaging the mods, working on it. My suggestion is TWO Threads, one for confirmed evidence...the main one where people can start at the top and by the end of it be fully caught up.</p>
<p>Two - one where all NEW evidence goes. If something new is discovered it has to be documented and maybe verified by other sources. Once that is done, the new evidence gets posted to the main thread.</p>
<p>Edit maybe a thread for legit COUNTER-Arguments. Whatever fact the person is denying/explaining needs to be posted and then his/her argument.</p></p>

        <p><p>I like this idea. I especially like the counter-arguments one. It shows we are open to listening to other sides and have a discussion. The way I see it, the more we allow for conversation, the more we are heard.</p></p>

        <p><p>Exactly. I also want the counter argument thread for my own sanity. This shit is depressing, i mentioned this before... Post the instagram pics and the emails and explain to me how we are wrong. Please convince me with logic</p></p>

        <p><p>That's comforting haha Dont feel so crazy. I agree thou. Usually im a super level headed person but there is something about this that i cant shake. This is the first time something on the internet has bothered me to the point where my sleep is super restless. I just want answers.</p></p>

        <p><p>Comforting me to, too, lol. I like to consider myself level headed as well and I like to look at things from all angles and be as skeptical as possible...but I agree this just isn't sitting right with me. </p>
<p>I'm still leaving room for these people to be innocent, but that little bit of wiggle room is closing fast. I'm going to be showing this stuff to people I know to get their input and see if they can confirm my reality on all this.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think this is a really good idea. I have been trying to put something together to use to redpill friends and families (informative, extremely well sourced, and formatted for the audience, so trying to lay off things that would make this seem more unbelievable than it already is), it's been turning out to be way more difficult than I anticipated. Disorganized information overload spread out between multiple online communities, shills/disinfo/jumping to conclusions etc, threads being deleted, I don't even know where to start anymore or what's really important to cover. </p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks, I have several other pastebins and summaries saved too. It's just a little overwhelming.I'm trying not to go nuts and overload it with info, but I also think it's important to preface the pizzagate portion with stuff about the general shittiness of our government/society (other pedo rings, unethical human experimentation, proven false flags) because so many people are still under this illusion that they want what's best for us or this is too crazy to believe.I mean it's still hard for me to wrap my mind around all this shit and I've been interested in "conspiracy theories" for a long time. I'm probably just overthinking it I don't know this stuff has been fucking with my head I think. </p></p>

        <p><p>Keep digging until there is actionable intelligence.  The easiest way to get people to understand is simply exposing them to the weird shit and comments on the social media accounts we have uncovered.  That is the only real proof of anything.  Everything else is speculation.  This is all new, and disjointed, but I believe there is enough people actually contributing to eventually get somewhere.  We as a community need to squash out the false dichotomies being created (right vs left), (god vs satan) etc.  This is good vs evil.  We are trying to prevent harm to children, not stop a "globalist" agenda, or connect this abuse to every conspiracy that has ever been proposed.  We as a community need to come off as intelligent, well-reasoned, and united in our cause to protect children from the abuse we suspect is occurring.  If one kid is spared abuse it was worth the effort.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is a real problem. I think there is something real here, but also a lot of false leads, and some total BS, some of it just innocent and some of it maybe planted by shills.
I think we need people to:
1) Maintain a list of all "investigation" sites: reddit/4chan/8chan/whatever
2) Engage in discussion of evidence: pros and cons
3) Save screenshots, etc to local devices
4) Save screenshots, etc to multiple archive sites
5) Post references to pizzagate, with links, all over in twitter/forums/irc/street-posters/graffiti
6) Keep continually updated summaries of different facets of the inquiry</p>
<p>The last part might be most important. I think a lot of good stuff is getting  lost, because no one is linking it to related stuff.  It is just getting posted and then it disappears as people post other stuff. </p></p>
