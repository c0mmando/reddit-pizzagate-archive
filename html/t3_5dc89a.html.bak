        <p><p>He's just an extremely famous sculptor, with a minimalist style.  It seems the look of the refrigeration room was being compared to one of his sculptures.  For example http://blog.art21.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Zwirner_Judd_install-5-1.jpg</p>
<p>He's also been dead for more than 20 years.</p></p>
