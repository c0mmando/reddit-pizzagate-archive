        <strong>A chilling video with sexual torture, infants, pizza with a child's head on top, that "Amanda Kleinman" (Comet Ping Pong) conveniently didn't tell us about!!</strong>
        <p><p>Someone just discovered a previously unseen Amanda Kleinman video, it looks to be an older project s/he was involved with called "Apes."</p>
<p>(If you are unfamiliar with who Amanda Kleinman is, s/he performs at Comet Ping Pong Pizza. When people discovered the pedophilia themes, Kleinman accused everybody of being a "right wing conspiracy theorist." Here is the background: https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dar01/reply_to_amanda_kleinman_empirically_verifiable/)</p>
<p>Warning, what you are about to see is bizarre and contains flashing images of children, pedophilia references and torture among other disturbing themes. </p>
<p>And of course there are the out-of-place pizza references which we have come to expect from these people. There is a photo of a child next to Chucky "Cheese", and two images of a slice of pizza with the head of an infant on the crust. </p>
<p>There is a photo of a child dressed in a chocolate candy costume, marked "delicious."</p>
<p>There is also a photo of what appears to be a large mouth effigy eating a child, and several photos of torture or bondage, and graphic sexual mutilation. </p>
<p>There are also photos of multiple babies. </p>
<p>There is a photo of strange symbols surrounding the earth. </p>
<p>One illustration shows a dark entity or being carrying what appears to be the corpse of a girl. </p>
<p>ADDENDUM: there are also multiple images of Sathya Sai Baba, a hardcore pedophile. (Here is what he looks like: https://sathyasaibaba.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/puttaparthi-sai-blessings-yellow.jpg) Here is more info on his pedophilia, which was notoriously covered up: http://www.saibaba-x.org.uk/6/saisex6.htm. (Thank you FlygandeSjuk for identifying it.)</p>
<p>The video seems to have many subliminal messages that whiz by faster than the eye can detect.</p>
<p>If you do not want to expose your mind to potentially harmful subliminal suggestions and imagery, you can view frozen screen shots here: http://imgur.com/a/BYjvJ</p>
<p>Another commenter captured more photos that we weren't able to get (warning applies): https://sli.mg/a/6SfUDg</p>
<p>Here is the video in full (you have been warned): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oicUO0sz08c</p>
<p>(Note: several images were not able to be captured, they are heinous. To view them in the actual video, click the gear icon below the YouTube video, set the speed to the slowest at .5, then start the video from the beginning. You will be able to see everything then. And it is nightmarish.)</p>
<p>For whatever reason, Amanda did not tell us about this video when she tried to "debunk" what she calls a "right wing conspiracy theory." It was left out. Convenient.</p>
<p>Really, at this point, whether you have been following along or you are here just to defend these sick people, any thinking human being needs to pause and ask WHY these people seem to be so obsessed with little children, pizza, babies, pedophilia, etc. </p>
<p>It is not creepy, it is not art, it is not edgy, it is simply deformed and shameful, and it needs to be questioned.</p>
<p>Edit to add: the video also refers viewers to the following website: www.theapes.com. It appears to be a no-name band that Amanda used to be part of. One of the photos shows an adult man hunched over a child's area called "Moto kids" with a comment saying "I'm not sure we want to know" what he's doing. </p>
<p>Also on www.theapes.com you will find a section called "Baba's mountain," likely referring back to the the pedophile Sai Baba.  Baba's mountain (i.e. pedophile's mountain) is described as an event where youth are enticed to "come see for yourself." It is accompanied by a photo showing minors gathered in the woods, with two adult figures standing over them dressed in ceremonial garb.</p></p>

You have heard rumors of those gone missing: Adolescents, leaving their homes, wandering into the night and never being seen again. The melting of children into feed for the woodland animals.</p>
<p>Please ignore these rumors - rumors created by your teachers, the local media, parental figures. Ignore the ignorant teens-in-heat "blogs". Spurred by myth, inspired by whispers, many have written us from all over the world, wanting to know more about our mountain retreat. </p>
<p>WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT AMANDA?  Sounds to me like you are kidnapping children. </p></p>

        <p><p>Good find. And the photo they put up with that looks like minors in a forest with two people in ceremonial garb. </p>
<p>Not to say everything must be satanic... but at the very least these people are total nutcases, that's for sure. </p>
<p>I wonder if the event was used to lure vulnerable minors to the location. "Why not come see for yourself?"</p>
<p>WTF</p></p>

        <p><p>From your archive.is link, the random string spells "kek" if you take every other letter. These kind of small synchronicities suggest the universe has a sense of humor... or is giving us signs to keep going. So many such synchronicities happen on 4chan (GETs), must smile..</p></p>

        <p><p>Baba's Mountain could be a reference to Baba Yaga, a character in Slavic folklore, this stood out to me because I remembered some of the story from when I was younger, specifically some old lady in a chicken legged house that has a penchant for eating small children:</p>
<hr>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Yaga</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...Ivan eventually finds the chicken-legged hut of the youngest of the three sisters turning in an open field. This third and youngest of the Baba Yagas makes the same comment about "the Russian smell" before running to whet her teeth and consume Ivan. Ivan begs her to give him three horns and she does so. The first he blows softly, the second louder, and the third louder yet. This causes birds of all sorts to arrive and swarm the hut. One of the birds is the firebird, which tells him to hop on its back or Baba Yaga will eat him...</p>
</blockquote></p>

        <p><p>The Baba they are referring to is Sathya Sai Baba, because the video also includes clear images of him. He is a documented pedophile. (This is him: https://sathyasaibaba.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/puttaparthi-sai-blessings-yellow.jpg)</p>
<p>They are inviting people to "Baba's mountain" (essentially, a pedophile's mountain). No wonder they have an illustration with minors gathered in a forest. It seems to me they are trying to lure kids and entrap them. </p>
<p>I wonder how many minors actually went to the event at "Baba's mountain," and I wonder how many never returned home afterwards. </p></p>

<p>Note: thought Sam was the shit then but he's in way over his head when he talks politics. </p></p>

<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Grove</p>
<p>There's a lot of videos of people "openly" talking about it. Nixon described it as the "most faggy god dammed thing you could ever imagine".</p>
<p>Alex Jones infiltrated the place in 2000 and filmed the bizarre ceremony that takes place. The video can easily be found on Youtube and is very odd.</p>

        <p><p>I watched the video earlier and thought nothing of it, the images go by too quickly.   Seeing the still images -- I'm horrified.   This is not edgy art.   This is yet more <em>nudge nudge wink wink</em> advertising for pedophilia and worse.   Yet again it involves pizza.   I don't see how the shills can keep pretending that there is nothing to see here.   We're not talking about one or two or ten "coincidences."   The same themes are recurring over and over again.   </p></p>

        <p><p>tardbuster, I'm tired of seeing your fucking inept attempts to discredit the facts and claiming there's "nothing to see here", subsequently supporting the pedophilic imagery that is used to make these websites and videos. As mentioned several times, you are obviously a band member or possibly Amanda herself. Regardless, the more you try to discredit the evidence by "sticking to the script" i.e. "OH IT'S JUST ART YOU GUYS", the more you are looking guilty. This kind of sick shit is NOT ACCEPTABLE. Involving children in your disgusting idea of art is not acceptable. </p>
<p><strong>(Who the fuck keeps a golden-statue of a serial-killer victim's death-pose in their fucking foyer and paintings of tied up kids on their walls? Seriously, bro... )</strong></p>
<p><strong>Art collectors, that's who.</strong></p>
<p>Bitch. <strong>Pedophilic</strong> art collectors do. NOT JUST REGULAR ART COLLECTORS. You're missing a big point in your lousy attempts to support pedophilic allusions and imagery. You can keep on trying to defend yourself and your friends, but we all see right through you.</p></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Does he? People link to Djurdjevic's Paradise Lost and say "this is Podesta's favorite artist" but nowhere have I seen that Podesta has that hanging on his wall. </p>
<p>Here is one he does own: <a href="http://imgur.com/XZk9guf">"Synchronized Swimming"</a>, exhibited <a href="http://www.acfny.org/category/exhibitions/serbia-catalogue/biljana-djurdjevic/">here</a> on loan from the Podestas, with a catalog note that says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Biljana Djurdjević’s paintings reference the iconography and structural role of traditional painting, as well as the imagery of contemporary popular culture. Within these frameworks she scrutinizes relations of power and violence, the perplexities of growing up in a patriarchal social order, and the anxieties of adolescent sexuality. In keeping with the aesthetics of her other work, Synchronized Swimming is characterized by emotional intensity. The tension created between the eight female figures (possibly representative of the eight states of former Yugoslavia) and the barren environment in which they are placed produce an unsettling experience for the viewer.</p>

        <p><p>This article ( http://tracytwyman.com/dahmer-pose-statue-in-tony-podestas-house-matches-illustration-from-aleister-crowley-text/ )demonstrates that the Arch of Hysteria is indeed based on Jeffrey Dahmer's victim (the statue is decapitated and placed exactly like him), and that Jeffrey Dahmer's victim may have naturally taken this pose, known as opisthotonos, due to having muriatic acid poured onto his brain through a hole cut in his skull. Opisthotonos is also caused other types of damage to the nervous system, such as meningitis, and by hysteria, which is why she called it that. </p>
<p>Then in this article ( http://tracytwyman.com/jeffrey-dahmer-aleister-crowley-exorcist-iii-911-and-pizzagate/ ), it talks about how Dahmer's favorite film was The Exorcist III, which features an image of a man in a similar position. It also talks about other synchronicities between this film, which takes place in Washington, D.C., and other aspects of Pizzagate.</p></p>

<p>So when galleries exhibit those works, are they "pedophilic galleries"?</p>
<p>By the way I must be missing something, what does a statue of an ADULT victim of a serial killer victim have to do with pedophilia? Beyond just being more evidence that you guys seem to equate anything YOU find distasteful with pedophilia, I mean.</p></p>

        <p><p>Precisely. If there is an art gallery theming itself around these kinds of works, then it can rightfully be considered a pedophilic gallery. The difference is in the context.</p>
<p>The ADULT VICTIM was one of many victims murdered - several of those victims being CHILDREN who were abused, tortured, raped, and killed by the same guy who this statue is relevant to. We are looking at the CONTEXT of everything. Sorry, I didn't mean to LITERALLY imply that a statue of an adult victim is pedophilic. (You are simply trying make arguments by taking things out of context, as obvious in all of your comments). When I wrote that, I had a specific person in mind I was thinking about who owns this statue and displays it among a multitude of child-related torture and pedophilic themes. CONTEXT, Amanda. Context.</p></p>

        <p><p>Pretty simple, it's a goofy Christmas-themed video to promote their album. The band thought putting a bunch of horrible images flashing in the beginning was funny. They are just random google image search images. Or do you think the goofy skier is some kind of deep pedo symbology?</p>
<p>Baba in Baba's Mountain does refer to Baba Yaga.</p>
<p>What's funny is that while you guys are dumb, "not getting it" isn't because you're "not smart enough". There's nothing to "get" -- it's just a band putting together goofy videos. It was explained on their facebook page, it harks back to growing up in the 70s when people would find rock bands so mysterious and dangerous and maybe even evil. </p>
<p>At worst we're talking about bad taste here. In almost 20 years of the Apes and Heavy Breathing, you guys, starting a week or two ago, are LITERALLY the only ones who have ever stated any negative reaction to the aesthetics or jokes of these bands. No one else seems to have any problem recognizing that it's just a goof.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't know of a known pedophile and I don't know if they do either. Like I said, the flashing images are the result of google image search for horrible/weird/funny images. Yes, random. </p>
<p>It should be obvious to you guys that the vast majority of people aren't as familiar with pedophiles and pedophiliac symbology as you all seem to be, so their logos and images are probably not as deliberate as you imagine they are. Besta Pizza comes to mind. I can 100% guarantee you those poor guys had absolutely no fucking idea why people were suddenly harassing them and giving them bad reviews.</p>
<p>edit: Just looked up this Baba guy and he is known primarily as a guru, his wiki mentions that one guy accused him of sexual abuse.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not sure what picture you're referring to of grown men with dolls on their lap. In any case I don't think a weird pic is "blatantly promoting pedophilia". The video is a woman talking to little kids about someone else, an adult hipster, jerking off to the ads of a hipster clothing store.</p>
<p>It's fine that you don't like what you see and don't get many of the references, but that doesn't mean it makes sense for you to throw around accusations of "blatantly promoting pedophilia".</p></p>

        <p><p>The facts are: Several businesses near Comet Pizza, and including Comet Pizza, have ties to many known pedophiles. Couple that with the pedo-logo on Besta Pizza'a store front, Terasol's known pedophile logos on their web-page, and Beyond Borders ties to Jeff Koons and Hillary Clinton and Haitian refugees right across the street. "Jimmy Comet's" Instagram is littered with extremely creepy posts, alluding to pedophilia and murder. The Clinton camp seems fond of this area. And ironically, they also have ties to child-trafficking in Haiti, as well as other nations. Bill and Hillary both have visited Jeffrey Epstein's Pedo-island. The Podesta's are CLEARLY into some very creepy sadistic, possibly satanic, possibly criminal, occult ritual shit. (Who the fuck keeps a golden-statue of a serial-killer victim's death-pose in their fucking foyer and paintings of tied up kids on their walls? Seriously, bro... ) And, remember it was simple references to pizza in WikiLeaks emails that led us to this. And surprise, surprise, do these folks sure like posting pictures and videos, strangely, sexualizing slices of pizza, while also alluding to children as pizza. Particularly, your girlfriend Amanda... I could go on and on. The writing is on the wall. It's over.</p></p>

That video suggests talking to little kids about masturbation, doesn't matter who's doing it.</p></p>

        <p><p>yeah i have, and you can make humorous pedophile jokes. Lets investigate </p>
<p>A funny pedo joke: "something something jared's getting free footlongs for life"</p>
<p><em>edit</em>
Amanda's pedo joke "something something Jared likes little boys but we all have our preferences" </p>
<p>See mine was a rape and pedo joke (dark right?), but it was still funny because its about a pedo being raped in prison, and had a subway reference whereas her joke's punchline was "we all have our preferences" which certainly comes off as defending/normalizing pedophilia to me. How do you interpret it?</p>
<p>source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlhBn_zSIro (Amanda making joke referenced above, and just having an overall very off putting vibe.)</p></p>

        <p><p>Dude, I'm sorry but that is total fucking bullshit. I have a very dark sense of humor and this shit isn't funny. I grew up in the LA queer scene as a child (which my mother was apart of) and have been heavily influenced by that culture. I've been to countless pretentious art galleries that use violence and sexually explicit content to try and elicit reactions from viewers. What we are seeing here with Kleinman or Podesta is not the same. It is not the "hip," "edgy," "controversial," "artsy," "sexually provocative," crap I grew up around. </p></p>

        <p><p>What fucking pedophilia?? The video is just a bunch of fucking random images! Has this entire goddamned sub found even one instance of actual child abuse in any of this shit? All I've seen has been "oh there's hearts and spirals in the logos!" and "oh this site has weird stories on it involving children!!", and also lizard people and monarch programming for some fucking reason. If there's no actual child abuse actually fucking happening, it's not pedophilia. Full stop. You fucking moron.</p></p>

        <p><p>Maybe you should save the image and plug it into image search and find the source, and then report back as to how creepy the original source was and how many accusations of pedophilia the original source got. Who knows, maybe the original source is part of this whole pedo ring!</p>
<p>Again my point is that before this ridiculous conspiracy theory, not one person on the face of the earth would have said a kid in a pizza costume is "creepy". Don't project your paranoia on everybody else.</p></p>

        <p><p>You pedophilia supporting fucking moron. There's a difference between saying a kid in a pizza costume is creepy, and saying a kid in a pizza costume that is displayed in a video made by individuals who have a pattern of using pedophilic allusions and imagery, who use pizza and children as a theme... and including that image in an entire video that has references to sex, children, and other deviant sickening material is creepy. Shut the fuck up.</p></p>

        <p><p>So lets say this is all just art and theyre some edgy indie band that goes for shock value.  Thats plausible.</p>
<p>However, when rumors were circling about Marilyn Manson in the 90s he didnt come out angrily and call it all a right-wing conspiracy.  He let people think what they wanted and let the controversy sell albums.</p></p>

        <p><p>Let's get the timeline straight: Amanda started getting horrible messages on her Youtube and Facebook from people calling her a jew bitch and they're going to kill her etc. Completely baffled, she did some googling and found out this originated with 4chan's and Reddit's Donald Trump sub-forums, and their ridiculous conspiracies about the Clintons etc. So yeah, whether or not others have since piled on, the ORIGIN of her harassment is 100% a right-wing conspiracy theory.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not on any wing either, I haven't even heard their music (I'm sure it's terrible) but I'd say that censoring imagery from someone just because some people find it unsavory sounds a lot like censorship to me.<br>
If there is any proof of anything it's fair to have them prosecuted in a court of law, internet harassment is just the tool of the coward and the ignorant.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah...these people are only making it worse :/ </p>
<p>Her 'art' is shitty, but I doubt she herself is a pedo. I feel bad for her if she is just getting caught up in the fire and she is simply kindling to attract the flame. </p>
<p>I think everyone in this sub should watch the movie "The Hunt" with Mads Mikkelsen about a guy wrongly accused of pedophilia and how it destroys his life.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's too late to say it was just a goof. Amanda has clearly been celebrating pedophilia for her entire career. Maybe in her mind it's edgy, but it's a subject that cannot be taken lightly. I have no sympathy. You cannot make art from horror and not expect backlash. The problem is not this backlash, but that Amanda has only ever been in a very controlled atmosphere peddling her "art". </p>
<p>Now that it's getting bad attention because a wider audience sees the depravity first hand, she calls foul? Bullshit. Any true artist knows there is no such thing as bad publicity. The only reason to stop celebrating her sick art and cry foul is because there's truth to it. She is afraid and she fucking should be.</p></p>

        <p><p>Bottom line is this. If you surround yourself with pedophilic imagery, symbolism, then you deserve everything that comes your way. Even if this is nothing more than "art" in her mind, I do not sympathize for her in any way. If you use suggestive art that could imply you're a pedophile and can be llinked to other people/businesses who claim the same; don't be surprised when people start to believe you may actually be a pedophile. These people have nobody to blame but themselves; there is nothing "artsy" about images suggestive of child rape. If this is just art to these idiots they're still monsters. </p></p>

        <p><p>Bottom line is this, you are <em>imagining</em> that she they are surrounding themselves with pedophilic imagery. You see a picture of a kid in a pizza costume and your first instinct is "pedophilia". I can guarantee you that 99.99999% of the population, including the Apes, would not and did not see anything remotely "pedophilic" about that picture.</p>
<p>Please give me a specific example of an image "suggestive of child rape" that you found on the Apes or Heavy Breathing websites.</p></p>

        <p><p>What on earth makes you think that is a child? That looks like a still from one of those Japanese horror/torture movies. Again, projection: I don't believe any reasonable person who didn't go in looking for children would look at that image and think "that's a child". </p></p>

<p>If Ms. Kleinman is indeed innocent of child trafficking, she deserves the flak she is getting for producing this sort of 'art'.  It's about time people stood up and spoke out against this 'tongue in cheek' celebration of subversive taboos.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Again, just to be clear, before this Pizzagate nonsense,  no one -- and I mean no one -- has ever professed to being "shocked" at anything Apes or Heavy Breathing have done. Some of those videos had a few thousand views before you all came along with no angry/revolted comments. I guess the whole world are secret pedos except you guys.</p></p>

        <p><p>Apes played 500+ shows in the U.S. and Europe, put out several records, had thousands of views on some of their videos, had hundreds of write-ups in magazines, newspapers, and on Pitchfork and other music sites. All of those sources saw their art and website, along with the thousands of people they played in front of.</p>
<p>NONE expressed any outrage or disgust. I guess almost everyone in the world outside your basement is a pedo?</p></p>

        <p><p>Stupid and naive? For not believe your bullshit theories? You people do not even have a margin of error. Every link you retards make is accurate and totally makes sense.</p>
<p>This is why full democracy is a ridiculous concept. Voting should be a merit, not a human right. Too many idiots who inhabit this Earth have their minds twisted by this kind of garbage and affect the future of other people who don't. It's shocking that the world is actually able to function like this. I am surprised the world hasn't ended yet.</p></p>

        <p><p>Believe it or not, the idea that tens of thousands of pedos are a part of this parallel society does not shock most of the people here. Instead, your openness about such depravity does. Didn't your lawyer tell you to keep your mouth shut?</p></p>

        <p><p>Amanda is an 'artist and musician' who has events at Comet Ping Pong (suspected for child trafficking). She has this 'alternate persona' called 'Majestic Ape' where she wears a blond wig, red ski mask, sunglasses, and all black. </p>
<p>Her material comes off as try-hard edgy and it focuses mostly around sex, old 50s-70s pictures, flashing colours and subtle imagery, as well as pizza and children/pedophilia. </p>
<p>It is currently in question how and why she is involved in all of this. </p>
<p>Comet Ping Pong is advertised as a family friendly place, and all of their event flyers say "all ages" despite having clear sexual tones. </p>
<p>Having a hard time finding a video because she seems to be taking them all down with copyright claims. </p>
<p>This is the only one I can currently find but has commentary and is not the full version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlhBn_zSIro</p></p>

        <p><p>It's evident to me now that Amanda Kleinman was most likely herself tortured beyond the breaking point to become one of these child handlers,  or recruiters and this is merely code for furthering her duties, Monarch style. </p>
<p>See also,  Sasha Lord, lead promoter @ comet ping pong and,  errm "Girl Scout for life". </p>
<p>Yeah, right. </p></p>

        <p><p>In the apes santa vid, it mentioned jacking its worm to American Apparel ads or something and American Apparel was just in the news CEO Dov Charney filmed himself having sex with staff and models, sexting models and having underage porn. The American apparel ads are child porn. No wonder. </p></p>

        <p><p>Uh, yeah...I dont think CHILDREN care about hipsters when creepy Amanda Kleinman is sitting in front of them wearing preferred kidnapper regalia reading a christmas story about pedos and masterbation. Of course the trolls think this behavior is okay and normal-you have grown up around it, its all you know.</p></p>

        <p><p>I was thinking of that. We have been seeing pictures of dead animals from these people too. The eyes of a dead pig, a slaughtered pig ripped apart, several men cutting a calf open in Biljana Djurdjevic (Podesta's favorite artist), images of severed goat heads and dead chickens with Marina, monkeys being experimented on, rabid dogs tied up in bathrooms (more of Podesta's artist), possible crossbreeding and vivisection. </p>
<p>There is also a distinct possibility of bestiality, and the use of puppies to create bonds with children who are abused only to be taken away and slaughtered as an induction of trauma. </p>
<p>I do believe animal cruelty is involved in this 100%. </p>
<p>Nobody has really highlighted it yet because the instances of child abuse and rape are garnering most of the attention (justifiably so).</p>
<p>But the animal torture should not go unnoticed, it is a testament to how sick these people are.  </p></p>

        <p><p>That post went directly to the tor hidden wiki link, which has a section for "hard candy"... That said, you can find 600+ sites on google hosting that same list. It's about actions and intent.</p>
<p>Some of the sites regarding the clinton contacts list leak are purported honeypots though, used to collect IPs for anyone investigating. LHOHQ.info you should stay away from.</p></p>

        <p><p>Get Ublock Origin and PrivacyBadger, learn to use them. PrivacyBadger especially because some pages won't load until you let their google API or other cloud loading crap through. I wouldn't worry too much about being guilty for being curious, #pizzagate is exploding on Twitter, thanks to Turkey. So there'll be lots of traffic to obfuscate it. Plus reddit gets tons of traffic anyway.</p></p>

        <p><p>I've been trying to find the lyrics to the songs of this 'apes' band, but no success yet. I haven't seen lyrics of any of their songs on the internet, and its kind of hard to understand what they're singing in the videos.. I did find this video, and it just seems very strange to me. They're also singing about children in this song, and probably more. I'll keep looking for lyrics, who knows, maybe some hidden stuff in there as well. There's also again a pizza seen in this video. </p>

        <p><p>Ok, so I have been trying to uncover some lyrics, what they sing in the 'what we do best' song sounds kind of worrying. Here's what I could understand (ill put question marks behind things im not certain of) </p>
<p>'Come sit on my face</p>
<p>While I'm knitting(????)</p>
<p>The scalp(???) of your mother is (...)like no other</p>
<p>Come take a walk but please don't speak </p>
<p>We're now having (sex??) just follow my lead</p>
<p>You see through your homes and you look through your things</p>
<p>Just take what you need</p>
<p>We do what we want and we go where we please</p>
<p>entitlement doesn't come free. </p>
<p>Cause this is what we do what we do best</p>
<p>Well you feel like a frog, so jump in </p>
<p>We'll cut off your tongues (?) for leaving the young</p>
<p>And hence we saw hair (??) we sow'em back on(???)</p>
<p>Then there is a line i dont understand but I swear it finishes with either:'We'll finish by dawn, or we'll finish your daughter</p>
<p>We'll borrow your name for your magazines, a couple copies please (???)</p>
<p>We do what we want and we go where we please, entitlement doesn't come free. </p>
<p>Cause this is what we do, what we do best </p>
<p>(the others?? ) are dead, so count yourself blessed</p>
<p>We're walking, we're talking'</p>
<p>walking, talking</p>
<p>The price of living free, the price of you and me</p>
<p>Cause this is what we do, what we do best. </p>
<p>Others are dead, count yourself blessed. </p>
<p>Sounds to me like lyrics about a pedo being finally out in the open with a child, maybe by killing the parents? Price to pay for entitlement/ living free is killing the parents? </p></p>

        <p><p>I'm trying to do another one, this one is called :'Can u handle this'. another disturbing one '</p>
<p>Can you speak? </p>
<p>You lost your brains to laughter </p>
<p>Strains of thought </p>
<p>She set to 'yes sir' 'no sir'</p>
<p>Can you pass(??) everyone here is talking</p>
<p>Hot lips, pink ass grape flavoured licks (of mine?)</p>
<p>The small owl's in hand??</p>
<p>That you will (be left alone ??) </p>
<p>(you're young??) through the night </p>
<p>Do you feel the transformation? </p>
<p>Back in your home</p>
<p>Alone in your bed</p>
<p>Can you handle this? Can you handle that?</p>
<p>Sacred trials??? Twisted smiles</p>
<p>(Field chose??) with the unfortunate bangs</p>
<p>Hosting pubic crabs  </p>
<p>Clinging  to you up a (horroring???)'</p>
<p>But keep it up </p>
<p>With the fire light bleeding </p>
<p>As the locks are (brown?)  I pull you closer, closer </p>
<p>Same chorus again </p>
<p>And then you hear the majestic ape voice and I think she's saying:</p>
<p>'So you come to see besides, or will you make it to daylight? '</p>
<p>Sounds to me like an abused child victim who's growing up and now he/she has to decide whether she will joining the occult elite and their rituals and perform the abuse on others, or simply get killed off due to not being young enough anymore. And yeah I know im looking too much into it probably but still weird nonetheless. Also, apparently children with pubic crabs are often exposed to abuse. </p></p>

        <p><p>They have an album called 'baba's mountain' and its on spotify. There are some weird song titles on there, such as 'who is left alive' and 'organ syrup' (maybe related to spirit cooking?) im trying to listen what they're singing but apparently im deaf as shit lol. I do have to say I find it very strange that they do not put up lyrics for their songs, if they're quite an established band that is signed with a record label, and who have their songs on spotify, you would think they would have some lyrics somewhere, but nope. This article really made me think as well, look at what the author is saying: </p>
<p>'' And they just won’t shut up. You think all the consistently nonsensical lyrics about lions and children and owls and riding on the green bus are about as bad as things can get. And then on “Imp Aah” they go and outdo themselves: “The imp, the oh, Baba ha ha ha, yippee aye cokes, chicken oh woah oh” actually comes out of someone’s mouth. ...At least that’s what it sounds like. We’ll never know for sure since they were wise enough not to include a lyrics sheet.''</p>

        <p><p>Ok Im busy with another one, called :'Zookeepers night out, this also sounds like it has fucked up lyrics in it, and it actually sounds like its threatening people who want to come forward about this. </p>
<p>'When you leak the net with all </p>
<p>I'll bring you down, to (crawl??)</p>
<p>How many of these will lose the hunt???? </p>
<p>To cheap us out to lunch</p>
<p>And now.. the time to feed..(the three/tree??) followed by animal growling noises</p>
<p>The next line I just cannot make sense of, it doesn't sound like anything comprehensible</p>
<p>'They're ratting out/acting out on whims</p>
<p>Locked in gates, we need to be</p>
<p>Took nude shots, take a peak</p>
<p>Place your balls in the puss (ok what?) </p>
<p>You want to talk, explain</p>
<p>Let us decide your faith. </p>
<p>Here to watch news/nudes, save you</p>
<p>Nothing since last year </p>
<p>Anymore keys back these?? </p>
<p>Nothing since last year</p>
<p>Here for one more, encore</p>
<p>Nothing since last year </p>
<p>Tried to hide the sin, but late</p>
<p>(the cryptic sense they gave???) makes no sense to me but can't fucking hear/understand it lo</p>
<p>l Miss you so bad to go down, from letdown??</p>
<p>Legs are so tired just sit this one out </p>
<p>Please, be kind and mind my suit </p>
<p>-------- Come to lunch???) checked out when you work it out? </p>
<p>A lot of it I cant make sense of but this sounds like a downright threat to anyone uncovering these pedo secrets. Especially the part about leaking to the web and the nude pictures and gates are very alarming about this one. </p></p>

        <p><p>Okay, at first I thought they were being unfairly attacked, but something is definitely up. Since, they're relatively young, I think they are victims of this (MK-ULTRA). They would then have DID and not remember a lot of what happened, as their core self disintegrates, due to trauma, and multiple selves re-integrate. They're the weakest link in this chain, so perhaps that's where the investigation should continue.</p></p>

        <p><p>Its just really shitty performance art, you guys are being ridiculous.</p>
<p>Don't put your own opinion on what you think art should be, because people actually think there's some 'deeper meaning' that the artist is trying to convey with shit like this. Don't get me wrong, its is FUCKING CREEPY and just plain crap, but thats what she's trying to do.</p></p>

        <p><p>So yeah, its you making it up, like half the people in here.</p>
<p>Either way, this whole thread just shows how people scream evil at something they don't understand or comprehend. Truthfully I don't understand the message behind her art either, but that's all it is, shitty performance art which no one gets except Amanda(And the Podestas obviously). But jumping to the conclusion she's involved in a paedophile ring is to far a stretch.</p>
<p>Focus on the Podestas, we have nothing but the emails and as of this minute they are compromised, we still have no confirmation from Wikileaks they actually sent them.</p></p>
