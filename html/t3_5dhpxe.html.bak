        <strong>It's about crime and blackmail, not "Satan" folks. Let me break it down.</strong>
        <p><p><em>This is a random throwaway account for privacy and security reasons. I have a bit of personal knowledge and experience that I think is very relevant and I wanted to share it.</em></p>
<p>I'm not 100% convinced of any of this. There's smoke but no fire yet IMHO. Franklin had multiple abuse victims and witnesses who came forward and in some cases maintained their stories in the face of horrendous opposition and organized attempts to discredit them. I don't see that here <em>yet</em>. It's possible that all you've got here is some kind of kinky swinger scene around DC involving BDSM and maybe drugs, and that all this "code" is code for that stuff.</p>
<p>But I digress.</p>
<p>I'm here because if this is really is what it looks like, it's something very very ugly and it needs to be exposed. If you guys and gals want to have any chance of doing that, you need to understand what's really going on here and avoid falling for disinformation and smokescreen bullshit.</p>
<p>For the rest of this post assume it's all true.</p>
<p>First thing you need to get is that this has <strong>nothing whatsoever to do with Satan or the occult</strong> in any authentic spiritual, metaphysical, or "religious" sense. The perps here may indeed use that imagery but they're using it for a specific set of reasons that I'll get to later. They don't "believe" in it, and on the flip side the vast majority of people who do practice occultism or hold alternative spiritual beliefs do not engage in child abuse and would be horrified by it.</p>
<p><strong>This is about serious big-league organized crime.</strong></p>
<p>Let me break it down for you.</p>
<p>Many if not most serious organized crime outfits including but not limited to the "mob," narco cartels, serious street gangs, etc. have some form of initiation. It often involves stuff like somber oaths (loyalty, "omerta," etc.), tatoos or special clothing, ordeals, a background check (yes they do this), having people vouch for you, and so on, but there's almost always something more.</p>
<p><strong>There is almost always a crime of initiation.</strong> There's something you have to do to prove yourself before you can become a "made man" (or woman). Usually it's a serious crime like a murder, assault, etc. Street gangs and the mob often require a hit. White power gangs often require the assault and beating or murder of a hated minority. There are many possibilities but it has to be something big.</p>
<p>This crime of initiation serves three purposes:</p>
<p>(1) <strong>Solidarity</strong> -- once you've done it you've "broken bad" and there's no going back. It proves your seriousness and gives you something in common with your new wiseguy or gang banger clique.</p>
<p>(2) <strong>Blackmail</strong> -- your peers and most importantly the leaders of your gang or mob now have something on you that can be used to take you down should you fail to uphold your oaths. It also means that if the gang's in trouble lower level members can be sacrificed to the authorities as patsies to deflect attention from the higher-ups. There's a pecking order.</p>
<p>(3) <strong>Cop Filter</strong> -- undercover cops can sometimes use drugs and screw prostitutes, but they can't kill someone or assault a random stranger. Contrary to the movies this also applies for the most part to spies and other "feds" unless the stakes are high enough to garner an exemption. By doing the deed you prove that you are a real criminal and not someone trying to infiltrate.</p>
<p>Now if any of this "pizzagate" stuff (or Franklin etc.) is true, we are not just talking about ordinary crime or even ordinary organized crime here. We're talking about the big leagues... about serious global-scale "criminal overworld" stuff. This is to street gangs and the mob what the Fortune 500 is to small/medium business or what the Presidency is vs. being mayor or governor of a state.</p>
<p><strong>Organized child abuse and murder would make an ideal crime of initiation for the top of the criminal pyramid.</strong></p>
<p>No undercover cop is going to do that, period. No ordinary spy or intelligence agent is either for the most part. This is something even hardened criminals cringe at.</p>
<p>Think about the three objectives above:</p>
<p>(1) <strong>Solidarity</strong> -- once you've done a deed like this, you've "sold your soul" so to speak. Like I said it's not about "Satan" so that's not what I mean. What I mean is that you've done something so horrible you're going to feel like you can't ever go back so you might as well go forward, and the only people you're going to relate to after that act are going to be others who have done it as well.</p>
<p>(2) <strong>Blackmail</strong> -- even the serious allegation of pedophilia can destroy a person, especially in business and politics. This would be great for enforcing discipline.</p>
<p>(3) <strong>Cop Filter</strong> -- pretty much 100% effective here.</p>
<p>The mob might bust out a pension fund or a credit union. A street gang might run some dope. <strong>These people bust out entire nations' economies and plunge millions into poverty, or start wars that kill hundreds of thousands of people for power and profit.</strong> We're talking about something beyond crime as we would ordinary understand it. While it's not about "Satan" per se, what these kinds of criminals do is definitely evil.</p>
<p>So what about the devil stuff then? Like I said they don't really believe in it or give a damn about it, so why would they use it?</p>
<p>Ordinary mob and street gangs use pseudo-occult imagery as well. For examples look into the cultish aspects of the mob, street gangs' use of pseudo-Santeria, or the use of things like "Santa Muerte" by Mexican narco gangs. Historical examples include the Thugee (origin of the word thug) and the Hashishim (origin of the word assassin).</p>
<p>The main reason they use it is to intimidate. Many people, even those who don't nominally believe in "that stuff," find this kind of dark imagery very intimidating especially if it's presented alongside actual evil and violence.</p>
<p>This also works for the criminal overworld. Intimidation has some value there too-- intimidation of members, of witnesses and victims, and of the public.</p>
<p>But here I think it serves another purpose, namely that of misdirection and the discrediting of witnesses and victims.</p>
<p>If I were a betting man I'd bet that Marina Abramovic has nothing to do with any of this. They might be using her as a supplier of props, and she'd also make a great cartoon villain patsy to feed to the media and the public if this story gets legs. She strikes me as a dumb pretentious shock-jock "aaaaahtist" of the sort that's a dime a dozen in circles like these, and if she found out there was any actual FOAR REALZ crime going on here she'd probably piss herself and run away screaming.</p>
<p>It's <em>possible</em> that she could be involved but that's my suspicion.</p>
<p>Look... many people are going to find these allegations hard to believe. Now throw in some pig blood and goofy robes and surround it with shock-art peddlers like Abramovic and it gets even harder to believe. In most people this stuff brings out the giggles. In the rest it serves to misdirect everyone into outrageous occult conspiracy theory rubbish that only serves to make the topic untouchable to the mainstream press.</p>
<p>So if you want to get anywhere with this, here's my suggestions. First ignore the occult nonsense. It's not relevant and will only discredit you and provide false leads. Instead focus on searching for <strong>witnesses or victims</strong> and on <strong>following the money and tracing business relations</strong>. Look for the man behind the curtain. Ignore the statue and the goofy special effects.</p>
<p>Second try to keep politics out of it too. This isn't about Democrat vs. Republican (Franklin was Republicans remember?) nor is it about Trump or Clinton. This is about serious criminal corruption in DC power circles and it affects everyone.</p>
<p>Satanism is people pretending to be evil. These people don't need to pretend.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I also wanted to mention that if I wanted to cover up something like this, first thing I'd do is make sure to get people like David Icke and Alex Jones talking about it. Make sure the emphasis is on the occult mumbo jumbo and be sure to spread a lot of really outlandish conspiracy theories about reptiles and the Illuminati and whatever.</p>
<p>Making sure the conspiritards get involved would be step one in my damage control plan. Worked for the Franklin scandal, the Vince Foster scandal, the GWB election scandal, ...</p>
<p>Just sayin'.</p></p>

        <p><p>So far I think you're in disbelief and are projecting that onto many of us and the majority of people that have not heard about pizzagate yet.  You're painting a very black and white environment, and you're assuming cops won't do this stuff.  There's already several articles of cops participating in these events.  There are several accounts of children posted here across several decades.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Also we're talking about potentially hundreds of thousands of kids each year (...maybe even more), I really don't think they have that many people who need initiating... I'm sure that the reasons OP gives are accurate, but they certainly are not the whole picture. The Podesta bros seem to be running quite a profitable business by trading these kids like goods. They seem to quite enjoy participating in these rituals themselves too.</p></p>

        <p><p>Not buying it. Your posting disinformation if you ask me.
There is all kinds of evidence the owner of Comet is very paranoid right now he threw someone out of the establishment last night for filming, he's on his heels and it's all linked to the Podesta's, the Clinton's the #SpiritCooking.
People are dying investigating this several in the last few weeks of apparent suicides, one involved in trafficing children in Hatti.
This woman in charge of the amber alert system was caught stealing 30 kids from Hatti and Clinton herself had to go there and bail her out. No this is real folks. Don't buy the disinfo. Keep digging.</p></p>

        <p><p>Here's a primer for those who want to understand this more deeply:</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MQw3gnAkdI</p>
<p>This goes way into blackmail and how it works in power circles.</p>
<p>I'm not denying that these people use occult (really pseudo-occult) imagery for various reasons. I also would not rule out the possibility that some of them believe it, though I doubt it. Problem is it's irrelevant.</p>
<p>It's not a crime to practice weird religion or to be into shock art. It's not a crime to worship Satan. It's also not a crime to be into kinky (adult) sex, swinging, and so on. None of that stuff is relevant and bringing that stuff up just leads into areas that are either blind alleys or discredit you.</p>
<p>It <strong>is</strong> a crime to operate a blackmail network using kids and underage prostitutes, and to use that network to influence Washington politics.</p></p>

        <p><p>First, the reason this is done is control.</p>
<p>But, it's very much satanic.</p>
<p>Listen to the song, Bohemian Rhapsody.  It basically outlines the scheme.</p>
<p>If you need to control 500+ people for congress, this is how you do it.</p>
<p>But, it starts with the satanic stuff.</p></p>

<p>When you have time watch somebody well versed in the occult like mark passio. There are WAY too many coincidences in major events to be coincidences. If you can watch his video and tell me your opinion is unchanged then fair enough.  Whether these dates times etc are intentional or 'guided' is another debate, but I'm positive the connection is real. </p></p>

        <p><p>THANK YOU! I regard this as one of the most valuable contributions in the last 2 weeks here. 
Since the last decade I also think that you can only make it as a career politician / magistrate / journalist if the people that help you propel into the higher regions of influence &amp; power have something on you that can bring you down as well.</p>
<p>If Podesta and/or Weiner have had any active participation in the Madeleine McCann case, I think that that was their initiation into a higher level of the hierarchy.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, the Podestas appear to be pedophiles too who are attracted to Pizza (and the occult Abramovich bullshit). </p></p>

        <p><p>Oh definitely. It's never about religion with these people , it's about using it as an influence on people. They're certainly not satanists and sacrificing children to a dark god, but i bet they're pretending to make it all the more ridiculous. Who's really gonna believe that some of the most powerful people in the world wear black robes and perform spooky rituals, no one. But the kids who slip through the cracks, the one who remember SOMETHING at all, will probably have that burned in their head like nothing else, and when they tell that part of the story of course it sounds like bullshit.</p>
<p>Because it really all is. It's all just pretend to cover their own asses and well have to prove that too...</p></p>

        <p><p>Let's assume for a moment that this really is a Satanic conspiracy that's been ruling the world from the shadows for millennia.</p>
<p>DOES THAT MAKE IT ANY MORE BELIEVABLE TO THE PUBLIC?</p>
<p>If there really is an Illuminati, then "they" CONTROL THE MEDIA AND PUBLIC PERCEPTION.</p>
<p>So maybe try to focus on building a case that sticks to the stuff that <strong>WON'T</strong> get you laughed out of a courtroom.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't think you can assume Satanism is an inessential element of the conspiracy. We simply don't know enough at this point to say for sure, and it would premature to rule it out as an important factor. What we do know is that these activities are linked by Satanic/occult rituals, and regardless of whether these rituals are fundamental to the conspiracy or peripheral to it, they serve as a key to help us unlock the code. And therefore, I say, we should continue to pursue any leads we have regarding the Satanism aspect. </p>
<p>And also, I believe we can do this while acknowledging that not all Satanists are pedophiles or have anything to do with this. It could just be a certain sect or cult of Satanists that have nothing to do with other people who identify as Satanists. </p></p>

        <p><p>I agree with most of this OP. I have read of one very well known Australian politician that used to fly young boys in his helicopter and abuse them while he wore a duck mask, who would believe the kids? I also believe that paedophilia is a powerful trip for them, they truly are sick fucks that like to hurt innocents. The occult is just ceremonial, I'm sure it goes back generations to the birth of secret societies and if you ain't in the club you're a nobody. I see your point about the artists being useful idiots and also a great way to launder their cash. My thought is we need to do as FBI anon said and follow the money. Human trafficking is worth more than drugs, apparently. What do we know about the South Korean textile company SAE-A, who opened a factory in the Clinton's industrial park in Haiti? The textile industry is notorious for trafficking. Who ships the goods? Look into companies like Seaboard Marine and their interests. it would be easy to fly under the Radar if you shipped between Haiti and Miami. One not for profit organisation that caught my eye was Kristi House, they are a child welfare and trafficking advocacy but the board of directors is full of ex government officials and even a psychiatrist that held VERY high positions at Walter Reed Medical Centre and Letterman Army Medical Centre at the height of MK Ultra experimentation in the 60s.I think Pizzagate is on the money but it's not the bigger picture.</p></p>

        <p><p>Sorry but no,it is about their religion,even if you don't want to call it "Satanism". I'm not sure what the hang up in people's minds is about this subject. Too much red pill for some? I guess i'm pretty jaded to the occult goings on in the ranks of people this is about but let me assure you, everything else they are doing is for one goal and that is directly tied to their worship. Dismissing that is pulling the foundation out from under this thing. The occult symbolism and ritualism going on in all this is slapping you in the face its so blatant.</p></p>

        <p><p>As someone who believes this does has to do with the occult, I think the best course of action,to make it more palatable, would be to de-emphasize the occult aspects. After all, the alleged charges are heinous enough to put people away for a good while without any dark magic involved.</p></p>

        <p><p>Actually, many Jews worship Satan openly. There is nothing new about child rape, torture and sacrifice. It is called BLOOD LIBEL. It is the reason the Jews have been kicked out of places at least 109 times. Yes, the Jews use their pedophile networks to blackmail politicians, but also seek to make them worship their god Moloc.</p>
<p>The e-mail regarding sacrificing a "chicken" (young boy) to Moloc is just one glimpse into what is going on.</p></p>
