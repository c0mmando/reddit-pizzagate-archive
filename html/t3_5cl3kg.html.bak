        <p><p>The very last part of your post shows a response from the supposed creator of iSteg referencing pizza.  Can you post the question that was asked of him?  The questioner likely baited him into referencing pizza, and then had his question cropped out to make it appear more menacing than intended.  It's important to leave in context when possible.  The spiderweb is huge, and it's important not to try and trap people in the drag net that do not belong there.</p></p>

        <p><p>Also, another note.  A butterfly is a pedo symbol, but it is also a common symbol.  More common than the others, so you will see more butterflies than, say, the triangle thing or the double heart.  Does every girl with a butterfly tattoo have pedo tendencies?  I doubt it.</p></p>

        <p><p>This could be something, because I'm fairly sure the Podestas and co. could have gotten access to much better PRIVATE software than what the general public could acquire by searching "free steganography" on google.</p></p>

        <p><p>It could be something.. </p>
<p>Most likely a honeypot. </p>
<p>That reeks of the Feds to me.  To be so brazen with an unknown commenter on the Internet.  I know these people are brazen, but everything we've seen so far it extends to known and trusted associates.</p></p>

        <p><p>The Podestas must have downloaded it publicly because the power structure that forced them to kidnap Madeleine McCann personally wished them to do it. They just love to flaunt it in our faces.</p>
<p>I bought they are behind iSteg as well, just look at that logo.</p></p>

        <p><p>Repost (from the older thread on the same subject). See IMPORTANT WARNING at the end.</p>
<p>OK, I looked into it. The info is taken mostly from these /pol/ threads:
<a href="https://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/97865523">1</a> <a href="https://is.4chan.org/pol/1478847519753.jpg">2</a> <a href="http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/97839694">3</a> <a href="http://archive.is/8ZQhp">4</a></p>
<p>TLDR: an anon found a 2-byte string "PK" in the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/10037">pizza.jpg</a> file. He contends that shows the beginning of a ZIP archive, concatenated at the end of the JPEG. I haven't seen anybody able to extract the ZIP or even prove this was done with iSteg (and actually iSteg claims to use encryption/steganography, so no such clue would exist).</p>
<p>This is a hoax (or the Anon is good intended but wrong). There are not 1 but 2 "PK" inside the file. As there are in any sufficiently long sequences of bytes: any two consecutive random bytes have a probability of 1/255^2 of being "PK" (50 4b in hex). In no case is there a valid (full) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures">ZIP header</a>: 50 4b 03 04 <em>or</em> 50 4b 05 06 <em>or</em> 50 4b 07 08.</p>
<p>I'm not ruling out hidden content inside the images. Actually that's a good idea to look into. But this is not it.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT WARNING</strong></p>
<p>If I was a person behind this, a pedo being investigated by 4chan/reddit, and wanted to hack/identify people involved in the "investigation", I'd try to get people to submit the picture to a website I control, or download/install a binary I've compiled. This <a href="https://mega.nz/#!3xcwRKrI!tAtSOFX2LHRDbflPxzIA3ZEpfNXUPFmmpbxhWPKJQ6c">original /pol/ thread </a> does that with fotoforensics.com and iSteg (you have no reason to trust "Hanynet" or the iSteg binary unless you check the code source and recompile it yourself).</p>
<p>Indeed, if I want to know who you are (your IP) all I need for you to do is click on a link I submit to you. If I can get you to execute my software ("check out this amazing forensics tool I found that'll allow you to understand everything"), I've just hacked your life.</p>
<p>See this <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5cgv3x/if_i_was_being_investigated_by_4chanreddit_and/">thread on the subject</a>: if you've downloaded and run iSteg, <strong>you may have been hacked by a pedophile</strong>. </p></p>

        <p><p>encryption on the ZIP header?  I don't want to check, don't want to run iSteg specifically when the creator writes that he can cook good pizza lol</p></p>
