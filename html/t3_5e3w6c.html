<blockquote>
<p>Colleagues, </p>
<p>Charge Robinson, Embassy Monrovia, just called to report that Mr. Fosnight has committed suicide. He was found in his home at approximately 0500 EDT. The RSO is on the scene and Monrovia's consular section is aware of the situation and will work to repatriate the body. UNMIL is working to determine who from the UN will call Fosnight's next-of-kin. Post had no further details, but will continue to provide them to Ops. The Liberian Minister of Justice has asked UNMIL representatives and Charge Robinson to attend a meeting at 0730 EDT to discuss press responses. The Watch connected the PA/Press duty officer to Embassy Monrovia. </p>
<p>ACTION REQUEST: Embassy Monrovia has requested press guidance from the Department as soon as possible, preferably before the 0730 EDT meeting. The Embassy prefers NOT to issue a joint statement with Liberian or UNMIL representatives. The Embassy is closed today, but the Charge will be available by telephone. Ops has informed the CA/OCS, AF, and PA/Press duty officers by telephone, and stands by ready to assist. </p>
<p>Regards, Stephanie L. Hallett</p>

<p>One correction: Fosnight's passport was not / not seized. Fosnight says he can't find it (which is interesting, since he says he planned to fly to Sierra Leone this afternoon). And one update: So far, all the Liberian lawyers contacted have refused to take the case. - Brooks Robinson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<p>Here is today's update. Sunday has been eventful. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fosnight was arrested about 40 minutes ago and is under house arrest. His U.S. passport has been seized. The Consular Officer is aware and has passed to him (via the RSO, who's on the scene) the names of three local lawyers. The RSO reported that Fosnight is also seeking to be in touch with a U.S. lawyer. </p>
<p>The Consular Officer will send a report of arrest cable tomorrow, and stands ready to meet with Fosnight. </p>
<p>The GOL has formally asked UNMIL to assist in making sure that the house arrest is effective, in order to ensure that Fosnight's rights are protected and to minimize flight risk. - Getting to this point involved a harrowing six hours. This morning at approximately 11:00 am, the Liberia National Police, accompanied by UN Police and our RSO, went to Fosnight's apartment to carry out the arrest. Although Fosnight had been under LNP surveillance by five officers, he managed to leave the apartment at around 10:00 in his UN-marked vehicle. (The Director of Police will be investigating how that happened.) Airport, immigration, police, and UN authorities were alerted. </p>
<p>At approximately 3:00 pm, we learned that Fosnight was still in Monrovia and was in phone contact with UNMIL officials as well as LNP officers. Finally, he agreed to be met by the LNP at his apartment, where he was arrested. He was read his rights, and read the charges, which include statutory rape and exploitation of children, among other charges. Fosnight stated that he and his Sierra Leonean ex-wife (or ex-girlfriend) - the 157 UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764413 Date: 07/31/2015 woman with whom <strong>he adopted the five-year old</strong> - were planning to fly out this afternoon on Elysian Air to Freetown. - At the apartment this morning, the arrest team discovered that Fosnight had left behind in the apartment his five-year old daughter and housekeeper, a young Liberian man of about 20 years. The housekeeper had recently burned a large box of papers and other items outside behind the apartment. There was no computer in the apartment, but there was a router, which was still plugged in. The five-year old has been put into protective custody and the housekeeper is being questioned.</p>
<p>Also in LNP custody for questioning are the Liberian ex-girlfriend and the Sierra Leonean ex-wife. The Sierra Leonean had been in the apartment in the morning and left around 10:00 am, separately from Fosnight. - A team of ICE officers is trying to arrive Tuesday; details TBC.
