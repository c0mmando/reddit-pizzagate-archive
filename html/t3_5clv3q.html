        <strong>We are forgetting something IMPORTANT!</strong>
        <p><p>I had a disturbing thought.... what if this info is being released to help the very people who are committing these heinous crimes? We know that TPTB will use any means to achieve their goals. I don't put it passed them to throw the lower level people under the bus to maintain power. This goes much, much higher than the DNC/RNC, the jesuits, the clintons, the bushes, the rockerfellers, the rothchilds, etc. This is global and still very much hidden. We should keep investigating and find as much as we can and use it to stop this shit from happening. But we CANNOT trust the system that has allowed this stuff to happen and was designed to make it all possible. We have to save ourselves. I'm sure there are people within the government that genuinely want to help but the institution itself is extremely corrupt. We cannot stop at just putting the perps in jail. We must also DECENTRALIZE power as much as humanly possible. Otherwise this will just keep happening. We MUST learn from our mistakes...history repeats itself.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's all coming out, all of our education, government, and media structures we're to neuter us while they go around fucking kids. I'm dead serious, they've created a whole realm of misinformation to essentially create a "Devil's playground" for themselves. </p></p>

        <p><p>I put it all together, here's the guy behind google's propaganda, it's just a way for us to think a certain way https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AizgLUPsp_A&amp;t=2s, had him as a professor before and it all made sense, it's a lot simpler than we realize. Their power comes from seeming much more complex and powerful than they actually are. </p></p>

<p>Here's why 42 is the secret to the universe I am completely serious, everything is based on this nonsense "sparse matrix" science designed to always have us thinking in a state of confusion. </p></p>

        <p><p>No, it is it's own foundation. Although really weird:
http://www.scp-wiki.net/about-the-scp-foundation</p>
<p>It states it is fiction, but not Roleplaying. Lol. interesting? I mean I guess it could just be a roleplaying forum however why would it state it is not roleplaying?

        <p><p>It's in universe role-playing, it's been active for some time now. I kinda think anyone throwing SCP into this is Disinfo but I could be wrong. </p></p>

        <p><p>"In universe" role playing. I guess the closest comparison would be r/nosleep. 
That said, given the scale of things here no connections seem impossible anymore. </p></p>

        <p><p>I have heard about it SCP for a few years now. My understanding is it is basically creepypasta that is pretty polular, like Slenderman </p></p>
