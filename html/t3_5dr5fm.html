        <strong>Context on why a mod was banned for those unaware</strong>
        <p><p>There is nothing against the mod that was banned. He is a mod at /r/Wikileaks which is a conflict of interested. This sub is an obvious biased investigation, Wikileaks is a news source. We don't want the opposition who controls traditional media to have any mirror accusations against us so that they can outflood us on search engines. We have no interest or narrative in the news, we simply collect data and pass it on to authorities. </p>
<p>Hope you guys understand, CTR WILL use this in their campaign of misinformation.</p>
<p><em>IGNORE ANYTHING ABOUT IT FROM HERE ON</em></p>
<p>Let's focus on following new leads and finding repeatable evidence. </p></p>

It's bigger than just being part of r/wikipedia.
