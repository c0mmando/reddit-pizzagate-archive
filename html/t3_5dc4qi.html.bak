        <strong>Have you ever figured out what's the REAL purpose of surrogacy? Putin had.</strong>
        <p><p>Putin had. This is the horror story: http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2013/s3794616.htm</p>
<p>That's why Putin abolished gay adoption and foreign surrogacy in Russia. Not because he's homophobe, but because he learned THE HARD WAY why they shove down our throats this business of adoption through surrogacy.</p>
<p>They are buying children to put in use. I can't even think of it. But I believe surrogacy is another path to follow. Those monsters are buying children and the Soros lobby is forcing every govt to accept and promote it. It's like and endless mine of "free child" for those devilish pedos, just pay a bit and get a toy forever.</p>
<p>I feel like crying.</p></p>

        <p><p>Be careful with this kind of stuff. Alefantis accused Pizzagate of being homophobic, and this is the first time I've seen anything that can credibly suggest that.</p>
<p>I will say that, as a lesbian myself, there are scores of well-meaning queer people who really do just want to start a family. Not saying sinister people won't take advantage of the opportunity, though.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not speaking of gay, I'm speaking of trafficking. Traffickers  don't care about sexual orientation. They can fake being a couple (gay or not), and buy a child with no control. I believe pedo traffickers are already doing that.</p></p>

        <p><p>Right, I understand that. That won't stop outsiders from pointing at this as an example of homophobia, though, regardless of intention. And that was the point I was trying to make.</p></p>

        <p><p>To be far, the narrative we have on Putin is mainly told by the eyes of what the news wants us to know.</p>
<p>Even listen to Hillary, she still lives in this 1950's Cold War mentality where saying something like "Russia" and "Putin" are suppose to scare us because apparantly they are still buzzwords that are suppose to make American's quiver in their boots.</p>
<p>You can't trust these e-mails because they could of come from Russia, boogie monster, can't trust them, but trust me, the one who willingly had all those e-mails deleted.</p>
<p>So while Putin might do certain things that in reality we might actually frown upon, I doubt Putin/Russia are as evil as they try to make use believe they are.</p></p>
