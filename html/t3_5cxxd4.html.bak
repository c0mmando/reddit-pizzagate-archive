        <strong>What is the connection between pizza and pedophilia?</strong>
        <p><p>If this is deemed not constructive or inappropriate for this thread I will remove it immediately. </p>
<p>I have been asking myself this since this story began taking shape, why not a different industry? Something not so publicly appealing with obvious advantages like freight forwarding or warehousing the possibilities are endless and yet it seems to be tied to one of the most widely appealing aspects of culture. I may have answered my own question but it just seems so blatantly non-sensical I feel like there must be some deeper connection. </p>
<p>Today I googled "pizza pedophilia" and on the first page of results was a link to a wattpad story with the header on google reading:</p>
<p>"Pedophile - Personal Pizza - wattpad"</p>
<p>https://www.wattpad.com/story/65600151-pedophile</p>
<p>The story is not there anymore, but I found this archived image created oct 2 2016</p>
<p>https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.wattpad.com/story/65600151-pedophile</p>
<p>Does anyone know of another way to get ahold of this story? </p></p>

        <p><p>There has been loose ties between pizza places and pedos for many years.
Anyplace kids can be observed in public has that potential and pizza is just something kids are attracted to.. That probably helped In the development of the code as well</p></p>

        <p><p>The connection between pizza and paedophilia is obviously "cheese pizza" which is a pretty common way to refer to child pornography.</p>
<p>Source: I'm a paedophile.</p></p>
