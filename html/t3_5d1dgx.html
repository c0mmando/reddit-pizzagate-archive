        <strong>I think there is a strong link between the UN the clintons and child trafficking</strong>
        <p><p>I have been running across many articles where the UN is complicit or more with people who are child traffickers or child molesters. Here are some of the links that I have found:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/29/un-aid-worker-suspended-leaking-report-child-abuse-french-troops-car</li>
<li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse_by_UN_peacekeepers</li>
<li>http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/03/sex-abuse-alleged-car-peacekeepers-160331183645566.html</li>
<li>http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/17/world/accusations-of-sexual-abuse-against-united-nations-workers-are-cited.html?_r=0</li>
<li>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/centralafricanrepublic/12131243/UN-child-sex-abuse-scandal-Tony-Banbury-cries-as-he-announces-six-new-allegations.html</li>
<li>http://www.dw.com/en/bolkovac-un-tries-to-cover-up-peacekeeper-sex-abuse-scandal/a-19082815</li>
</ul>
<p>Countries in question are Haiti, DRC, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Bosnia, etc</p>
<p>The Clintons have been very active in the United Nations children's programs. Just search for united nations children clinton. The current Executive Chairman of UNICEF is Anthony Lake was Bill Clinton's Chief Foreign Policy Advisor. </p>
<p>Who better to bring children from the war torn areas of the world to the elite's doorstep than people with diplomatic immunity and a reason to search out children and "help" them?</p></p>

        <p><p>If this is true, it's more messed up than I'd imagined. But how could they infiltrate the entire UN? </p></p>

        <p><p>What's to stop them! The criminal enterprise just ran their puppet for the presidency.</p>
<p>They will have infiltrated every organisation and institution in the world that could be twisted to their benefit.</p>
<p>If you look at premise.com (linked to the recent phony pedo plot against Assange) you will see it's packed with high level Clinton associates/operatives, and the company itself is a global spying operation (and that's just what they admit to).</p>
<p>It is worse than you imagined because you are likely a good person. These people are trying to steal the entire world for their benefit, and they have on the whole succeeded. We're not trying to stop them, we're trying to undo it :(</p>
<p>edit: Premise proudly boasts on the homepage of having the UN as a client</p></p>

        <p><p>I forgot to say the maybe worst bit about the Premise front company.</p>
<p>www.premise.com/faq </p>
<p>Top question on their FAQ page is "How many countries do you operate?"  Their answer is over 30. Not operate IN, operate. </p>
<p>I think the sociopaths are rubbing it in. Duper's Delight.</p>
<p>They have data down to the household level, AI to analyse big data, the cabal control polling (premise and others can also tell you who to call..), and they operate voting machines and national elections, and the media...</p>
<p>Also the US Intel community I learned today in some talk by former FBI head somebody (linked to on r/pizzagate) had a spying software called Promise they sold to other nations, with a backdoor for USA to gather everything they gathered using it. But I don't know anything about this, I only heard it a few hours ago and slapped my forehead.</p>
<p>The rabbit hole is deeeeeeeep</p></p>

        <p><p>Is it a question of infiltration though? Considering the scope of this and how long it's apparently been around , it could be around for as long as the UN has. Since the <em>founding</em>.</p></p>

        <p><p>Absolutely criminal.  And the fact that NONE of these sources are our MSM is just another indictment of that sick institution. There needs to be some kind of law they've broken that we can put the major shareholders/directors/senior editors in jail for this, because it's beyond criminal--it's perverted and sick that they ignore these crimes and do not inform the public.</p>
<p>Trump needs to tell the UN to get the f out of our country!  I glommed onto the UN after researching the Lucis Trust, which is an organization that was founded along with the UN, and actually has OBSERVER status (!!??) in the UN.  And guess what the original name of the Lucis Trust was?  The Lucifer Trust.</p>
<p>Check it out for yourself at lucistrust.org.  Sick f'ks.  Stop supporting the UN! Refuse to pay them one penny.</p></p>

        <p><p>3 humanitarian workers working in Haiti go missing after their plane crashes near the Dominican Republic coast on October 18th. Why is this story so important? http://www.theledger.com/news/20161018/plane-crash-kills-3-aid-workers-who-were-working-with-auburndale-man-in-haiti</p>
<p>Why is BostonPizza foundation tweeting in honour of one of the missing people ( Benjamin Cole Brown) of the plane crash?</p>

        <p><p>The UN also mandated the special trip that Bill Clinton took to Haiti in 2010 after the Earthquakes.</p>
<p>His first task has no seeming connection with the earthquake however.  Instead of doing anything to help the victims of a natural disaster, he instead worked to negotiate the release of the 10 missionaries that were currently being detained along with Lauren Silsby. </p>
<p>Just to be clear, these were the 10 missionaries that were allegedly with Silsby the <em>first</em> time she tried to cross the Haitian border with a bus full of kids. They were definitely with her the second time <em>three days later.</em></p>
<p>So Bill shows up, and negotiates the release of Silsby's cronies, but can't get Lauren. The Haitian Government won't have it. They want to keep her on abduction charges.</p>
<p>So, Lauren has to take the case to court, where she is represented by Mr. Jorge Torres-Puello, a man who has been arrested and accused of exactly what he is defending Silsby against: Child Trafficking.</p>
<p>A tangential piece of information that ties all of this together is that 20/20 video about George Soros and his corruption. In it there is a shot that shows him and Hillary in Haiti, at some sort of church/orphanage. </p>
<p>I have an amazing, sourced article from the Harvard Journal of Human Rights regarding this topic, backing up what I have said.</p>
<p>Here is the article, the good bits start at page 7.
http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf</p>
<p>I think we should look into the Haitians mentioned in the article, and see if we can't tie them to other sketchy shit.</p></p>
