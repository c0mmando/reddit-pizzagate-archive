        <strong>I made Overview for Comet Pizza Arrangement. The three houses are connected I think. (Started with the building-side picture, you should too)</strong>

        <p><p>Building-sitepicture-text: Stumbled upon this picture on the Comets people archived Instagram. First I compared the walls of the big and the small photo. The numbers 1 2 3 show where it is the same. It is the same room. Now i wanted to know in which building it was. The Instagram also said that this work was done on holiday or something + a comment asked where this was but got no answer.</p></p>
