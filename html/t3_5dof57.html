        <p><p>I know right. I remember a few years ago reading about people's theories that there was a shift in consciousness and how people were gonna start waking up at exponential rates. It gave me hope but still felt like it was never gonna happen. Now all this worrying and over thinking is going to start to pay off. We have effectively helped force a shift in the collective human consciousness....very sureal indeed.</p></p>

        <p><p>This feels like another smoking gun. I did a little searching about the alleged pedo cover up on the island and found this extremely well researched and detailed article:</p>
<p>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-523706/I-known-Jersey-paedophiles-15-years-says-award-winning-journalist.html</p>
<p>Here is a few glaring quotes from the article:</p>
<p>(context: former child at the children's home caught with 300+ images of CP)"Who were the children in these films and photos? Police needed properly to question these men. But they never got the chance.</p>
<p>Hocquart secretly took an overdose of anti-depressant dothiepin and died at Addenbrooke's Hospital soon after his arrest. Was his suicide a last act of loyalty?</p>
<p>DC Cook told me incredulously that a senior officer broke with normal procedure and informed Clack, before he was questioned, that the other suspect was dead. Clack then blamed the dead man for everything, and escaped with a Â£5,000 fine - and inherited one third of Hocquart's wealth, at his bequest."</p>
<p>In short, two men were caught red handed with 100+ videos and 300 images of CP.  Result?  One of the men "suicides", and the partner then puts all blame on the dead guy whilst simultaneously INHERITING the now dead guy's money.  No charge, slapped with a measly fine.</p>
<p>Another suicide quote:</p>
<p>"Thai police believed he had abused at least 300. But he was never tried: on May 12, 2006, Rabet died of an overdose at the age of 57."</p>
<p>As for the atmosphere on the island, well:</p>
<p>"Deposed Jersey health minister Stuart Syvret told me: "My family has lived here since William the Conqueror. But if an indigenous police officer were in charge, this investigation would never have happened. Jersey is an oligarchy, where the elite look after each other."</p></p>

        <p><p>Agreed, PROFESSIONALLY contacting this specific journalist could be helpful.  She has proven credibility as an award winning journalist and is attached to this case. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yes I agree, moving forward we need to look for US Politicians and busniess elite connections to Jersey and or Tavistock and GLP. Wikileaks search emails for keywords related to Jersey. Clinton podesta links and simliarites to pizzagate. Strafor email leaks podesta leaks dnc leaks and panama papers are a good start. One good solid connection to pizzagate could blow this wide open. If you know any anons try to get them involved</p></p>

        <p><p><a href="https://matrixofconspiracy.blogspot.com/2009/05/who-really-runs-glp-godlikeproductionsc.html?m=1">This website</a> showed up in the linked /r/conspiracy thread. It establishes a loose connection between the moderators of Godlike Productions and Eglin Air Force Base.</p>
<p>That point stood out to me because Reddit itself has connections to Eglin Air Force Base. Back in 2013, there was a bit of a scandal when <a href="https://archive.fo/jhvCW">Reddit made a blog post</a> (archive link because Reddit deleted the original post) calling Eglin Air Force Base "Reddit's Most Addicted City (over 100k visits total)". Yes, Eglin Air Force Base generates more activity on Reddit than tech hubs like San Francisco or Seattle. Personally, I don't think all of that activity is coming from bored employees posting cat pictures.</p>
<p>Shortly after Reddit made that blog post, an academic paper funded by Eglin was published on the follow topic: "<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.5644.pdf">Containment Control for a Social Network with State-Dependent Connectivity</a>" (.pdf).</p>
<p>And now it turns out that the moderators of a large, Tavistock-owned conspiracy forum are also connected to Eglin. I wonder how many other discussion boards Eglin is connected to.</p></p>

        <p><p>About 12 hrs ago on the todayilearned sub (I couldn't figure out how to link it here) there was a thread about parents who were found innocent when charged with child abuse who couldn't get their kids back. In the comments I found a interesting link saying it was common for this to happen in the UK and around 100,000 kids are put up for adoption and not returned to their families. Something tells me there might be a connection to it and the social workers actually get bonuses for the more kids they are able to remove and put up for adoption.</p></p>

        <p><p>They also had an oddly compelling AMA with an "elite" member of a ruling family, answering questions through the lense of their ideology. Fascinating, even if the members of the forum are largely idiots. </p>

        <p><p>I remember that thread it was very interesting and I think it was genuine for the first couple pages. Then the OP disappeared and someone with registered account named "Merit" seemed to take over the thread as the OP, very strange. It was as if originally it was really someone with connections and then GLP took it over to try and do damage control. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah the link I.. linked.. is only the original guy. The dude who replaced him was a joke when set beside OP; I thought so, too.</p>
<p>I once met a guy who was as easy with being profound as the guy from that thread, just one time, selling him a bag of weed and chatting for a bowl. I remember he used the words "uncontaminated seeds" to talk about his garden, and he didn't have anything but a generator for when it got too cold, his car, and his house/small farm. Said he studied instead of watching tv, but he liked to wind down with weed at the end of his day. I can't even really explain how awesome this guy's perspective was, but it was similar to the insider. I think maybe that's why I love this thread so much: because I think I've met a person who practices a similar metaphysic and seen that it's real. </p></p>

        <p><p>I know someone who grew up in Jersey. I just asked him if he remembered hearing anything about Haut de la Garenne and he said he does remember when it all went down. He only remembers hearing high UK government people were involved who never got charged, but didn't think people outside of the UK had anything to do with it.</p>
<p>Anyways, it does exist and sounds like a pretty normal place for the most part from what he has told me before. </p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks for the info. So UK politicians implicated in a huge pedo scandal on a tax haven island worth two trillion dollars gets covered up. The island is 5 by 9 miles mind you. Representing $5 billion per square mile. Doesn't sound normal at all to me.</p></p>
