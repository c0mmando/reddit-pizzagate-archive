        <strong>Need for Private Investigator is allowed by GoFundMe. GoFundMe also known to remove non-agenda meeting fundraisers.</strong>
        <p><p>If someone were to anonymously start a gofundme in the name of needing a private or non-partisan investigation into Comet, there would be one of two outcomes. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the fundraiser is shut down inexplicably as it meets their criteria for fundraising, further raising questions that we are on a correct path, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>funding is met and we can hire a professional investigator to go over not only what we have already found, but also pay people well versed in digging through source and encryption code to potentially find more (as in john.com) </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a half-handed attempt at either acquiring more information, or getting confirmation on suspicions. The creator should be someone of trust such as the owner of this sub, under alias of course, or an other like-minded person that can sort the things worth looking into from the farfetched. Not much detail needs to be put on the gofundme campaign, as the people that are going to donate, are already aware of most of these details, so we can avoid giving too much info for gofundme to use against us in a takedown. Likewise the formatting and context can be copied from a similar campaign, just changing the necessary pronouns to have a reference to point to in the event of a "why me and not them" takedown.  </p></p>

        <p><p>You could say its to investigate workers comp fraud. Very common to hire investigators for this purpose (my company has)</p>
<p>They would have to be vetted carefully. I imagine anyone operating in DC would be well aware of the risks involved with investigating the area elites, and probably have some ties.</p></p>
