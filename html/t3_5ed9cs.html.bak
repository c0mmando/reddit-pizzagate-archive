        <strong>The "La Boum Boum Room"</strong>
        <p><p>So I literally joined Reddit to contribute to findings on Pizzagate. Now, I am not sure if anyone else has pointed this out yet but I noticed one of the photos from James A's Instagram account is of a sign that reads "no phone in "La Boum Boum Room"...when I Googled "La Boum Boum Room D.C." It brought me to this place called La Boum Brunch. I clicked the link and I inspected the website for the cafe a little further. The front page serves as an advertising area for brunch but when you click the link for more info on the Boum Boum Room it reads rules, dress code, and shows all of the sold out tables. Upon further inspection I noticed that under the words "La Boum Boum Room" at the top of the page on the logo it reads "L'enfant room"...yup. You read that right. L'enfant in French refers to a child. </p>
<p>La Boum Boum Room Rules:
One entry time 11pm**
Reservations are required.
Cellphone use is not permitted.</p>
<p>Dress code:
Street wear, Costume
Uniform, Glitter, Gutter,
Glamour, Fetish, Stylish or Eveningwear.</p>
<p>Should we look deeper into this cafe? </p></p>

        <p><p>Google La Boum Boum Room DC just like I did. The cafe comes right up. The sign I'm referring to is in a few of the pizzagate posts that show photos from James' Instagram. Let me hunt it down. </p></p>

        <p><p>Not based off this evidence or your deduction skills. Your efforts would be better spent spreading the information that was on james alefantis instagram or pointing the fact they receive political donations</p></p>

        <p><p>Sorry. Thought I was onto something...but James has clearly been here or he wouldn't have posted a photo of the sign, obviously. The place could be sketchy. Who knows. </p></p>

        <p><p>DC residents have brought up that the famous founding architect of DC's last name is L'enfant. Apparently his name is on many merchandise in the area and im guessing buildings and streets named for him...which just makes L'enfant Room seems  like a tributary name</p></p>

        <p><p>This definately seems like a place James would frequent, fits right into the fetish, kink, deviant vibe. The L'enfant thing pointed out by someone else is the name of the architect of DC. This is most likely just some kink burlesque show. Boy DC is way weirder than I ever pictured, had no idea this kinda shit went on there. Always figured it to be buttoned up political landscape.</p></p>
