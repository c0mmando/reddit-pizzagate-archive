        <strong>Where do the placentas go?</strong>
        <p><p>From the whole #spiritcooking thing, there are talks of using placentas.  I have a conspiracy theory(let's face it, these conspiracy theories are turning into real life and people calling them conspiracies are covering up).  Medical waste for abortions from places like planned parenthood etc, go to Government facilities.  </p>
<p>Who says these lovely people that were running the government weren't getting their hands on placentas, fetuses etc and using them for their sick rituals?  Where else are they getting placentas, unless they are murdering pregnant women.  </p>
<p>Full term abortions, Hillary's fine with it.  </p></p>

        <p><p>If you are looking for articles on pizzagate, good luck.  Don't you run this subreddit?  Info is not readily available on the web on the subject, tons of blogs that aren't much different than a message board post.</p>
<p>Placenta and planned parenthood reply in this thread too.

        <p><p>I <em>assist</em> in maintaining the site. One of the goals of the moderator team is to promote content that demonstrates replicable connection to PizzaGate. Dually, the moderators are tasked with keeping posts that are wild speculation/disinformation/clutter/etc. off the boards. Peoples' attention and effort are limited. We don't want it mucked up by bullshit. </p></p>

        <p><p>Birth, abortion, murder.  Those are the ways. </p>
<p>I know exactly what a placenta is.  My wife tried to keep hers, cook it and grind into pills when our last child was born, Hospital didn't allow it.</p></p>

        <p><p>You need to go back to high school if you think I said the only way to get a placenta is to murder a pregnant woman.  Check your reading comprehension skills.  My theory is they get them from abortion clinics and if not there, then where?  You could include hospital medical waste as well, too, I'm not going after abortion clinics, just the sickos obtaining placentas from somewhere </p></p>
