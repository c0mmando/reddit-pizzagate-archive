        <p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Police report of the events of the case are inconsistent for a variety of reasons. Initial investigation said multiple individuals, lead investigator was replaced after suggesting that the parents might have been involved. New explanation for the case says one suspect. It's a very confused mess of a case.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Not yet. We're lacking in leads available to determine the whereabouts of Tony and John within that timeframe.</p></p>

        <p><p>If it turns out that either of the Podestas were in Portugal on May 3, the probablity that they were involved will increase to roughly .9.</p>
<p>Right now the probability that they were involved is .7.</p></p>

You can see the same sketches on the board. This video was from 2013, posted in 2013.</p>
<p>It appears either John Podesta deleted most of his emails a day or two after she went missing, (or wikileaks/wikileaks source tampered with them to make it look like he deleted them)</p>
<p>Investigators know who kidnapped her but can't arrest citing international law. Note a lot of the discussion is speculation.

<p>Note also that Madeleine is a ward of the High Court of England and Wales. Parents hands are tied. </p></p>
