        <strong>2,107 HIDDEN Podesta emails. Not listed in WikiLeaks index. Get grepping!!</strong>
        <p><h2><strong>NOTE: "HIDDEN" in this case means either not listed <a href="https://file.wikileaks.org/file/podesta-emails/Maildir/cur/">here</a> OR not searchable via keywords on WikiLeaks' search page. I haven't checked each individual file for whether they're not indexed or not searchable. You can STILL ACCESS THEM if you type the email-ID directly via the URL or the search page.</strong></h2>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>WikiLeaks offers an "entire raw dataset" file (https://file.wikileaks.org/file/podesta-emails/podesta-emails.mbox-2016-11-06.gz) that I find hard to work with, so I decided to download ALL the raw emails as individual files. I did this using the bash command below. Long story short I realized there were some emails that either <em>weren't indexed</em> on the file.wikileaks.org subdomain, and potentially emails that you <em>can't find via keyword on WikiLeaks' search page.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complete email set (3.3 GB): Uploading, will edit with link. See relevant script below. (EDIT: I'll have this up and in a torrent by tomorrow, including the one email I missed, 51644. Also considering adding the attachments into it.)</p>
<p>sha1sum:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hidden email set (111.52 MB): <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/aqpf2f8h7mpqefs/podesta_hidden.7z?dl=0">Dropbox link</a></p>
<p>TORRENT LINK: https://www.mediafire.com/?d3i0lgjxhkhk9jr</p>
<p>sha1sum: aefb74e0d899e24d494b7e901cae47c878416159 </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>List of hidden email IDs: http://pastebin.com/0RYFWXBi</p>
<p>List of <strong>missing</strong> email IDs: 51644 (not in the "hidden" pack, somehow I missed it, link here: https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/51644 SORRY!!)</p>

<h2>------------------------------------ NERDERY WARNING! ---------------------------------------------------</h2>
<p>If you want faster download speeds or it gets deleted from dropbox or you don't trust me or you just like archiving or something, here's the command I used to gather these files. Linux only (cygwin might work), requires <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">parallel</a>.</p>
<pre><code>seq 1 59258 | parallel -j20 wget -F -nc -U Mozilla https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails//get/{}
</code></pre>
<p>Set -j20 to however many threads you think your box/connection can handle. 20 was decent for a Kali VM with 8GB/2 cores dedicated. Took around a couple hours though.</p>
<p>Then you might want to rename them to .html or .eml or something:</p>
<pre><code>seq 1 59258 | parallel -j50 mv {} {}.html
</code></pre>
<p>You'll get some move errors 'cause there are some emails actually missing.</p>
<p>If you just want to quickly download the hidden emails, save the list from pastebin (hidden.txt) and do:</p>
<pre><code>cat hidden.txt | parallel -j20 wget -F -nc -U Mozilla https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails//get/{}
</code></pre>
<p>Then rename them:</p>
<pre><code>cat hidden.txt | parallel -j50 mv {} {}.html
</code></pre></p>

        <p><p>Actually, people who believe this don't have autism and we are just your average people from all walks of life. I actually almost voted for Hillary because I didn't know about all this when I voted. This could be the demise of the democratic party. I know I won't vote without thoroughly looking into a candidate or trust the main stream media about it ever again.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Why does that matter?  Does it surprise you that there were a lot of issues that many of us liberals had in common with Donald supporters?  We didn't agree about "the wall" or registering Muslims, or all his other nastiness, but we did agree about what HRC and the DNC were up to, and what the corporate media were up to.  </p>
<p>If it does surprise you, then you probably were surprised when HRC lost.  </p></p>

        <p><p>its a silly /pol/ joke. Basically, when you post on /pol/ it puts your country's flag beside the post ID. Flags are very important to identifying what form of poster you are and they often establish what form of treatment you will get from other posters. Canadians are called "Leafs", Americans "Ameriburgers" or "Americunts", and Turkish people are called "Turkroaches". Funny enough they are higher on the social ladder than Canadians are at the moment. </p>
<p>Really its all horseshit, but it creates a wealth of memes and inside jokes that bring a lot of life to the "community" on /pol/. </p></p>

        <p><p>No, I did not. I wasn't sure about that particular model, but I bet anything if you sent an email around with the words "free stroller" you would get a million people asking you what make and model. Some of them cost as much as cars. </p></p>

        <p><p>the beanie babies email was <em>really</em> odd. it specifically stated that the stuffed animal toys "got along very well each other" and i believe there was some other reference to their "personalities".</p>
<p>there was another email on the same law school mailing list about the "consumption of ice cream" where one person said something about ice cream in the subject line as an attention grabber, then somebody else replied saying he "considered ice cream, its purchase, and its consumption to be extremely serious business". not that anyone doubts it by now, but obviously this validates the notion that this is frequently used "code language" in such a community.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah just read that one, dude was saying that some of the Beanie Babies were sassier than others. Hmm ok, so the guy who wrote that email works at the Pew Research Institute according to his LinkedIn profile.</p></p>

        <p><p>Is it possible to manipulate the recipient/sender fields when sending the email? There are some announcements@law.georgetown.edu that are worded very differently than others. The ones that seem normal are very wordy and have professional sounding subjects.. and then there some that have attention grabbers, short and weird language. </p></p>

        <p><p>I recall seeing this picture among previous emails, but I cannot confirm it at the moment. I remember that I went through all of the emails from ebay/amazon and all of podestas purchases. 
Much, much children related stuff. Would be great if someone could dig into it because I cannot do that at the moment. </p></p>

        <p><p>It starts getting creepy when these people start talking about it. That jimmycommet fan that went by the name of werkinonmahnightcheese had his profile pic on IG with antlers before he made his account private. He had small coffins and a white Van (wtf) in his pictures as well.</p></p>

        <p><p>Okay, something is UP with these georgetown emails. I got bamboozled by shills when I posted about suspicious ones. Could it be possible that the recipient and sender names can be manipulated when sending emails? I feel like that would be something that could be done by someone who knew more about computers than me. EBW364 doesn't appear to be a room at georgetown, or anywhere else for that matter. The first thing that comes up when you search it is a page from sexxfeed.com that doesn't show anything and isn't archived. It's a porn site. These georgetown emails need to be looked into..  </p>

<p>here's the post I was referring to with the sketchy georgetown emails. If it's a possibility that the sender/recipient names can be modified when sending an email, there is definitely something going on here. </p></p>

<p>you mean when people made fun of you because you 'felt sick' over some cat lover personifying their dead cat as cat lovers commonly do?</p></p>

        <p><p>OK - to clear up a few things, the stroller was an email sent to a large distribution group that podesta just happened to be a member of.</p>
<p>The "weird" attachment is, if my memory serves, just a default attachment when there is a problem attaching files.  Could just google it, but its something similar.  See them all the time.</p></p>

        <p><p>To date the only thing I've seen that has decoded most of these code words has been a screenshot of a 4chan post listing each word with it's counterpart. </p>
<p>Do you know of any actual evidence that can be used to confirm, for example, that walnut was known as a code for person of color or that pasta was code for little boy prior to people saying it is in connection to pizzagate? </p>
<p>It's something I've brought up a few times, but I've never gotten an answer so far. </p>
<p>Obviously some kind of code is being used in some of these emails, but I just don't know how it's known specifically what these codes mean. Basing it all off a guy on 4chan just saying these are what the codes mean seems like a serious leap of faith. </p></p>

        <p><p>It's not at all obvious some kind of code is being used. I haven't seen a single email that seems to use pizza /pasta as a code word rather than food.</p>
<p>But I definitely agree that the 4chan as a source is pretty shit. I'm starting to feel like this theory is perpetuated by trolls trolling trolls.</p></p>

        <p><p>The one that says a handkerchief was found with a pizza related map on it seems like a good example of possible code speak, and there's a few others where the use of certain words comes off as strange. Though none of it indicates any one word is code for anything in particular. If it's something they're covering up then they could be talking about drugs, adult prostitutes, or even some real shady election related stuff. It could also very likely be that they just have a strange way of talking.</p>
<p>Hell, with how into the art scene all the wealthy people connected to this seem to be if there were a big crime ring being covered up it could even be some kind of black market art dealings going on. That seems like a pretty plausible crime an extremely wealthy art collector could find themselves involved with.</p>
<p>But I do agree, without any sort of real confirmation that any of these words are known code, a significant amount of the emails seem like the logical conclusion is that they're really talking about real pizza and pasta. Even if they were involved with some kind of criminal ring that was using a pizza shop as a front, a lot of talk would just have to be about the real pizza being served at the criminal pizza shop they're constantly frequenting. </p></p>

<p>How is [THIS] (https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55433) not odd??</p>
<p>"The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has <strong>a map that seems pizza-related</strong>. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want. I know you’re busy, so feel free not to respond if it’s not yours or you don’t want it."</p></p>

        <p><p>Well first of all: map = semen is claimed by one single anonymous dude in a 20 word comment on fucking 4chan, and then being taken as fact by thousands of people here and all over the internet. I have looked hard for any other source or reference to this and I'd gladly change my mind of you could show me a different source for the claim that doesn't lead back to that 4chan comment.*  </p>
<p>Now even if we assume that pedophiles use this word as code for semen we still have to consider which is more likely being communicated in the sentence:<br>
The realtor found a handkerchief (it has semen on it and seems to be related to pedophilia). Is it yours?<br>
The realtor found a handkerchief (it has a map / pizza motif on it). Is it yours?  </p>
<p>So I will give you the benefit of the doubt that the sentence is sketchy. So we assume they are using code language in this e-mail. Why are they using these codewords in only one of thousands of e-mails? Because all other e-mails where you're seeing these suspicious usages of the alleged codewords you are purposefully omitting context.  </p>
<p>*Edit: I'd just like to add how I'm looking (googling) for this so you can repeat the process or tell me why it's a poor method:<br>
+map +semen +language -donald -podesta -the_donald -clinton -realtor<br>
Reasoning here being that any result which talks about clinton/podesta/donald/realtor will be talking about the e-mail and won't actually be a source for the code language but rather just perpetuating the 4chan comments claim. I've tried replacing the semen tag with other things such as ejaculation/sperm, and the language term with code/codeword.</p></p>

        <p><p>Honestly,  as a cryptograpghter I'm highly skeptical of the validity of this key.  Basically any one could make have made up that 4chan key, and it wouldn't be hard to do it in a "convincing" manner.  </p>
<p>If it is a coded language,  as you've said it is just as likely to be coded differently - and the chances of deciphering it are miniscule. </p>
<p>These contexts don't really share many commonalities with instances where this type of code is frequently used in the first place and in my experience,  I'd like to say.  </p></p>

        <p><p>The problem with your argument is the emails led people to investigate Comet Pizza and the other businesses. Leave the emails out after that if you will. 
Then you have to look at where, how &amp; WHY do all of these people AND their businesses have pedophile &amp; satanic logo's. Wall murals at Comet Pizza. What about the bands who perform for all ages? Really? Well THAT'S some bad parenting. And the 'Jimmy Comet' instagram? Please. 
I was cautiously skeptical but No. This IS waaaayy messed up. </p></p>

        <p><p>The "code" from 4chan is where I find the whole thing falling down too.  </p>
<p>Having said that, I think it's pretty clear that they're talking in code. The emails that do it for me are:<br>
The hotdog stand in Hawaii - https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30231<br>
The $65,000 on "pizza/dogs" flown in from Chicago and getting the same "waitresses" - https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html<br>
Getting pizza "for an hour" - https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/51189  </p>
<p>I'm not 100% convinced the code is the 4chan pedo thing but I'm 90% sure it <em>is</em> code for something.<br>
Who "dreams" about a hotdog stand? Who gets food for a specific period of time? $65,000 on pizza and hotdogs for 1 party? </p></p>

        <p><p>I'm sorry for not doing a thourough write-up but I hope you can follow my quick occams razor reasoning:</p>
<p>Hotdog stand in Hawaii: Inside joke or boy brothel in hawaii?  </p>
<p>Hot dog fridays: exactly what it sounds like with office banter, context: https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/emailid/11587 <br>
What if Obama spending $65 000 is a joke about him being a Chicagoan who loves Chicagoan hot dogs.</p>
<p>Pizza for an hour: 1 h dinner? The context of the conversation seems like they're two busy people trying to schedule a friendly meeting.</p></p>

        <p><p>No need to apologise.  </p>
<p>I appreciate occams razor but by trying to apply it, I think you're making my point for me.<br>
Hotdog stand: Inside joke... about what? Boy brothels? Does Podesta even have a hotdog stand in Hawaii?<br>
Hotdog Fridays: If it's a joke, it's a fairly specific one. One that should be corroborated by public records.<br>
Pizza for an hour: occams razor applies more to this one and, in isolation, I'd fully agree with you. But the way it's phrased and given the overall context, it is <em>very</em> strange.  </p>
<p>Honestly, I'm <em>really</em> hoping this is all a huge misunderstanding and there aren't thousands of kids being abused by these people.<br>
But, at some point, the coincidences get so numerous that I do think it pays to have people look into it. </p></p>

        <p><p>I think you missunderstood my point of inside joke.<br>
Hotdog stand in hawaii. What does he mean when mentioning it? <br>
Is it an innocent inside joke (not conspiracy) between the two of them? <br>
Or is it code language for boy brothels (which is what pizzagate theory implies, correct me if I'm wrong)? <br>
Obviously we will never find out but it's really not suspicious unless you're trying to make it be so.   </p>
<p>Hot dog fridays has a lot of context, I linked the e-mail before but I'll quote it instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From: Don Kuykendall [mailto:kuykendall@stratfor.com]
Sent: Friday, May 15, 2009 11:29 AM
To: 'stratforaustin'<br>
Subject: Chicago Hot Dog Friday is here - Break room.<br>
Bayless, this means there are Chicago Hot Dogs ready to eat. Stand up,
take two hard lefts, walk forward and you'll see the break room. Enjoy.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/emailid/11587  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for the directions. And also thank you for coming over to my
desk to make sure I didn't get lost even after giving me the directions.
Those hot dogs were awesome. This is gonna be a weekly thing now, right?  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last of all we get to Pizza for an hour. You're saying that the context makes it suspicious? Well what if I told you that Hamburger is codeword for beastiality, and the podesta leaks has 64 different e-mails talking about hamburgers. I'm sure we could find one e-mail where we can shoehorn my codeword theory in two out of 64 e-mails? <br>
Do you follow my point here of the code words being retro-fitted?   </p>
<p>Then if we go deeper and we question, what are the sources for what these code words mean? We all know cheese pizza is a word used frequently on 4chan. But what about map = semen, or pasta = young girl? They're very specific and the only source which anyone can provide is an anonymous comment on 4chan. Did that commenter have specific insight into the inner circle? Was he whistleblowing on 4chan? Why did he provide so little information?</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>No, you're correct. But I also said that I'm not convinced on the 4chan code, just that it <em>is</em> code.  </p>
<p>I'm sure there's context for HD Fridays. Doesn't mean it's still not code for something. When I said it should be easily corroborated, I mean that if Obama spent $65,000 of <em>tax-payers</em> <em>money</em> on hotdogs and pizza, there would have to be a record of that. I wouldn't know the first place to look though hahaha!  </p>
<p>Like I said, given the context of other emails seemingly being written in code, the pizza for an hour email is very strangely phrased. What the code means however, I do not know. Maybe it's code for run of the mill hookers? I just think there's too many strange coincidences for them to simply be talking about pizza...  </p>
<p>I fully agree with you about the source of the current code words though. A random anon on 4chan is not generally I reasonable source.</p></p>

        <p><p>I just found out about this shit through /r/the_donald, which I don't typically visit other than for a laugh.</p>
<p>This <em>really</em> stinks of "conspiracy" from the get-go. Nobody here actually seems to be entirely serious about any of this, instead resorting to sounding like Discovery Channel's "aliens" guy.</p>
<p>All I can find is speculation, and people who don't understand how Twitter works: "this account was deleted, it must be a cover-up!", "this account wasn't deleted, it must be a cover-up!", "this account that is clearly a bot is sharing porno, must be a cover-up!"... just, no.</p>
<p>Based on stuff like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously some kind of code is being used in some of these emails</p>
</blockquote>
<p>... it just sounds like another witch-hunt.</p></p>

        <p><p>Thank you for asking this. I've been staying out of the fray on pizzagate, but doing some digging on my own (finding nothing but logical explanations for "suspicious" emails or finding dead ends but semi-logical explanations that don't involve even a hint of criminal activity, I might add). I searched high and low for any kind of "proof" that these code words are referenced somewhere other than a 4chan screenshot and found nothing. </p>
<p>Off topic of code words, this whole thing reeks of a witch hunt by people who genuinely don't have any sort of business, political, or social savvy. </p></p>

<p>This sub is blasting the Norwegian scandal as confirmation but if you take a look at what happened there you'll see it makes pizzagate theory even less credible. Their network was hidden on the darknet and exposed by the police. No symbology in their logotypes, no instagram pictures, no secret language, no soulcooking...</p></p>

        <p><p>I feel like some of the circumstantial evidence could maybe potentially correlate with something strange being covered up, but without any actual confirmation as to these code words having ever been used by anyone in this context before, the seemingly coded messages could mean literally anything, so I'm more inclined to agree with you. </p>
<p>If someone found a report from the FBI or an organization like the center for missing and exploited children where they documented pedophiles using these terms in this context I'd be <em>way</em> more on board with the idea that they're speaking in code about a pedophile ring in some of these emails. I'd even accept screenshots of a pedophile forum from prior to pizzagate becoming a thing as half-good evidence to support the codes.</p>
<p>Without these codes being confirmed it just seems to me like this whole thing is getting built on a foundation that's extremely shaky and likely not even there at all. It's like a lot of people are taking a round peg and creating their own round hole for it to fit in. </p></p>

        <p><p>the only email related to this supposed "code" that seems in any way suspicious is the handkerchief/map one, simply because it's inexplicable</p>
<p>the rest of it, especially the "walnut sauce" which comes from a conversation that's completely innocuous to anyone who's not a lunatic, is total nonsense</p></p>

        <p><p>But even the handkerchief email is explainable. Easily explainable. First, many wealthy guys carry around "novelty" handkerchiefs. It's what they do. Like the stupid novelty socks some of them wear. Second, wealthy people look at properties to rent for vacations. Third, Realtors WILL email or call if, when looking at a property, you leave something behind. And, if it's just a handkerchief and you're wealthy, you say "screw it" and don't bother getting it. But Realtors will try to find the owner of the item. I'm not Podesta wealthy. However, spouse and I have looked at properties and one time he left a nice pen behind. Emails were passed about whether or not he wanted it back. </p>
<p>See? Simple explanation unless I completely missed something here. </p></p>

        <p><p>the fact that the conversation took place with a random estate agent largely empties it of any suspicion.  but nevertheless, "pizza-related map"?   is he drawing maps relating to pizza joints on his handkerchiefs (not entirely implausible but still, uh, uncommon)?</p>
<p>its possible that i, as a (relatively) poor millennial have no idea of the frequency with which old rich people carry and treasure handkerchiefs, but idk</p></p>

        <p><p>If the handkerchief is printed with something pizza related, or map related, or a combo of both, it's simply not in any way weird for a rich dude who loves food to have such an item. It's pretty normal. It could also be a pocket square, which is smaller than a handkerchief I think. Same concept. They can be quite elaborate.</p></p>

        <p><p>You do understand the code is specifically created and implemented to give this impression, right?</p>
<p>Before I became a trained DoD linguist, they had everybody take a series of language ability tests called the DLAB (Defense Language Aptitude Battery). After the five-hour exam period, I was pulled aside and questioned because they said they had never had anyone score so high on all the tests and wanted to make sure I wasn't cheating. (I wasn't, and not making this up)</p>
<p>All I can say after reading enough of those e-mails to make a Viking puke is that these adults are definitely speaking in code, deftly most of the time but occasionally clumsily and very discernibly, about illegal acts with children. </p>
<p>There, now in addition to 4chan you have some yahoo on reddit saying the same thing LOL</p></p>

        <p><p>Gosh, maybe this should be cross-posted in r/Iamverysmart.</p>
<p>This "pedo-code" source (a screenshot from 4chan) is simply not a valid, reliable source for such a serious set of accusations. Posters, including me, are wondering why other, more reliable and credible sources for this "code" have not been presented. </p>
<p>I've found nothing in the emails so far that is sketchy. And I say this as a hyper-aware and protective mom, aunt, and sister. </p>
<p>It's like the art in Tony Podesta's house. Pizzagaters keep showing art from the artist that some may construe as inappropriate, yet the art from this artist that's actually IN his house is 100% innocent. Why don't they show the art in his house? Why only show these few examples from the artist? </p>
<p>Because it doesn't fit the agenda.</p></p>

        <p><p>Urban Dictionary? That's not a legitimate source for anything...unless you're trying to explain what "waffle stomp" means to your dad one endless afternoon when your mom is literally at the end of her life, dying of cancer in a nursing home, and you and Dad have run out of stuff to talk about so you start down the rabbit hole of weird, funny expressions you've heard just to kill some time and laugh a little to break the tension and sadness in the room. </p>
<p>Or, so I've heard. </p>
<p>This "gate" needs sources way more legit than Urban Dictionary. Come on.</p></p>

        <p><p>Now,  I don't know about rich,  organized crime style stuff,  but code words aren't used quite in this context within the forums I've stumbled on. </p>
<p>I've spent some time on many different forums outside of the clear net,  mostly groups centered around piracy and whatnot, and it's actually extremely easy to accidentally walk yourself in to an area with a questionable user base.  (It's not like onions are like html,  a novice user may not know how to see where they're headed before following links.) </p>
<p>I never real saw the users of such forums use code words in any major extent,  but who knows - they might do it on the clearnet or over email...</p>
<p>But in my general experience most of the time someone wants to send a double message style plaintext encryption its not done like this in the first place.  Rather than just single words with hidden double definitions the whole sentence and how it is constructed is used to carry the message.  </p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p>A note may be used for repeated variable encounters:</p>
<p>Go to the Walmart and: Meet me at location X </p>
<p>Go to Food Lion and : Meet me at location Y</p>
<p>Buy a dozen eggs: at 12:00</p>
<p>Buy a carton of milk: at 15:00</p>
<p>One could write "Got to Walmart and buy a carton of milk"  to mean "Meet me at location X at 15:00".  </p>
<p>That's how this type of complex double meaning plaintext encoding usually works - it's common and simple.  These emails don't fit the bill for the usage that is taught in most cryptographical education materials.  </p>
<p>Back to the forum users I've seen: most of them are running Tailz with custom anonymity software on top.  Generally they aren't super worried about being clandestine once they're already in a forum sharing pics,  lol,  so they use plain English with the occasional single code word - the common ones like "cp" that we know of.  </p>
<p>Of course,  I didn't spend much time on any of these forums so much of the above is from my cryptographical knowledge rather than a familiarity with these fora.  They could be using a complex code language,  and I've just been fooled.  I kinda doubt it though because I'm not sure how the key would have been simultaneously prolific and hidden. </p></p>

        <p><p>Well yeah,  especially common users of these forums are generally going to be people with just enough technical ability to access the forums.</p>
<p>If anything,  it's expected that organized groups will have better tech,  and will feel even more secure - resulting in comfortability in using plaintext over secure channels.  The better their security and methods the more lax the weak links become in regards to security. </p>
<p>As far as secure channels go,  we will never access them.  We may gleam hints of passing information,  but we ourselves will never see the actual channel. (Which,  may be for the best given the content, actually....) 
Really,  we just need someone in the inside.  </p></p>

        <p><p>These fora are actually shockingly accessible.  It is well known that it is unfortunately very easy to get to these forum accidentally,  let alone if you're looking for them. This is common knowledge to people who spend time outside the clearnet.  </p>
<p>In my experience these users do not use code words in quite the same way as how it is hypothesized with these emails. Not only is it not the standard way of using this method of encryption, but most of the users are confident enough in their anonymity software to use mostly plaintext outside of the super common double words like "cheese pizza". </p>
<p>They may be more clandestine on the clearnet,  but there'd be no feasible way of knowing without a snitch.  </p>

<p>This looks legit to me, you can freeze fresh pasta for six months, if it was a gift from Podest -- perhaps it was high quality and they were saving it for a special occasion? Nothing suspicious IMO.</p></p>

        <p><p>Email <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48627#searchresult">#48627</a> Clinton campaign discussing policy reform. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The second idea is a favorite of mine, as you know, but REALLY dicey territory for HRC, right?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the 2nd idea he is referencing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strengthen bribery laws to ensure that politicians don’ change legislation for political donations. 62%</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hillary's campaign is/was well aware of her corruption. They admit here that she accepts donations for policy changes. I'm not a lawyer, but isn't it illegal to do that?</p></p>

<p>I haven't been keeping up with the leaks so this might have already been covered... But I think one of these attachments is Podesta working with George Soros and others to outline the battleplan for the 2008 elections. Looks sketchy to me. </p>
<p><em>"Control the political discourse.  So much effort over the past few years has been focused on better coordinating, strengthening, and developing progressive institutions and leaders.  Now that this enhanced infrastructure is in place—grassroots organizing; multi-issue advocacy groups; think tanks; youth outreach; faith communities; micro-targeting outfits; the netroots and blogosphere—we need to better utilize these networks to drive the content of politics through a strong “echo chamber” and message delivery system."</em></p>
<p>That sounds a loooooot like this election...   </p></p>

        <p><p>Honestly, It seems like the best way to stop Soros is to get him extradited to Germany. He admitted he worked for a Nazi against his own people and didn't feel guilty decades later, and said this on 60 minutes or something similar recorded. </p>
<p>They've tried guards that simply worked the door at camps that had no hand in actually participating in confiscating property and money or harming anyone directly.</p>
<p>He's a great candidate for the continuation of the nuremberg trials.</p></p>

        <p><p>right, because all the truly decent, honest and non-pedophilic political movements have had an election strategy which is basically just "eh, let's just stay at home and let the people decide for themselves"</p></p>

        <p><p>Honestly if you look at how much foresight the clinton campaign had, its amazing how incompetent they were leading up into the election. </p>
<p>They anticipated Trump and Bernie shaking things up. They anticipated the 'bucket of losers' (basket of deplorables) over at r/the_donald. </p>
<p>Then in the heat of the moment they go out and try and take pepe down, launch that crazy "Why aren't I 50 points ahead?" video, and flat out quit campaigning half way through the race. </p></p>

        <p><p>It went wrong because they were fighting reality, and that reality makes it really hard for most working americans to put up with their bullshit politics with the race baiting, white guilt, femi-nazis and fucked up economics. 
With that in context, you can understand better why they fight so hard with wanting to "control the narrative" – they want to decide for the people what they should be worried about (SJW-stuff) and what they should NOT worry about (reality).</p></p>

        <p><p>Do keep in mind Trump lost the popular vote, which would mean they were <em>on</em> the side of reality, just not enough where it counted.</p>
<p>Let us not forget both sides have their echo chambers - it's no secret that politics thrives on them.</p></p>

<p>Popular as you can setup a box for people to download things from that is not directly linked to you, especially if it is in a country that is not required to obey warrants from your's.</p>
<p>Also popular for uploading this as the speeds are many times better that typical consumer broadband, and it will get you around your own data cap.</p></p>

        <p><p>Trees = children who need to be taken care of/got rid of? 
Tree removal crew = people who are taking care of such shit? </p>
<p>Those are just my thoughts, if someone could verify if there was a storm there indeed it would deny such interpretations</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm just thinking like that because this line seems suspicious :
"the tree and the crew are coming"
How can a tree come/go anywhere? 
EDIT 2: could also be bodies </p></p>

<p>Plus, that snippet makes sense with context: "The storm has already taken out a huge 80 ft. tree and the crew is coming on Tuesday after work to finish taking it down." The full stop is for the abbreviation of foot and not for a new sentence.</p></p>

        <p><p>Awhile ago I found on wikileaks spam emails from macy_rewards and at the bottom of the message was a typical spam paragraph-long sentence that rambled about pizza and pasta, servers names and number of people eating in their party. </p>
<p>It was like a horribly written review about a pizza place buried in a macys_reward spam email. </p>
<p>I found it weird, like a cryptic message sent to a group and now it is gone with all these missing spam ones.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm pretty sure they don't, in the 1st few batches I got some malware opening up chinese email attachments. Least the PDFs had some interesting artwork (nothing CP related, or dodgy otherwise). Pretty stupid of me, I know, but surely a spam filter would have filtered that one out..</p></p>

        <p><p>I downloaded the hidden emails", and all the numbers differed from the numbers in the "hidden email list" on your pastebin. Care to explain this?</p>
<p>On another note, I opened one of the supposed hidden emails "44219.html" in a text program. After the email content (which seemed normal), there was text with a ridiculous amount of consecutive "A"s which seems intentionally/manually put in by someone.</p>

        <p><p>I don't think that it was put intentionally. "A" character in base64 is equivalent of empty byte (000000 as a binary representation) so it was probably a lot of empty data. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64</p></p>

        <p><p>that's exactly it, files sometimes have empty byte null padding in them, a binary file in an attachment probably has a header within the file that's always a specific length, headers contain meta-data about a file. if the meta data doesn't use the full length of the header, the rest is padded out with null bytes. </p>
<p>this sometimes happens at the end of files as well, or as a delimiter in the middle marking different parts to the file (like say a word doc that has a clipart image, within the file itself there might be padding before and/or after the clipart data, the clipart may have a header itself, etc). </p>
<p>so not unusual for uncompressed files to have big strings of empty data. when it's base 64 encoded you see a big string of A's.</p></p>

<p>yeah, it's just padding for the base64 string. it's nothing. </p>

        <p><p>I noticed it because it's exactly what I did when I didn't complete my homework in highschool, but it was due so I opened up the .doc file in notepad, added random letters in the middle of the code to corrupt the file. Then I submitted the homework to my teacher via email, she'd say "it didn't open" and I'll give it to her by hand the next day, so I have an extra night to work on the homework.</p></p>

        <p><p>They're not "A"s, it is likely an encoded binary attachment. The only string in it is "[Content_Types].xml" as pointed out above, the A's are probably some sort of padding or buffer, in other words nobody intentionally typed a bunch of A's in as the OP suggested.</p></p>

<p>You all need to watch this. New information tying the Podesta brothers to Clement Freud to Maddie McCann and they were there at the time. Especially creepy information about Clement Freuds involvment.</p></p>

        <p><p>Also the FBI 4chan leaker said watch out for "Cards".  There is an email of Podesta playing Cards with a girl who looks just like Madeleine McCann.  And if you zoom in (it helps to increase contrast) you can see the same flaw in her eye.  Also looks extremely close to an age projection rendering done of Madeleine McCann.</p></p>

        <p><p>it has to do with the e-mail protocol. lines are limited to 76 characters at a time (and its actually 7-bit text encoding, not even full ASCII, just a subset is used in SMTP transmission - the equals is an escape character), but it basically means "end of line" when you see it.</p>
<p>its totally normal. you're just looking at the very "raw" output of an email message that hasn't been formatted for viewing by an e-mail client.</p></p>

        <p><p>The emails involving Indians are friends of Podesta. They are from Alabama. I read a few emails involving them at least 3 weeks ago when I was looking into the involvement of 1st and 2nd generation Indians as go-betweens between the CF, State, and the target donor.</p></p>

        <p><p>No. But, upvotes on the Original Post (at the very top) can make it "Rising" or "Hot" depending on how many votes it gets.</p></p>

        <p><p>Nice. That's helpful. Another method is just to go directly to the wikileaks page for that email ID and download the attachment that way. So simple I didn't even think of it.</p></p>

        <p><p>Here's a script i used to extract attachments locally, you need the <code>mpack</code> package (on ubuntu anyway)</p>
<pre><code>cat hidden.txt | parallel -j50 "mkdir -p {} &amp;&amp; cp {}.html ./{} &amp;&amp; cd {} &amp;&amp; munpack {}.html &amp;&amp; rm {}.html"

find . -iwholename "*tempdesc.txt" -exec rm {} \;

find . -type d -empty -exec rm -rf {} \;
</code></pre>
<p>this will result in the email attachments in a subfolder of the same ID. those that don't have attachments won't have folders</p></p>

<p>Probably nothing, but I always remember his name from a song someone wrote about him.</p></p>

        <p><p>Email ID: 44339,</p>
<p>This isn't anything new from this leak but it lead me to find it...so I thought others may find it interesting:</p>
<p>Warren Stephens donated 1.5M to the GOP super PAC (who we know gave trump a never before seen zero amount of support), <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgave2.php?cycle=2016&amp;cmte=C00487363">American Crossroads</a>. 
Stephens and his brother Jackson Stephens were also major financial supporters of the Stop Trump movement, as noted on their wikipedia page.</p>
<p>Warren is the brother of Jackson Stephens (Son took Father's name). </p>
<p>Jackson was involved with and backed WJC during the CIA-ran drug running while Bill was in Arkansas. 
Witnesses describe Jack as being addicted to cocaine as well (as Bill). </p>
<p>I'm guessing this was nothing but an attempt to keep his mafia ring going, that may or may not include pizzagate - would not surprise me if more could be found on these guys. Indicates nevertrump is run part by the bush cartel.</p></p>

<p>I posted this 9 days ago and asked Wikileaks for help to explain why I found this by accident because it was indexed .oros but the actual email should Soros.  They said they would check into it but I never heard back.  So if someone was looking for Soros it would not pull up.  This was from Hillary's state dept emails. May be totally unrelated to indexing issue but wanted to bring it up</p></p>

<p>Sorry. I cleaned it up, took out a bunch of jargon, bolded things, and added a "technolingo" warning. Better?</p>

<p>You don't have to download anything. You can access every email directly through the wikileaks URL or via email-ID search. Just be aware that using the <em>keyword search</em> on WL means you're not going through every file on the server, some get left out. It's spotty. For that reason, and that the dataset WL released is annoying to work with, I did this. Thought some other people could make use of it too. It's not like I did it for the karma.</p>

        <p><p>Quick search for pizza:</p>
<pre><code>./58128.html - nothing spectacular
./57392.html - string "PiZZa" part of the pdf attachment or something
./59243.html - recipe definitely a legitimate recipe

./58006.html - See below:
John and I are = cooking along with guest chefs James Alefantis of Comet Ping Pong Pizza and Buck&amp;#= 8217;s Camping and Fishing
This is important I think, it connects 'we the pizza' with it all doesn't it? bucks camping and fishing
It's a fundraiser

./57625.html - another fundraiser, nothing to see here
./58170.html - weird one, PiZZa shows up again as a fundraiser
This one has a lot of AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA in it
</code></pre></p>

        <p><p>57392 and 58170 both have "PiZZa" in an extremely long series of gibberish in the code of the attachment, so it's probably nothing?</p></p>

        <p><p>For what it's worth, I downloaded every single Podesta email from 1 to 59,258 and I haven't found any missing in the entire range. I ran my script daily after each drop, and usually had a handful of zero length files caused by server timeouts and such, but I was able to manually fetch those that failed the first time.</p></p>

        <p><p>are there any exact duplicates?  I sae a tip on one of the chans to check for this.  Wikileaks has never released exact duplicates.  Maybe replies to threads but not exact duplicates.</p>
<p>Why would they be missing from the search engine and all of the sudden available when you use the url?  Maybe somebody was able to intercept the web traffic and insert duplicates when you try to fetch the 'missing' ones(XKeyscore/ECHELON per Snowden leaks)?</p>
<p>Also with the handover of ICANN can they dns redirect?</p></p>

        <p><p>I generated the MD5 checksum of every file I downloaded and did not find any duplicates.</p>
<p>I haven't played that much with their online text search, but if you know of any specific email ID's that seem to be missing, pass them my way and I'll take a look.</p>
<p>As for DNS and other NSA/CIA trickery, I haven't really looked into it.</p></p>

        <p><p>Don't forget to keep an eye out for media collusion, election rigging and Clinton Foundation corruption as well guys, post them up in /r/wikileaks or /r/dncleaks if you find anything. </p>
<p>Not that you guys shouldn't continue to investigate pedogate, but you're one of the few communities still rummaging through these emails, so may as well help find more Clinton scandals along the way. </p></p>

        <p><p>Are you sure they are "hidden"? I took few IDs from this topic (for example 58006 or 58260 or 58851) and searched for the title (advanced search -&gt; subject includes) and it's right there. Searching for full sentence from the content also finds them. </p></p>

        <p><p>Why wouldn't they be indexed though?</p>
<p>another redditor found the soros search term wasn't working but worked as .oros. Might point to Wikileaks being compromised and they are trying to bury the data</p></p>

        <p><p>As in the OP - not found via search bar in Wikileaks</p>
<p>I checked the soros and .oros just then. It appears to be fixed. I guess that's why George Soros's links to the broader spiderweb were only made recently</p></p>

<p>EMAIL 58704
Date: 2015-12-09 05:09
Subject: Briefing memo on guests for tomorrow night</p>
<p>A guest list is attached with the subject "Background on Cooking with John Guests"
It contains a guest list with brief explanations on them. I found this one a little odd;
Matt Donohue:  Another partner at Markowitz – a foodie who took a sabbatical to do cooking training.  </p>
<p>A sabbatical for cooking training? Who calls it "cooking training? To be fair though an attorney would be one of the few professions in america where the job offers time off to pursue other endeavors, and also paid enough while actually working to be able time off from work.</p></p>

        <p><p>Linux command "grep" is your friend for this, but even the built-in Windows search will scan through text/html files. </p>
<p>If you want to get nerdy on Windows, <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-Cygwin">install cygwin</a>, then learn up on <a href="http://opensourceforu.com/2012/06/beginners-guide-gnu-grep-basics-regular-expressions/">grep basics</a>.</p>
<p>The hardest part is wrapping your head around regular expressions (regex) but for simple string searches you don't need regex at all.</p>
<pre><code>grep -r 'Alefantis' ./*
</code></pre>

        <p><p>They're in the same file, if you open the .eml in a email browser like Thunderbird, it should let you just save the attachment. Unconfirmed.</p>
<p>Alternatively if you can see in the text file where the data starts, cut/paste that to a text file and rename it to the proper extension. Kinda kludgy.</p></p>

<p>Site web abominable, actuellement très actif sur le Web Invisible. Quelques images gores disponibles dans cette poubelle sont visibles ICI. Des milliers de photos de gosses violés, torturés, parfois morts, y circulent en toute liberté. </p>
<p>I have not clicked on the link below. Someone with special skills can do that.</p>

        <p><p>I've seen most of these.  I didn't even know they were "hidden".  When the leaks dropped I just did key word searches and was able to read most of this stuff.
When I saw the Title I was really excited hoping to find a smoking gun, then just reading stuff I already knew about.  A lot of good circumstantial stuff for sure and still useful.  Just didn't realize they were "hidden" because I've already seen these.</p></p>

        <p><p>EMAIL 58710</p>
<p>An email chain between John Podesta &amp; Terry Krinvic.
In the emails, then Secretary of Energy Steven Chu pushed hard in order to get former president Clinton to attend an event. Podesta tells Terry to work out a time thats convenient and to "get the bond with CF."</p>

<p>If and when we can confirm the 29th, you should probably do directly 
with Brandon Hurlbut, Chu's Chief of Staff. You can work out time 
that's convenient and <strong>get the bond with CF.</strong> I'll send his coordinates.</p>

        <p><p>Doing a small amount of research on The Wiki Leaks dumps and timelines.    We the public have had ZERO proof of life since early in October when his internet was cut. <br>
Here is the subredit where I did my initial look see. <br>
https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereIsAssange/</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereIsAssange/comments/5e1qc6/welcome_timelines_related_links/</p>
<p>this is a story I found through /r/WhereIsAssange
http://www.opnlttr.com/letter/former-senior-nsa-analyst-jim-stone-insists-julian-assange-wikileaks-not-ecuadorean-embassy</p>
<p>Logical question one should ask...   When did the Podesta emails come out into the relation of the "Theorized" CIA Takover of WikiLeaks</p>
<p>P.S  I am not saying #pizzagate is false I am just starting to worry about the supposed compromising of the source.﻿</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't know enough linux to make use of this information, but please listen:</p>
<p>Things like this need to be taken to places where people are more technically inclined. Take this to chans so our robot friends can actually dig in to this shit. If this is really damning and shouldn't be taken lightly please take it to people a little more on the sec side in /baphomet/. </p>
<p>You're wasting your time with this stuff on Reddit. People that are good with Linux don't frequent basic stuff like this. They obviously have a good feel for security. I'm literally learning it as we speak, but understanding basic commands won't help anyone. This is not the place for this type of content.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't mean to man. I think we need to get things like that in to unfiltered territory first so that robots can scan. After our robots scan, then we disseminate the info in social media outlets such as reddit, twitter, facebook, whatever else.</p>
<p>We should use our robots to scan while they use theirs to flood us. After our robots deem something valuable, they give it to us to give to disperse among the masses.</p></p>

<p>I came here and I understand this stuff.  I wouldn't have known about it otherwise, because I can never find the 4ch/8ch posts anyway.  And TBH I hate 4ch/8ch</p></p>

        <p><p>I know there's a linux subreddit, man. I came from all, and assumed most people did the same.</p>
<p>You guys are more technically inclined than I gave you credit for, or claim to be. I get it. My bad...</p></p>

<p>I still think reddit is a waste of time with anything linux.</p>

<p>And this conclusion was made because of your lack of understanding therefore everyone on this entire site also shares that lack of understanding?</p></p>

        <p><p>Mainly because I have friends who frequent reddit. None of which, whom I'm close to, even know what Linux is for. Maybe two would know what that it's an OS, other than that, nothing.</p>
<p>My coworkers, parents, extended family, none of them have a clue what Linux does. From my perspective, that's not an outrageous claim. Sorry if I live in a podunk town, dude. I guess I can't help that.</p></p>

        <p><p>Exactly your own personal experience. I never did a Linux survey with all the people I know, so I could be wrong. </p></p>

        <p><p>So basically this all boils down to "The few actual real people I know are linux illiterate, so am I, and so is my family in this "podunk" town.  So by that logic, reddit is just me and everyone I know in this "podunk" town, multiplied by several orders of magnitude.  There may be literal millions of them, but they're all the same."  </p>
<p>I mean, seriously... How the actual fuck do you logically come to that conclusion?  Walk me through it. </p></p>

        <p><p>This isn't really that technically involved. The commands are just for filtering out the hidden emails and can be copied and pasted. </p>
<p>After that you just need to do a text search on the directory where the files are. </p></p>

        <p><p>I only say that because I'm just starting out with linux (not as a result of anything on reddit). But I'm very comfortable with other things that I think make me individually valuable to the cause in certain, possibly less significant ways.</p></p>
