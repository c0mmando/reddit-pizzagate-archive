        <p><p>TIL in a podcast that Mark Foley, from the Mark Foley congressional scandal back in 2006 tied to conduct and emails with underage congressional pages, was (wait for it, wait for it): Foley was chairman of the House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children, which introduced legislation targeting sexual predators and created stricter guidelines for tracking them.</p>
