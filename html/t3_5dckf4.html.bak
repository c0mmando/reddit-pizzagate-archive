        <p><p>John (Pedosta) Podesta (the molesta).</p>
<p>James Alefantis "J'aime les enfants" Fr. I love babies.</p>
<p>Amanda Kleinman A man da is really a man. </p>
<p>Anthony Weiner!</p>
<p>Are they for real? I know there are some people here who don't want to talk about this. But I think it's just too damn obvious to brush off as if it's not some part of this sick game they're playing. </p>
<p>Edited to add more names. Will continue to append as I see other name anomalies. </p></p>

        <p><p>Podesta is an Italian surname going back hundreds of years. It's Italian for "magistrate." There're plenty of sources that establish John and Tony Podesta as their legal names and that they were born to a John Podesta Sr.</p>
<p>I haven't seen anything as clear cut with Alefantis, though.</p></p>

        <p><p>To me it's not a sinister coincidence.  If it is, it is.  I'm just not surprised because words reflect tonal emotional values.  If James Alefantis is his legitimate name determined by his parents, the coincidence can imply a thread in the parental psyche that disseminated to his psyche.  The most literal example is in our culturally generic John Smith, an everyman crafter.  Jane Doe, a plain mate-able female.  Jim Carrey is a 1 man show performer that 'carries' the mood for hundreds in an auditorium.  </p></p>

        <p><p>I like your theory. But for the most part at high levels, I think people are picked for certain roles based on their name. Look at say,  Navy admirals or astronauts. But this Alefantis guy, no way that is his birth name.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, that's a literal description I was trying to delineate with a name like John Smith.  I wish I could find the article about I read a while back about how words sound like what they define, like how a seagull looks like the sound of the word.  I'm not referring to this either https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomatopoeia.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Yep, what about things like how snake starts with an s .. Mountain starts with M the shape of a mountain. Water. Wave. Loop. Or the way you mouth moves when saying "in" or "out".</p></p>

        <p><p>Coincidences happen.  James Alefantis isn't even that close to J'aime l'enfants.  Also, it's a Greek name, not a made-up name.  Maybe think of it as a synchronicity, but don't try to persuade someone with "evidence" such as this.  You'll just sound foolish.</p></p>
