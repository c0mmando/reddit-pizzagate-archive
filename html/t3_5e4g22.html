        <strong>CP laws are purposefully written in a way that makes it all but impossible for citizens to investigate and expose for fear of being prosecuted themselves.</strong>
        <p><p>Pretty clever way to get away with it for those who are in a positions of power because no one is allowed to expose it to the world other than those who are actually committing the crimes.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well, it's kind of understandable. When you think about it, people could just use "investigating" as an excuse, and how would anyone be able to prove them wrong?</p></p>

        <p><p>Not really, think about the law. "Possession" of Child Porn, is enough to be jailed for years. Possession. This means saying "Hey cops I found CP and want to show you." Guess what, you possess CP and can be jailed for it because that's how the twisted rules work.</p>
<p>SO attempting to save the proof to show to cops in enough to cause you to become charged for a crime because you possess the porn.</p></p>

        <p><p>possession in general is a fucked law.</p>
<p>If you walk by a car and the door is open. Inside there is a suitcase full of drugs, money, and guns. You stop and look at that through the open door, then continue walking.  </p>
<p>A cop see's you looking into the car. Guess what? You're were in possession of that car and it's content because it was accessible. </p></p>

<p>Charged for having a deadly weapon, why you ask? Because of the shotgun that's always in the cop cars, even tho he didn't touch it.</p></p>

        <p><p>That's not possession. Possession is a three part test. 
1) knowledge of the property. 2) Consent to it being in a  place and 3) control over it being in a place. </p>
<p>Seeing stuff in a car is not possession any more than looking at stuff on TV is theft. Lol </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, i understand that.  I'm saying, if they changed the law to say "Well you can't possess it unless you're doing it to report it to us", then people would just claim that's what they were doing when they get caught.</p>
<p>There's no real way to allow possession of it for investigating without creating a loophole for guilty people to use.</p></p>

        <p><p>To anyone interested, I did some research and he certainly could have been guilty, but it seems like he was genuinely trying to investigate some deal that he thought was going on between Russian orphanages and British banks. He cancelled his payment right after he made it. It was stupid, and by his own admittance "insane", but I think it's likely that he's being honest. If he was actually trying to look at it, he wouldn't have cancelled his payment, right?</p></p>

        <p><p>Exactly - in any possible way I'd err on the side of ensuring we can absolutely nail the kneecaps of these cunts to the wall - at least in the sense of not giving them wiggle room.</p>
<p>Evidence, proper trial and shit, but don't give any leeway in interpretation.</p>
<p>You watch some of those groups that do "to catch a predator" - quite a few of the sickos that arrive at meetings try and come up with an excuse "I was going to warn the kid" but then admit they have brought the condoms / porn with them.</p>
<p>Goddamn. Exposing these hollywood / washington / brussels / London pedo rings is priority #1</p></p>

        <p><p>It's true. I'm linking some comments I made about a case of child ring that happened in Europa in the 90s:
https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5avcku/3_years_ago_an_anonymous_redditor_shared_his/d9o91hu/</p>
<p>In short, a private detector discovered huge amount of CP pictures which included known missing children. Instead of investigating the case, the belgian justice accused him of possession of CP and rape on minors (false allegations, like Assange). He got 4 years in prison where he nearly died because of the lack of treatment for his illnesses. he is now banned from any contact with the press.</p>

        <p><p>If you ONLY had the cropped face, sure. But someone (you?) would have to crop them, meaning that someone would have to have the original CP, which ironically is illegal to possess but mandatory to report. And we all know how inept the FBI is.</p></p>

</blockquote>
<p>I mean, this makes a certain degree of sense though. If you are on a website like twitter and happen to accidentally find CP and report it, I doubt highly that you would be arrested for it. But if you are on some shady deepweb site that only exists for the purpose of trading CP, it would be kind of difficult to justify why you were there in the first place. </p>
<p>There is a lot of data available on people getting v&amp; for various reasons. How many people on the sex offender registry are there that got arrested of a single count of viewing child pornography after having reported it to the police themselves? </p></p>

        <p><p>In the United States, 100% illegal. The mere act of viewing a pornographic image of a child is punishable by law.</p>
<p>For example: Imagine a sting operation. If someone sends you an image and you reply "wow that was hot" or even "DO NOT LOOK AT THAT, IT'S CHILD PORN" that is evidence that could potentially be used against you, because you have acknowledged viewing such materials. </p>
<p>Although the case would be thin without additional evidence, you could face 5 years prison. </p></p>

        <p><p>US Federal law has a safe harbor provision that protects people who inadvertently come into possession of or are exposed to a few images.</p>
<p>You just have to delete them immediately upon recognizing what they are.</p>
<p>The powers-that-be, rightly or wrongly, do not want individual citizens investigating this on their own.  Likely, that's because anyone caught with more than the safe harbor allows could just claim they were investigating, and have a chance at convincing a jury.</p></p>

        <p><p>depends where you live. Here(norway) its illegal to even look at drawings or text describing kids in a sexual manner, so saving CP on your HDD, editing and sharing it is such a legal black hole i wouldn't touch it with a 10 feet pole. So, don't do it. Seriously. You'll have to fry your harddrive after and it probably still won't help if they want to charge you. Doesn't matter how many proxies you're behind as the images themselves can install spyware on your pc which law enforcement will use to identify you.</p></p>

        <p><p>Not Illegal to post cropped pictures.  But if you have the files that are CP on your HDD then that is against the law.  What you need is an intermittent storage that is RAM only.  Have the files there, do the cropping. Save down the cropped images to permanent storage and then purge the temporary image that was RAM only.  There's nothing you've done for distributing and owning/having actual CP then. Depending on your state downloading the images would be an issue.  </p>
<p>Also, even if Wikileaks is compromised using a proper secure drop that is double or triple blind with transient storage for the transfer would make it unable to tie to you.  If they aren't compromised and you do this, you create a place where the Pizzagate details can go forward and force a major shutdown of a horrible CP ring that is being run by asshats. </p></p>

        <p><p>Someone smart enough (stupid enough?) could probably write up a neural network in tensorflow or something similar that is trained to recognize faces and output only the cropped face. Only the cropped pics would ever be saved to the harddrive. Although I say stupid enough because that still sounds mighty risky. I sure as shit aint doing it.</p>

        <p><p>Encrypted traffic through a VPN to VNC into a remote machine that has a VM that is purely RAM based and no HDD with all data destroyed on termination of the VM would do it.</p>

        <p><p>I was thinking this, too. Even before all this happened, I had thought about ways I could try to catch people, but it always seemed impossible to even try to help without getting caught up in it yourself.</p></p>

        <p><p>The crazy thing is that they try to tell in the US that are under 18 that are sending nudes to each other that they will be prosecuted for distributing child pornography...of themselves...to someone they want... That is like charging someone who attempted suicide by firearm, but survived with attempted murder and firearm charges and then killing them with the use of a firing squad.</p></p>

<p>Child pornography makes people go legitimately insane. They lose all sense of reason, any kind of rational thought, etc. It's why so many bad laws are wrapped up in 'protect the children'.</p></p>

        <p><p>Do not be idiot. If you have guess that it may be child porn and with this knowledge you open a link, that is a crime. If you are not anonymous, it is very easy to end up in a list after that time. Do not do something stupid.</p></p>

        <p><p>Look, you are free to do what you like. But know this;the reality is every picture you click end up on your harddrive in a cache somewhere on your harddrive. Removing things from a harddrive is next to impossible. This means that due to the law, clicking innocent links on twitter could end up with you in jail, because it automatically makes you in possesion of cp.</p>
<p>If the gov want you to stop snooping they will shut you down with possesion of cp easily. Nobody will question somebody being caught with cp on their hdd, the law is clear. If you got it you guilty. Just be careful, we dont know enough to take anything for certain right now.</p>
<p>Dont stop digging, but avoid looking at it at all costs if you dont have the proper precautions set up. Ask for help if you come across material you need verfied as illegal if you cant do it safely yourself.</p>
<p>This is huge, people are being killed over this stuff daily, take the correct precautions.</p></p>

        <p><p>You may not be on a list for looking. I looked..so scroll through my posts for descriptions...what was so horrific is that was wide open easily seen, I wasn't even signed in...and I looked at the Twitter stuff because I didn't think it could be that bad.</p>
<p>I was wrong. So if you think you have the emotional chops to see and hear that stuff go for it. If you can see that and feel nothing you need to be locked the fuck up.</p></p>

        <p><p>They're not 'purposefully' written so ordinary citizens can't investigate. It's a Police matter anyway but that doesn't stop some people looking. It kind of protects you too because if you know it's content and it's legality, you are VERY unlikely to either search for it or stumble across it AND it will scar the fuck out of your brain. I have experience and still remember from several years ago. Once seen,  it can't be unseen and I really do mean that. It is the material that'll make you feel literally crawling, dirty, physically repulsed and can lead to all sorts of questions, thoughts and depression. It's the worst of the worst and these sick cunts have twisted imaginations meaning there is material out there you couldn't even IMAGINE yourself. As I keep posting, please be safe and if you really want to help but don't want to get exposed to this, contact newspapers, the IWF (Internet watch foundation) and whoever else you think will listen. Anon, activists and get this exposed. </p></p>

<p>THIS. I hadn't seen any of the actual Pizzagate stuff...but Twittergate did me in. Literally. That something like that is easily found, and visible without even being signed into Twitter is unconscionable...I was stupid when I clicked thinking I had a responsibility to be aware and if it was on Twitter it couldn't be that bad.</p>
<p>I will never get the sounds of the screams from my head.</p></p>

        <p><p>Hope you're OK. I know what you mean. It's on social media it can't be that bad. I've not seen any but have dealt with it before. 7-8 years ago. And I still remember. What's equally as fucked up as the screams, is the children smiling because they have been conditioned to accept as normal or because they think they're making the adult happy. </p></p>

        <p><p>I saw a 5-8 year old giggling when a man spooged on his face...and he used his shirt to wipe it off...yeah, conditioning...this was public...I was not even signed into Twitter...that whole thing needs to be burnt down with fire...if they can't control it it needs to die. JAYSUS I always thought you'd have to go to chan or dark web...never...I figured twitter would be stolen pics of kids people fapping to...but no...full on child rape...sex slaves...WTF? Twitter needs to be sued.
I'm not OK, but I will be...and if any cops come to arrest me for seeing that there will be fucking twitter hell to pay.</p></p>

Literally little girls crying while getting raped. I had to throw up.  I reported the twitter accounts to my local PD, FBI, twitter and called every local news station about it. I hope to god someone does something to these sick fucks</p></p>

You'd think that with all that NSA spying on absolutely everything they'd at least do something about THIS. The Pentagon had how many people accessing KP from WORK computers????

        <p><p>Essentially, this is how they can use it as blackmail as they also control the loop in which it is flagged, you will see people or sites who get too close to the truth being carpet bombed by bots or shills posting CP.</p>
<p>Of course those behind such actions are immune, whilst an attempt is made to dox &amp; V&amp; the people being targeted, there is little avenue for someone targeted in this manner.</p>
<p>This is an entirely purposeful system, which is meant to protect those at the very top, whilst providing basically zero maneuvering against them from below.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm at the point now that I feel anyone coming here or claiming we're lying must immediately be reported to the FBI and their ISP noted. What I saw cannot be unseen, and anyone telling me that shit is OK needs to be fucking locked the hell up. I know chan is full of KP lovers...this isn't the chans and this shit is..damn it. I've lost patience with the "lie trolls"...this is serious business and that trolling shit devalues all those children being abused.</p></p>

        <p><p>So everything that this sub has come up with is true? </p>
<p>I'm serious. </p>
<p>Even when it's blatantly obvious that people here are saying things that are verifiably false, they shouldn't be called out?</p></p>

        <p><p>No clearly everything on here isn't true. There are people coming here trolling and purposely doing shit...to deflect, devalue and make the whole thing seem nuts. I think this crew is pretty good at sussing out the fakery...but ask yourself this..someone came here and pretended to have the goods and SOME PEOPLE LOOKED and they were horrible...so what kind of person uses actual horrific KP to try to derail a KP/Trafficking investigation? What the fuck kind of person does that? What that person did was NOT verifiably false and the "proof" that was looked at was deflectingly horrific...his story had to be torn apart before it could be tossed out. Are you suggesting that those sorts of things NOT be investigated?</p>
<p>That person posted KP here on purpose. You think this is normal trolling or a direct attempt to get this thing shut down? </p></p>

        <p><p>Asked and answered. That's all. If you're too slow to figure out or understand the process by which lies are sorted out then you can't be helped. And yes, people who post fake shit and keep saying there's nothing there...shit I've had assholes tell me there was nothing bad on Twitter. REALLY? IF you don't think that shit is bad...you have a problem. </p></p>

        <p><p>I think people posting lies trying to deflect this have an agenda that is not "wholesome" so yes. As for people posting trying to connect the dots, they are not willfully lying. There's a difference between sorting things out and coming here purposefully to deflect and make the pizzagate seem like lies.</p>
<p>Surely (and you've stayed with this pretty hard) you can tell the difference?</p>
<p>Things that aren't true get tossed out as they should. But they're not willfully lying like the fakers are.</p></p>

        <p><p>I had one of those. I posted a twitter account for people to report because it was still up hours after i reported it and after 5 or so people looked, verified and reported, some shill came in and said that they were all over 18 and that we were idiots. Its digusting seeing people actually try and defend this shit.</p>

        <p><p>No they aren't.  Drug possession laws prohibit citizens from trafficking heroin to work there way up to manufacturers the same way. </p>
<p>There are plenty of ways to investigate child porn without possessing or distributing. Police themselves use images of young looking people that are of age to avoid breaking the law as well. </p></p>

        <p><p>That's because it's the job of law enforcement to vet and prosecute cases of child pornography. Not barely sentient Redditors who raise alarm bells at literally <em>everything</em>. Ever heard of chain-of-custody? Of course not. There's not a lick of <em>verifiable</em> evidence produced in all the thousands of man hours you have wasted of not only your own time, but law enforcement's. You're out accusing people left and right of child abuse and that is no small matter. Extraordinary claims require <strong>extraordinary evidence</strong> and literally <strong>zero</strong> hard evidence has been produced. None. It's all ghosts and conspiracies and the highest echelons of government. Not only that, the supposed foundational evidence of this vast conspiracy (ie tip of the iceberg) is easily found to be demonstrably false with simple <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dp1lv/updated_pizzagate_summary_the_evidence_that/da6rh44/">Google searches</a>. Here's a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=crossed+ping+pong+paddles&amp;t=hs&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images">DuckDuckGo search</a> in case tEh GoOgle is tracking you.</p>
<p>From the view of a 45-year police veteran:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By definition, vigilantes disregard or abrogate the entire “rule of law” that has been so carefully constructed in this country. The civil rights of the accused, the rules of evidence, the rights against self-incrimination, search and seizure…. The whole list.</p>
<p>The right to trial by jury, the “adversarial” judicial system, the idea of “beyond a reasonable doubt”….. Again, all these things are tossed out when vigilantism rises. <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-police-officers-have-any-appreciation-for-the-work-of-vigilantes">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every time some retard comes up with a new conspiracy it ends up reinforcing itself. Token media coverage =/= validity either. If you shit in the hallway of a shared office building, eventually everyone one is going to smell it.</p>
<p>TL;DR: If you are genuinely concerned about the well being of children and not simply a new conspiracy do what law enforcement does. Do research on your own time, in private. Be critical of your own assumptions, come up with hard evidence, forward it to authorities. Do not act on people you simply <em>believe</em> are somehow involved. That's not how justice works at all.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is not a new conspiracy.  This is a continuation of a single conspiracy that comes up again and again.  The difference is that information sharing is as easy as it has ever been, and people's lives are on display through social media.  While I agree that there is a tremendous amount of confirmation bias on this sub, and that the potential for a witch-hunt is dangerous, this "viral" coverage is exposing widespread child abuse.  Whether you choose to acknowledge that child abuse is truly a problem, is your decision, but if you look at the pedo scandals in the UK, Norway (<em>yesterday, for Hood's sake</em>), and now, there are deep parallels connecting powerful people to child abuse.  Even if this thread simply puts more eyes on child abuse as a global issue, it is a good thing.</p>
<p>As an aside, your post history is an exhibition of political slant, and it is curious you would spend so much time posting/rationalizing with people, you yourself have called stupid.</p></p>

<p>Why? There's such a thing as circumstantial evidence. You don't need a body to charge a murderer with the murder. </p></p>

        <p><p>People are vehemently searching for your "smoking gun".  Until such a time, they are free to speculate, share information, and bring awareness through this sub.  If you are a rational person, surely you can see how the trajectory of this information mirrors what has been exposed in other countries after years of tireless investigation.  What kind of rational person looks for a "smoking gun" in a (week old) subreddit that they have professed is complete and utter bullshit?  That is not rational at all.</p></p>

        <p><p>Then why not self-regulate? Decry the obvious false stuff like: the symbology that literally meant nothing, the walk-in freezer which every restaurant with beer kegs and perishable food have, the curtain at the rear which every mom n pop shop has vs because fuck doors, the screaming kid that literally was just a kid screaming, the users claiming "ugh, I hate these fucking pedos" when in fact they have no grounds to call someone a criminal without proof. Rule of law means something in the United States of America, and if you are American you should damn well know that. It should be written in your mind like the Pledge of Allegiance.</p>
<p>Innocent until proven guilty. Start acting like human beings if you want to be treated like human beings.</p></p>

        <p><p>It is a stretch to be calling for "rule of law" in a public forum who's membership spans the globe, but point taken on self regulation.  There is shit posting here like there is everywhere.  It is odd that someone that clearly thinks this sub is grasping at straws is suddenly worried about its integrity...</p></p>

        <p><p>M8, it's disingenuous to say that because some people in this sub live in other countries that the rule of law is some dumb little idea that doesn't apply. A majority here are looking for evidence as means to implicate the entire liberal governance as some sort of pedo-mill.</p>
<p>As for shitposting you have the choice of being taken seriously or being taken as a joke. Guess which one the rational world will actually listen to. You can't pretend to be half-serious sometimes and totally legit others. If this is ubersecret shadow group is real, and people <em>genuinely</em> care about children's lives, you'll approach the subject in a way that outsiders and anyone with an open mind would view as prudent and meaningful. Shitposting has not become a valid form of speech outside Reddit and 4chan.</p>
<p>Could you imagine IRL: "Your honor, fuck this shit those assholes are guilty and you know it. Did you see the picture with tape on the hands? This is some next level shit" "Okay, next case please"</p></p>

        <p><p>This is a political issue for some of us &amp; they are our enemy regardless of how large the mountain of evidence becomes.</p>
<p>The mountain of evidence is increasing each day which implicates one end of the political spectrum that promotes degeneracy &amp; destruction of the nuclear family.</p>

        <p><p>Directly from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_custody">Chain of Custody Wiki</a>:</p>
<p>Criminal cases
When evidence can be used in court to convict persons of crimes, it must be handled in a scrupulously careful manner to prevent tampering or contamination. The idea behind recording the chain of custody is to establish that the alleged evidence is in fact related to the alleged crime, rather than having, for example, been “planted” fraudulently to make someone appear guilty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Establishing chain of custody is made of both a chronological and logical procedure, especially important when the evidence consists of fungible goods. In practice, this most often applies to illegal drugs which have been seized by law enforcement personnel. In such cases, the defendant at times disclaims any knowledge of possession of the controlled substance in question. Accordingly, the chain of custody documentation and testimony is presented by the prosecution to establish that the substance in evidence was in fact in the possession of the defendant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example
An example of chain of custody would be the recovery of a bloody knife <strong>at a murder scene</strong>:</p>
<p>1.) Officer Andrew collects the knife and places it into a container, then gives it to forensics technician Bill.</p>
<p>2.) Forensics technician Bill takes the knife to the lab and collects fingerprints and other evidence from the knife. Bill then gives the knife and all evidence gathered from the knife to evidence clerk Charlene.</p>
<p>3.) Charlene then stores the evidence until it is needed, documenting everyone who has accessed the original evidence (the knife, and original copies of the lifted fingerprints).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chain of custody requires that from the moment the evidence is collected, every transfer of evidence from person to person be documented and that it be provable that nobody else could have accessed that evidence. It is best to keep the number of transfers as low as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: If you happen upon a murder scene, find the murder weapon and take it to the cops, you've broken chain of custody</p></p>

        <p><p>Sorry, that strawman will never work. Everyone has opinions and many strong political ones at that. Trying to say that having opinions makes your ideas null and is elementary school logic. Of course I have bias, as do you.</p></p>

        <p><p>No, I'm suggesting that your hatred of Trump is blinding you to some bizarre things going on in connection to the DNC. I am further suggesting your hatred of Trump is the main motive for you to discount the possibility of organized child sexual abuse going on in DC. </p></p>

        <p><p>... So there is a large ring of human trafficking going on, but it is safe to say that the police are on the job? This has been going on for years. Twitter has been exposed for protecting a large group of pedos, while punishing the ones that are reporting the matter. Where are the police officials and the mainstream news? Perhaps we should report this George Stephanopoulos and Katie Couric, but they might not report the matter since they seem to be on good terms with Epstein. </p></p>

        <p><blockquote>

<p>> We have no actual evidence of "pizzagate"</p>
<p>> Human trafficking exists in the world</p>
<p>> Pizzagate must be real</p>
<p>> Therefore the cops, CIA, NSA, FBI, Interpol, are all covering it up</p>
<p>You're in a large conversation/investigation to <em>determine if</em> a thing is real, yet you treat it as if it's already a thing. Your confirmation bias has led you in a circle</p></p>

        <p><p>Are you a pedo? Why are you so concerned about people looking up information about these criminals? These people determine the direction our country goes in and have developed a god complex. So there is nothing suspicious about an email asking if a handkerchief is pizza related? Who would care about something like that? Why would they need to reply about the color of the handkerchief? </p></p>

        <p><p>Ah, so this is an ad hominem attack? I guess I can speculate that you are not a pedo? </p>
<p>You don't seem to want to explain why someone would be concerned about a pizza related handkerchief, and why someone would respond on their personal handkerchief's color. It makes no sense. It also makes no sense to be ticked off with people for wanting to investigate the matter. Unless you happen to be hired help of course.</p></p>
