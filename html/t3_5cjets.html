        <p><p>Moses could be in reference to the Founder of the Children of God church. He was a pedophile and would communicate to his followers via Mo Letters, or short for Moses. </p></p>

        <p><p>More likely just a reference to how Moses was found by the pharaohs court. </p></p>

        <p><p>Possibly, but which came first, the chicken or the egg? The Children of God church aka The Family International has its tentacles in all sorts of national and global initiatives. </p></p>

        <p><p>I get your point, but this I think is simply Christian lawmakers looking towards scriptures in a moral issue. Moses mom couldn't care for him because of the execution of infants- so she gave him away for a better future. Symbolism here is strongly in favour of a generic Christian doing something she/he thinks is morally righteous, rather then some international paedophilia ring indicating to other pedos. It wouldn't make much sense to incorporate symbolism at this stage, as it would only be the first step when kidnapping children, if it is indeed used as a procurement of children. And that these women who hand over their children probably wouldn't go there if they knew pedos were stealing children with the help of these laws. It would only make it less effective. </p>
<p>Occam's razor tells me this is just a benign Christian look towards scripture.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Maybe, but all of this stuff is hidden in plain sight. They use symbols that most people would assume is religious in nature, which we know doesn't mean that kids are safe with the clergy. If you read the Mo Letters, they seem pretty innocent, too. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah I guess, I mean I wouldn't be surprised at this point of it turned out that the senator who sponsored the first of it's kind was actually a part of it all. </p>
<p>I'd put it on the backrow of things, perhaps recognize that it might be important for the future, but until someone can actually implicate the senators who sponsored the bills then it's just a red herring. </p></p>

        <p><p>Wiki states the image is of a safe haven at San Fran fire station 14.</p>
<p>Any relation to the 14 Podesta drew on his hand?
Long shot?</p></p>
