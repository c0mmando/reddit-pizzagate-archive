        <p><p>There are multiple articles (MSM, even) to be found on child pornagraphy being insufficiently policed @Twitter. This is clearly the biggest scandal of the sort in the history of social media. </p>
<p>Historical precedent suggests that this ought to blow up soon enough, but who knows? So many extremely powerful people are tied up in this...</p>
<p>EDIT: Could someone with a Twitter account inform Mr Barfe (the author of the linked article) @LFBarfe and ask him to look into this? Since he wrote about it before, he might be willing to reach out again.</p></p>

        <p><p>Of course. Just wanted to show that this story has been circulating before, so if it doesn't get picked up now, something is seriously wrong.</p>
<p>Well, very clearly a lot of stuff is seriously wrong with this whole affair, but anyhow.</p></p>
