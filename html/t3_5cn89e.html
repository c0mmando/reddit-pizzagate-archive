        <strong>Anyone know what/who 'DJD'/'DJ' could be an acronym for?</strong>
        <p><p>In this image - https://i.sli.mg/qY2eog.png someone comments 'WWDJD' I imagine it is 'What would DJ do?' Can't think of any people off the top of my head. I figure it could be important because the account responds to the person directly.</p></p>

        <p><p>The thought that came to my head is WWJD = What would Jesus do?, so WWDJD = What would dark Jesus do? Just a guess, these people somehow try to rationalize their behavior in any way possible.</p></p>

        <p><p>Ok not sure if this is a lead or not, but Derek Jeter came up (What Would Derek Jeter Do). He's a former Baseball player. Now runs a website aimed at getting children into sport - Weplay: http://www.weplay.com/</p>
<p>I might be off-piste here?</p></p>

        <p><p>I got there from this VERY strange page - https://livinlavidacoco.com/2014/07/06/wwdjd/</p>
<p>We have something here and it links here:</p>
<p>https://jezebel.com/little-girls-to-do-list-is-some-real-terrifying-shit-1600889883</p>
<p>Spotted this one:</p>
<p>https://livinlavidacoco.com/2015/03/09/yeah-dating-is-cool-but-have-you-ever-had-stuffed-crust-pizza/</p>
<p>Looks like riddles. No idea! Possibly used for breaking into these encrypted files? The memes? The images? </p>
<p>Just guessing. Maybe we can pass onto the guys trying to crack those files? Perhaps his posts are clues to breaking these?</p>
<p>Can we match the dates? I think the 'Little Girls To Do List' may match the date of that post. 88 weeks ago? That article is 17/6/14. Maybe to too early - but may not be relevant.</p>
<p>Also look at the reply at the bottom of the first page.</p>
<p>Pretty sure this is code here.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think of "DJ Jesús" in Lucy, Daughter of the Devil... That series had a WWIII ending... and shit like this for a plot synopsis</p>
<p>"Senator Whitehead—Lucy's intended future husband—intends to announce his candidacy for President of the United States during a human sacrifice at the annual Bohemian Grove festival, as is the custom. The Devil gets him DJ Jesús to be the sacrificed. Meanwhile, the Special Clergy, having caught wind of the festival, decide to sneak in."</p>
<p>"To keep him out of the way, the Devil secures Senator Whitehead's son, a registered sex offender named Tad, a busboy job at Tequila Sally's. While working there he becomes obsessed with Lucy. Meanwhile, DJ Jesús experiments with foodigami—origami with food—and the Devil moves other offenders around to spell things on the online sex offender registry map."</p>
<p>Foodigami sounds a lot like spiritcooking... but I havent seen these episodes in a while enough to remember the specifics. </p></p>

<p>Is this our Jimmy? When is his birthday?</p>
<p>Then I get to this (now unused Twitter): https://twitter.com/SpeidiWeb</p>
<p>Leading here:</p>
<p>http://speidiweb.com/</p>
<p>Looks like directions and instructions for pedo sites of something. This was all of the back of searching for WWDJD, so I think this has meaning, for sure.</p>
<p>But I was specifically looking for Derek Jeter references, the DJ Jesus sounds promising too, but every time we get to something crazy!</p>
<p>Is this stuff meant to Obfuscate I wonder?</p>
<p>It just seems like normal looking parents pimping out their kids of a routine basis. WTF if wrong with the world?</p></p>
