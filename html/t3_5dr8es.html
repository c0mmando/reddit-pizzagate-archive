        <strong>new info: sketchy "pet adoption" emails</strong>
        <p><p>I came across these Podesta e-mails and there is something seriously wrong here. Take a look at the adoption websites. I'm seriously crying right now because this is so real. I feel sick guys. I randomly came across a weird e-mail referencing a cat.. looked for other e-mails referencing cats. This is screwed up.</p>

<p>I'm sorry if this is formatted badly. I never post on reddit. I'm more of a lurker, but this stuff had to be shared. </p>
<p>I'm really thinking ffgw.org is something weird look at the way they describe a certain adopted pet..
"Snow white Nyssa was adopted from FFGW on June 30, 1996 (find the original Happy Tale about Nyssa and her beloved brother Meli by clicking on the "More Happy Tales" link at the bottom of this page.) In Fall of 2011, Nyssa was 18 years young and, in the past year, became totally fluent in understanding Greek.... it was the only way her doting mom Sylvia could practice the language. She still has a true Siamese scream which she uses when she first awakens from her 5-6 hour morning nap and, when mom asks her what's wrong, she goes mute – she just wanted to make her presence known.  But how she vocalizes when Sylvia is on the computer! (Sound familiar, cat people?) Nyssa has made a few concessions to the aging process, including finally accepting renal diet wet food—after initially giving it two paws down ("this is not real chicken or real turkey.. it's not real food"). And she still loves cuddles on the bed and rolling on paper (see her at right rolling on her paper with her favorite feather). Nyssa also loves to be brushed and she throws her forelegs totally behind her head and gives a big stretch, which mom calls her "beautiful girl stretch". And she does this on request!  Nyssa, you ARE a beautiful girl!!!! With sadness, we report that Nyssa joined her beloved Meli at The Rainbow Bridge on October 22, 2012--we can only imagine their delight at being together again, even as our hearts go out to their mom, Sylvia, who misses them so"

<p>Their logo.. so it doesn't exactly match the one ping pong is supposedly based on but it has the two smaller upside down hearts and two larger right side up hearts within the logo. Just a coincidence how they were linked in creepy emails, have creepy descriptions of their cats, address isn't showing them on maps, logo has the same heart size/orientation as the pedo symbol.

        <p><p>Yes, they're called door darters, and there are plenty. One of mine likes to do it (thankfully only with interior doors). I can't go to the bathroom without him running through the door in front of me. He has to help you use the toilet.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm in the same boat. Figuring you followed the link from a thread on /r/the_donald - I've fostered cats and volunteered at animal shelters taking care of cats. I agree that your statements are accurate regarding cat people. This isn't really suspicious, and that one link is just weird. I doubt cat adoption is being used in any way to facilitate the "pizza" aspect that is in question.</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree the pet adoption seems somewhat suspicious but not totally suspicious. With kittens very young they need to be bottle fed. And the beanie babies are obviously codeword for something else. We aren't trying to put the theory down at all, I believe that there are really things like this going on.</p>
<p>However that doesn't mean every lead is correct.</p></p>

        <p><p>I mean, why does the beanie baby e-mail reference that they are dog and cat friendly? They are obviously code words. I can't think of anything else they would discuss that way. Considering what this man does, it's the most logical explanation. </p></p>

        <p><p>The thing is, they don't have to use established lingo. It's just so weird that all these sketchy emails would be referencing cats in the way they are. "If you need a room for the night and can tolerate an outrageous cat that can be provided" why do all these emails reference cats in unusual ways? I guess I could see it being drugs if it wasn't for the cat and dog friendly reference and all the other weird cat references in other emails from those georgetown emails. </p></p>

        <p><p>I have to agree. I think something is really wrong and what has been found so far are some brilliant linkings, but sometimes a cat is just a cat. I have cats and crazy cat people do talk about them like this. The Beanie Babies eMail has been looked at and broken down weeks ago, and it indeed sounds like child smuggling.</p></p>

        <p><p>I just recently got my first foster cat so yes, these are cat terms. Cat people love to write about cats, my foster cat's organization wrote an essay about him on his petfinder profile. </p>
<p>I still think the first cat email can easily be code for something sinister. Let's dig deeper. </p>
<p>Replace the word CAT with GIRL. Now read the email again as if we are talking about a 2 year old toddler, or maybe a 12 year old. </p>
<p>Replace "careless owners" with "parents of a kidnapped child". They left a door open, an opportunity for their child to be taken. </p>
<p>She may be "microchipped" could be code for "they may still be looking for her" or she may still remember/miss her home. Microchipped = potential to be located. That's why she needs to be relocated immediately. </p>
<p>Kitten could be code for "new to trafficking". An experienced owner is needed to break her "kitten spirit" so she is more obedient, someone who has had a "cat" before.</p>
<p>QT could be code for a very attractive child, a CUTIE. </p>
<p>I am questioning the 2 years old and 5 pounds part...</p>
<p>I don't think a trafficker would care how much the child weighs, so 5 pounds could have to do with the price. </p>
<p>This is just my immediate perspective. I don't have any real knowledge and I am aware that it all sounds far fetched. </p></p>

        <p><p>What about all the talk about diet related to renal conditions? It's very common in actual cats from the time they are born until the time they are old. Kidney issues are one of the few things that affect all cats. </p></p>

        <p><p>I think it's just far fetched that they would talk that way normally. The beanie babies that they guys parents can't find out about are "cat and dog friendly". An "outrageous cat" in a household would rarely be an issue in a private room unless I guess it meowed loudly or something. The way he says it and the other cat references make it seem like it's code. The way the adoptions website describes its animals is unlike anything I've ever seen "she can stretch her legs behind her head on request and her mom calls it her beautiful girl pose" the address registered for the adoption place doesn't show that adoption place on maps. Another website linked to them describes the adoption circumstances very suspiciously. Specifically, you can only take them to the agencies approved vets even w emergencies and they have a care shed (something shed. Don't remember the exact word) to use for med treatment if possible. Apparently a FAQ at adoption agencies is "what if I have to leave on very short notice and can't take my cat" and the answer is that they will take care of it. What adoption agency takes care of their adopters animals and vet situations after they are adopted? I'll link that page because it's weirder in its entirety </p></p>

        <p><p>The beanie baby thing is strange, I'll give you that.</p>
<p>The rest of the cat stuff is fairly standard in animal shelter volunteer and cat people lingo. You should check some more shelters and adoption organizations and talk to some more cat people before making the assumption that no one talks like that about their cat or that we don't anthropomorphize our pets. </p>
<p>Some shelters are crazy strict. One I worked with does a background check. It can take up to six weeks before they approve your adoption. Many try to save animals from kill shelters and would rather take in an animal they adopted out and get them a new home than face the chance that it gets abandoned or sent to a kill shelter. Some people are very passionate about animal welfare and rights. Going back to the vet care thing, some shelters are probably even more strict or at least offer the services because they have vets they trust and often offer reduced rates for cost of care.</p>
<p>I really suggest checking out at least five or six shelters (not just ASPCA, but private organizations too) and talk to some actual cat people. I think you will be pleasantly surprised that this is all wild conjecture, and just e-mails about cats.</p></p>

        <p><p>Just look at the websites thoroughly and you won't come to that conclusion. I know plenty of people with cats. I've volunteered at animal shelters. Nobody would talk about A CAT putting their legs behind their head on command and calling it Mommy's beautiful girl stretch. Come on. They talk like that so pedophiles know whats going on. Its so obvious. What do you think? John podesta, powerful man with powerful friends has a million creepy emails linking to a million creepy businesses just by fucking coincidence? FUCKING COME ON. either you're not looking into it or you're one of their people. </p></p>

        <p><p>There's LITERALLY nothing to this.  Petfinder uses same exact terminology.  Think about it.  The ones writing these descriptions are overweight animal lovers In a depressing animal shelter.  They do all they can to cheer themselves up and create hope for finding homes for animals scheduled to be put down.  They have to word their ads so people feel bad and adopt.   </p></p>

        <p><p>It's suspicious because it's true. Saw this last night and had to make an account to comment. I remember reading a Youtube comment by a girl claiming she had been abused in Satanic Rituals. This involved electric shock, isolation, being put in wash cycles in a washing machine, bending limbs backwards, lots of ritual rape, getting pregnant then forced to abort the baby in a ritual cause, etc... and also one that struck me as super weird. She said they made her pretend to be a cat, and take care of a cat as if it were a human? The way they describe the cat reminded me of that comment, must be a Satanic Ritual Abuse theme where you break people down until they exhibit the behaviors of a cat. Horrifying stuff. Also don't mind the shills, their time will come. A lot of pedophiles have been walking amongst the shadows, their only strategy is to sprout misinformation to make us doubt ourselves. </p></p>

        <p><p>We can be definitive when we speak out their code. It has shown up time and time again. Go look through the symbolism files and such. With that being said however, "they are for the most part cat and dog friendly," is an utterly useless assertion for inanimate objects. There's no dispute here, or, at least, there shouldn't be. </p>
<p>Inanimate objectives aren't assigned feelings by people of sound minds - maybe children - but not full grown adults with worries such as parents finding 400 beanie babies. When their relationship with animals was mentioned, it was <em>quite</em> apparent that these "beanie babies" aren't just dolls. It's been my understanding growing up, as my mother has told me of several times that I can recall, that people collect the shit out of them. Why the hell would someone cash out on their collection because they're scared their parents will find out? </p>

Looked up https://twitter.com/lynndeanne from image. She deleted a lot of tweets. Good thing there is https://web.archive.org/web/20130818130920/https://twitter.com/LynnDeanne
Went to this website http://www.freenclearstuff.com/product-of-my-generation from one of the links on twitter.... This was deleted as well.... So here we go again </p>
<p>https://web.archive.org/web/20140217220319/http://www.freenclearstuff.com/product-of-my-generation/</p>
<p>They sure do love their butterflies. Nothing I could find on that specific page. However, </p>
<p>https://web.archive.org/web/20140206091223/http://www.freenclearstuff.com/calming-lavender-bubble-bath/</p>

<p>https://web.archive.org/web/20161110014702/https://twitter.com/darealhippstah/status/388023752887267328</p>

<p>Although to be honest I think this might be the original source of the photos.  So this guy probably just wants to be left alone.  That said make sure you start screen shotting/saving/archiving information before sharing if you think it's meaningful..</p></p>

        <p><p>This was posted on Facebook November 8th originally.  So likely people began harassing him and messaging him.</p>
<p>There is no connection to him and Pizzagate, other than the fact that Tim Mattingly is the one who stole the pic.  Tim is the one with questionable intentions, who made the sketchy email about selling beanie babies.</p></p>

        <p><p>Don't be so quick to judge. Look around at the site linked in the adoption e-mails. Symbolism in their logo, cat friendly beanie babies for sale, outrageous cats to be provided with a room for podesta, I'm going to reply to every single one of you paid-off or involved creeps trying to save your skin. This thread isn't getting taken over by you sick people. </p></p>

        <p><p>Lol. Like everyone up there said.. "The room is what can be provided dumbass, if he can tolerate their unruly cat being around. Not a """cat""" that can be provided -_-" Take your tin foil hats off and stop being ridiculous. Do I believe there's something behind pizzagate? Obviously! Do I think some of you guys are reaching too far and need to take your meds though? Absolutely. Stop diluting the real evidence with your nonsense.</p></p>

        <p><p>are you for real? why would they highlight the way the cat escaped and was caught and survived and all that shit literally sounds like they are trying to describe a teenager who tried to escape. DID YOU NOT SEE THE FUCKING BEANIE BABY THING. get the fuck out of here if you're just trying to cover up</p></p>

        <p><p>Love you too.</p>
<p>I'm a 60 year old man.</p>
<p>This shit is mind blowing to me.</p>
<p>Truly is, as another user posted, like Plato's allegory of the cave. Or more recent, being disconnected from the matrix.</p>
<p>I'm glad this got out.</p>
<p>I fear that it is much more than pedophilia, but also, cannibalism. They are eating children I'm convinced. I'm just wondering its strictly for sacrificial purposes OR for dietary reasons OR what.</p>
<p>Chances are this is several bloodlines whom have been doing this for thousands of years.</p></p>

        <p><p>Tbh I saw redditors decode it that way weeks ago and I don't remember exactly how they broke it down. But I do know that "beans" is street slang for meth, and apparently "baby" is street slang for weed. <a href="http://www.urban75.com/Drugs/drugterm.html">Source</a> </p>
<p>I'm a strong believer in uncovering this and have been since the beginning. It's just odd that someone would sell that many children at once for only 20 dollars each so I think this particular email is code word for something else.</p></p>

        <p><p>They could also have number codes? If they know how much things cost, $20 could be an obvious 20 k or something. They're not going to write these kind of e-mails so that they make sense at a glance. </p></p>

        <p><p>Beans were also slang for ecstasy back in the day, not sure if they still are but I dabbled a bit and that's one of the terms that were used.</p></p>

        <p><p>Between the use of "beans", "sassy" (sassafras), and $20 a piece I'm totally convinced that email is about ecstasy tablets. I've tried to convince the OP of this, but they aren't willing able to cope with the idea that this person isn't selling nearly 500 children.</p></p>

        <p><p>This sub is insane. I can't believe this stuff anymore. These are literally just emails about adopting a cat out. Cat people are a weird people, man. They (ninja edit: cats I mean) do walk on and destroy keyboards. In a shelter setting you are required to bottle feed some that come in.</p>
<p>Regarding the "escaped teenager" term...have you ever had a "teenager" cat?" 6months-1 year old? They can be complete hell. It's like they are so hyper and full of youthful energy that they use it to ruin a human's day by destroying toilet paper, hiding your headphones, playing with a fucking box instead of the $100 cat tree you bought for them...like what is this anymore? You guys need a ladder you reach so far. You have a very specific narrative, which I totally get trust me, but some of this is just wronggggg. </p>
<p>Not even gonna touch on my theory about crazy ass beanie baby collectors. I mean you've never heard of those people? Who just go in debt hoarding fucking 90s toys? That's super common. Check ebay.</p>
<p>I'm out, good luck not going crazy looking through all this shit.</p></p>

PEOPLE, DONT LISTEN TO THIS, THIS SUB IS FLOODED WITH THEIR PEOPLE. Cat friendly beanie babies that GOD FORBID HIS PARENTS FIND OUT ABOUT! Adoption agency w/ pedo symbol in it's logo and sexualizing it's cat descriptions. It's like you need the website to say "HI WE PARTICIPATE IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING!" to mean anything... except then even if it did it would just be fake.. lol</p></p>

        <p><p>First, that's not all I post about. I don't comment on Reddit often, like many other Redditors I assume...but, yeah, I am gonna speak up when I think somebody is about to drive themselves crazy chasing a wild idea before looking at Petfinder to see she's not the only crazy cat lady who writes up shit like that. I used to do it at both of my old animal shelter jobs. 18 year old Siamese cat in kidney failure. Who wants that? Make up some dumbass cute story about it and people eat that up. It is really all in good fun and in the hopes of getting an animal into a home. ESPECIALLY one who was abandoned as a senior pet with a noncurable disease....</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't see a code here. Siamese cats are extremely <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI74Q01ghbs">mouthy/talkative</a> and I'm sorry but did you miss the "5-6 hour morning nap" joke? You're even skipping over important parts that really cement my theory that is is just about a cat - the fact she was 18 years old and on a <a href="https://www.proplanveterinarydiets.com/products/nf-kidney-function-cat/">renal diet</a> (probably in kidney failure) and one of the emails (maybe the same one) mentioned she went to Rainbow Bridge. Not sure if you know what that is, but it's this made up happy dog heaven place. This person made it up and wrote <a href="http://rainbowsbridge.com/Poem.htm">a poem</a> about it.</p>
<p>Also, if anyone is sexualizing the description of this cat, it's totally you dude. Cats are fucking contortionists and weird and will make eye contact with you before licking themselves sometimes and if you hang around pet people long enough you will make stupid jokes about how classy or not classy they look licking their own asshole. It's just funny because they stare at you then lick their butt. It's funny because people used to worship cats and they are just asslickers. I don't know how else to explain that. It's like a meme or something. I guess an inside joke with people who have been around cats?!</p>
<p>You need to take a step back and really think about what you are accusing this person of because as somebody who worked ~5 years in animal shelters before moving onto veterinary emergency, truuuuust me, I know how people in adoption committees talk and I know how they promote pets.</p>
<p>Look at <a href="https://www.petfinder.com/pro/for-shelters/increasing-cat-adoptions/#words">this one</a>, click here and ctrl+F "looking for laps" yeah it sounds weird at face value, but you gotta think about what adopters want. It is just pet marketing basically. Who reads newspapers? Old people who chill in their chair with a newspaper. Who wants cats, who are easy to take care of and don't weigh a lot? Old...people...who need a warm buddy to sit on their lap while they read the paper.</p>
<p>Also Best Friends has a write up about teaching adopters how to handle bios for adoptable pets <a href="http://bestfriends.org/resources/pet-profiles-how-write-animal-bios-get-your-adoptables-homes">here</a>.</p>
<p>For goodness' sake I hope that helps you chill out. Maybe you should adopt a cat to help lower your blood pressure.</p>
<p>Edit: doesn't surprise me at all you're ignoring this comment :)</p></p>

        <p><p>I'd bet money that the "beanie babies" are ecstasy tablets. The pills are often referred to as "beans", and MDMA is made using safrole, a product of sassafras , hence "sassy"... Some MDMA tastes "sassier".</p>
<p>The price is also consistent with the street price of ecstasy tablets.</p></p>

        <p><p>How am I supposed to explain a code that I'm not in on? Surely, you must be willing to accept that perhaps this person isn't trying to sell 480 children via email...?</p>
<p>I'm familiar with the lingo and all I'm saying is that the one "beanie baby" email sounds a lot like drug talk. I totally think these people are indeed baby-sacrificing, pedophile perverts, but a lot of the emails I've seen seem more like drug talk than human trafficking talk.</p>
<p>Edit: after reading thru this thread and seeing your posts I really hope you're getting some restful sleep.</p></p>

This guys going to provide him a room and an outrageous cat.. that guy is selling his mostly cat &amp; dog friendly beanie babies. seems like you're obviously losing your mind.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't think we're going to find much with this either. Been recherching but there doesn't seem to be more suspicious email and this cat thing could be just about cat indeed. I didn't want to leave any potential lead but someone else will have to dig here if they want. Could be wrong though. If you find anything else, let us know</p></p>

        <p><p>It's just my opinion, you can keep digging no problem. it didnt say 'before their parent come' the person said 'my parent cant find out'
Plus, who would buy hundreds of babies? still, it's weird that an adult would want to hide something from their parent like this. If it's toys he could easily hide them and bring them anywhere else easily.</p>
<p>Also, these could be fake numbers and more code word. For exemple, beanie babie could refer to a specific ethnicity. We should dig around that washington law center</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah I guess my verbage was a little strong about being put down. Why would you say a " (She has the most adorable, stubby, little legs; her dance moves are particularly fetching!) Like many cats who have known hunger, Melody has some food issues that have left her petite, but round." They also posted 3 other pictures of the cat, and one picture is a completely different cat.</p>

        <p><p>I have a cat, but I guess I am not a crazy cat person. I have adopted a dog from the pound. Sure he will literally eat anything(including his own shit), but if you can't control the weight of an animal your bad at being an owner. To me this shouldn't be a witch hunt, and non of these assholes should be emailing or contacting them in any matter.</p>
<p>I would understand all of what your saying if there was no connection to the emails and any of this shit. Also, would your rescue group have something like this? https://web.archive.org/web/20160307155532/http://diabellalovescats.com/katz.htm</p></p>

        <p><p>I just thought heart in a heart was a pedo sign. Why would they delete everything and also isnt butterflies something to do with pedos and grooming? The one thing I hate about putting stuff on reddit/4chan is the fucking morons telling them they are pedos and spamming it to innocent people. They are also basically giving them a heads up by doxxing them..</p></p>

Azerbaijan seems to be a place that was all up in the news at the time this was published. Could be unrelated though. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yep, saw that. And we have people here only concerned with D.C. pizza joints. Little do they know D.C. isn't beholden to normal United States law and that was set up for the purpose of getting away with crimes like this. I can't possibly say "look into the Vatican's international trafficking" any louder lol</p></p>

        <p><p>Don't forget that we have found encoded messages in photos during investigation. In fact, most photos have messages encoded in them. They are easy to extract. Some even contain data files like zip files - but I wouldn't try to open them as they are likely pedo-related photos and I for one can't afford the counseling needed by looking into this too far. How do investigators cope with swimming in this shit all the time?</p>
<p>If you can find readable text in a hex editor in any of the photos, it would more closely follow what has been found accompanying other coded communications and would be the clear link and evidence to take it from highly suspect to hard evidence -- so probably worth looking at. </p></p>

        <p><p>I more or less agree.  I just keep seeing these "I'm crying right now" posts, and they strike me as phony, and I don't see any real evidence in this post.  Seems like a distraction.</p></p>
