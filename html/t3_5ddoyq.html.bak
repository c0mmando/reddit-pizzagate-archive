        <strong>Oneida Community?</strong>
        <p><p>After the Catholic Church scandal, I'm ready to believe the possibility of pizzagate. But im wondering is the Oneida Community involved in anyway.</p>
<p>According to wikipedia,</p>
<p>"Women over the age of 40 were to act as sexual "mentors" to adolescent boys, as these relationships had minimal chance of conceiving. Furthermore, these women became religious role models for the young men. Likewise, older men often introduced young women to sex. "</p>
<p>Then they went on to become multimillionaires and supposedly just abandoned their practices after being persecuted for it. But i wonder if they still practice and are somehow influencing politics with their behavior?</p></p>
