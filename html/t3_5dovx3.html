        <strong>IICSA - UK Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse</strong>
        <p><p>This is a large UK government sponsored enquiry that has seen major setbacks (Including the chairperson being replaced 4 times!).</p>
<p>https://www.iicsa.org.uk</p>
<p>This is a very good (lengthy) overview of the story so far:

<p>I'm surprised that this hasn't been mentioned much on reddit, the abnormally large number of setbacks it's seen and the people who were originally appointed as chairpeople seems really suspicious.</p></p>
