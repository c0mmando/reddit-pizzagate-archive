        <strong>"Sex magic" Does anyone know what the reality is of sex magic? Or at least what they believe it does for them?</strong>
        <p><p>I was never one to buy into supernatural things.. but I have discovered incredible things about human history that make me wonder what these people might know. Does anyone have deep knowledge of this? </p></p>

        <p><p>In short, sexual magic is all about stirring up and directing sexual energy and/or perform sexual acts in a ritualistic manner to achieve some kind of effect. Tantra is a more "established" form of sexual magic, but almost all other esoteric traditions contain very similar practices.</p>
<p>The occult reasoning behind sexual magic is closely tied to the idea that through sexuality, man is able to get in touch with the Divine, and is even able to duplicate the Divine's ability to create a new human. At the moment of conception, the gates to the "other" worlds are momentarily opened. It is at that moment, practitioners believe, that you have an "open channel" with the Divine, so any magical intentions might be projected to a "higher level" of existence, supposedly strenghtening their effects.</p>
<p>On a side note: the other significant moment at which the portals to the "other worlds" are opened occurs, of course, at the time of death. This is why sex and death are the two most important focus points of occultism.</p>
<p>Now, sex magic in itself has no moral alignment. The actual practices vary from individual to individual, and range from the darkest deeds to the noblest of aspirations. There is a huge difference between a loving couple practising sex magic to bring selflessly bring good to the world, and a depraved monster who beliefs that raping children to death will grant him tremendous wordly powers.</p></p>

        <p><p>What if people believed that these ebil acts could be used for good purposes - like war bringing peace? I'm not condoning it at all.. but I could see how people could justify anything for their own warped beliefs.</p>
<p>Like supposedly Hitler justified his actions because he was terrified of some other country developing a super race and then taking over the world. So he felt he had to do this before they did.</p></p>

        <p><p>Look into Aleister Crowley sex magick. Its an art to gain control over people. Besides to that everything is magick but most people dont realize that.  Magick is everything that can manipulate people. Wicked exsample is the Koran burning Fron terry jones that makes people frenzy and kill each other in other countries. As a normal thinking Person you see someone is burning some paper why should anybody be angry about that. Thats actual magick. But its so normal nobody realizes that anymore because its everywhere in use.</p></p>

        <p><p>Have you heard that blood from young people rejuvenates the old? I have heard claims that in satanic rituals they scare the people before they kill them because it releases adrenaline into the blood. I'm wondering if they could use that energized blood to rejuvenate themselves physically. It's also possible that legend of this was passed down over the millennia and they misinterpreted it. </p></p>

        <p><p>I played a horror game called "Amnesia" and the main focus point of the story was this use of <a href="http://amnesia.wikia.com/wiki/Vitae">"vitae"</a>  </p>
<p>"Vitae is of cosmic origin and causes the living host to burst with energy. The catalyst is produced somewhere in the brain. Although many of its properties are unknown, one of them is the ability to extend life, potentially for centuries, if consumed in large amounts. In order to procure such amounts, it must be acquired from humans. Alexander found out through torturing dogs that although animals also secrete Vitae, they do not produce it in large enough doses to be of any use (See Canis Lupus Familiaris Note). "</p>
<p>"Obtaining Vitae is a methodical and painstaking task, as torture must be inflicted in the right fashion for maximum Vitae extraction. When pain or fear is instilled in a victim, the body fills the bloodstream with Vitae, and this can result in fits of violence and brute strength if the victim is not properly restrained and terrified. After the victim is completely broken, they will no longer produce enough Vitae, as their mind has already adjusted to the torture. Thus, Alexander used an amnesia drink to make them forget about the torture, so more Vitae could be harvested. "</p>
<p>then from that wiki, i learned of the word <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/courses/alchemy/3363-the-secret-of-azoth.html">"Azoth"</a> and it has wing nut pages about it too, pretty wild read if you into that stuff</p></p>

        <p><p>Satanists worship/are slaves to their sexual organs. Satanists worship their sex organs over their minds (they view their God-given conscience as something bothersome to be discarded in order to allow a full descent into hedonism) </p>
<p>Anything that generates energy can be used for magic. All magic leads to the dark side, as explained in the Bible, though beginners will only be introduced to "white magic." Most stop at white magic because they don't have the stomach for more. But, if a person is receptive (usually they desire personal gain: money, power, fame,etc) and sees magic as a path to get what they want, they will gradually be introduced to the dark side. Advanced white magic includes using "regular" orgasms for spells. But as you get further into the dark side, Satanists like to use drugs to open the mind and allow demon possession. At some point, you will directly make an allegiance to Satan or a demonic entity, binding yourself into slavery with blood ritual. The Satanist/ Demonist will move to sacrificing animals, orgies (unnatural sex, including bestiality &amp; pedophilia), and then to using pain as a source of energy, and then mixing pain and sex, and then mixing death and sex to create large releases of energy. Usually they will only kill animals first, but then humans. They Satanists believe that sexual torture of pure beings (children and infants) to the death creates the most energy to be used for magic. Only the most vile of people would torture an innocent being to death for personal gain, power, money etc. This type of person is actually a slave to their disgusting passions &amp; demon possessions, and they lose their humanity. A human, as explained in the Bible, is made in God's image. They are meant to be caretakers of life. By becoming a destroyer of life, they become cursed &amp; vile, and lower than the lowest of animals.  The only way out is to call on YHVH, and repent.</p></p>

        <p><p>Great information thank you!</p>
<p>Do you know if people who do this get advanced information from it? Like scientific information? Also, do you know if a lot of human sacrifice like from the Mayans is tied to this or if that was just superstition?</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, scientific information can be gained from Demons. Yes, human sacrifice is demonic and the Mayan had a strong demonic religion that involved torture, blood, sacrifice, etc (all signs of Satanism)</p>
<p>The Bible explains that Satan will rule the world until the endtimes, when Christ will defeat Satan and begin his millennial rule. </p>
<p>Even if you don't believe the Bible, there is much evidence pointing to the fact that the NWO rules the world (and has ruled the world historically), and is composed of Satanists. Rothschild is the most powerful Satanist/NWO figure in the world to my knowledge, estimated to be worth 500 Trillion. </p>
<p>Since Satanists control the banks, they have a lot of cash. (Sidenote: only 4 countries have no central bank: Syria, Iran, Cuba and NKorea. This is one of the reasons were at war with Syria. Iran is taking massive cash payment bribes, and recently talks were opened with Cuba where Obama promised to give them GITMO. NKorea not interested, so Obama is trying to start war with them). </p>
<p>NWO Satanists have infiltrated high positions everywhere to push their agenda. Because of this money and power, Satanists are able to provide: money, fame, secret desires (pedophilia etc), power, etc. to people who play along. The more vile you are, the higher you go. Pedophilia (and other vile things like bestiality and snuff sex) are videotaped and kept as blackmail to keep Satanists in line. Mutual participation in vile practices/rituals and blackmail are the glue that holds the Satanic NWO together. Most people are "lower level," have no desire for existential knowledge, and live as beasts gratifying their desires. These types get their "rewards" from higher ranking Satanists for doing what their told. </p>
<p>The few who desire knowledge forbidden by God usually start communicating with demons at some point through possession and invocations. Yes, there is information you can get from the dark side, for a price. You become a slave to demons, a slave to Satan. Black magic takes a toll on the body. With enough dark spells you become cursed, vile, sick. I've never made any such deal, but I have seen people who have (look at Hillary, she is falling apart and smells rotten so that flies land on her) The problem with Satan is that he is the Father of Lies. He offers some information, but it's always tainted with lies. One of the biggest lies I've heard is that by becoming vile and destroying life, you will somehow be "reborn" into something godlike. Satanists believe in knowledge acquired by "reverse engineering" God's creation, merging technology with humans, messing around with DNA to create chimeras, etc. This is forbidden by God. Mark of the Beast is likely a microchip without which you can't buy and sell. This would be a major step in merging humans with technology, is forbidden, and is a sign of the endtimes. The truth is that by destroying and mutilating life, you are moving closer to death, to nothingness. The Bible says that such a lifestyle leads you to a life of eternal pain aka hell. </p>
<p>You can only get the Truth from God and the Holy Spirit of Truth. God himself chooses how to give this truth depending on His plan for you in this life and your faithfulness to Him. As you become dedicated to God, you also receive more Holy Spirit of Truth. God does not lie, and is a far better path to truth and knowledge. The Bible is actually the most amazing book in the world, and I am an avid reader who has read a lot. Without the Holy Spirit, it may seem foolish, but with the Holy Spirit, it is full of treasures and knowledge. You can be saved, however, without understanding all the knowledge in the Bible. In this life, you are mostly to live within his plan. He made humans to work in a certain way. One man, one woman joined in sacred matrimony, with children raised in God. (Some are called to be unmarried, but this is less common). In this life we are instructed to live within his plan, to spread the gospel, to help one another, and to remain faithful to God until death. We are promised more information when we get to heaven, and are expected not to try to get "forbidden" information that demons offer. Humans have very little power, and have to be a slave to something (God, Satan, Demons, or lower things like drugs, food, other people, vanity, fame, etc) As you become a "slave" to God, he releases you from slavery to all other things </p>
<p>The Bible promises many good things to the faithful, but knowledge is one:
1 Corinthians 13:12 
For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.</p></p>

        <p><p>It does matter. Even though most pedophiles are not into occult stuff, the important ones, like John Podesta, are. I know there's a risk of damaging the credibility of the pizzagate-scandal, but knowing what inspires the leaders of these pedophilia-rings might provide us with extra clues where to look for evidence.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's not only damaging to the credibility of the investigation, and the subreddit, but considering satanic imagery or symbolism as "clues" could spiral literal witch hunt, damaging people and businesses who deal in the occult but are not criminals. It broadens the scope of the possible wild-goose-chases without really contributing any real leads or evidence. It's fun to think about, but it could only feasibly be relevant to the conversation if we start seeing leaked photos of politicians with pentagram tattoos or naked covered in pigs' blood dancing under the full moon. If anything like that comes to light, I'll eat my gym socks- until then, the focus needs to stay narrow for any real goals to be achieved. </p></p>
