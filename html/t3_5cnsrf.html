"I came in asking to make an order, and the guy asked me 'do you want to play dominos on cheese or on pasta?'. I wasn't really sure what he meant but he kept winking at me. He said I could leave my map anywhere I wanted if I came back once they closed. I don't even have a map! hahaha. Not really sure what he meant but my slice of pepperoni pizza was alright. The workers are oddballs but the pizza is good!"</p>

"I don't remember the rules to ping pong being that I have to play in the dark,  naked with my tongue but I still had fun. The meat balls were really salty but I managed."</p>
<p>3 months 4 stars
"The pizza is nice, and they've got ping-pong tables! A lot of the time it is really noisy inside, but they've got seating outside for good weather. The beers are a little pricey."
(noisey and pricey to stray away the average customer you say?)</p>

"I ordered one hot dogg JESUS that was good"</p>

"The pizza here was some of the worst pizza I'd ever had and the employees aren't very helpful. I tried to tell them how dissatisfied I was with my pizza and that I needed a different type of pizza. All they said was that they "had pizza in the backroom" if I was "interested." Like what? Stop with the awkward winking and just give me my pizza please."</p>
<p>1 year 4 star
"Cool pizza joint with ping pong tables in the back.  Both the pizza and the wings were delicious. The chicken was tender and just fell off the bones.  The decor is definitely unique, kind of industrial. Unfortunately the prices did seem a little high, particularly the pizza.  Still its worth a try."
(pizza is strangly expensive but still worth a try hmmmm)</p>
<p>theres more but i just couldnt tread on guys their to funny #IMDEAD</p></p>

        <p><p>Any review posted recently will be joke reviews due to the pizzagate theory.</p>
<p>I've already read all the old reviews, nothing overly suspicious but I mighta missed something.</p></p>

        <p><p>I mean anyone reviewing the restaurant likely went and ate pizza and nothing more.</p></p>

        <p><p>True but there could be some hints within the reviews to suggest something fishy is going on.</p></p>
