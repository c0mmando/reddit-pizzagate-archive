        <strong>Something is strange about this email [Haiti-related]</strong>
        <p><p>So I was revisiting the Laura Silsby case.</p>
<p>Basically, right after the earthquake, 10 U.S. missionaries were arrested for attempting to kidnap 33 Haitian children without permission. Bill Clinton negotiated for the release of 9 of them. Laura Silsby served her sentence, and it was soon revealed that the band's representative attourney was Jorge Puello, a wanted child trafficker in the U.S. as well as a sex offender.</p>
<p>So I look up the emails about the case:</p>
<p>https://www.wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/689</p>
<p>Here, Muscatine Lissa forwards an email from a man named Jillian Burns, saying "This is a good suggestion from Jillian Burns in S/P....to make sure that children (and wonen) don't become targets of traffickers, as happened in Pakistan."</p>
<p>I looked through the email that was forwarded. It was a copy/paste of 3 separate articles about the Haitian earthquake. What I find strange about this, is that the contents of the article have NO suggetions on how to prevent child trafficking. </p>
<p>Rather, the only points that the 3 articles highlight are how EASY and VULNERABLE the current Haiti is to child-sex traffickers post-earthquake.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p></p>

        <p><p><strong>Information I have relevant to Laura Silsby</strong></p>
<p>Multiple e-mail accounts in the Clinton E-mails and Podesta E-mails were receiving spam or updates from the New Life Children's Refuge that Silsby operated.</p>
<p>Laura Silsby and Charisa Coulter were arrested with several children in Haiti; Huma e-mailed HRC with regular updates; Silsby represented by attorney convicted of sex trafficking; Allowed to leave the country of Haiti after being arrested there for 33 counts of trafficking children.</p>

<p>WikiLeaks e-mail discusses pricing of transporting children</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3741</p>
<p>Silsby-Gayler became associated with <strong>MyStateUSA</strong> an Idaho corporation based Meridian Idaho in 2010 [30]. <strong>MyStateUSA</strong> CEO, Claudia Bitner, founder of MySateUSA appointed Silsby-Gayler the CFO and corporate secretary in 2011(30). <strong>MyStateUSA</strong> changed its name to <strong>AlertSense</strong> . Von Hansen is now the CEO and owner. Hansen announced Sislby-Gayler is, as of, October 2015 the VP of Marketing.</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case</p>
<p><strong>What does MyStateUSA\AlertSense do?</strong> According to their own website: "AlertSense offers a highly intuitive mass notification solution that simplifies alert creation &amp; help mobilize and manage the emergency response teams."</p>
<p>They're the contractor that supplies early response cell-based equipment that a few dozen states <strong>use for their AMBER ALERT systems</strong> as well as hazardous weather and emergency preparedness update systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new system was developed by MyStateUSA, a company based in Boise, Idaho that is also involved in a 12-state pilot project with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate interoperability among public warning alert systems.</p>

        <p><p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>I didn't even know Laura Silsby was already released. At one point I thought she could have already been killed off to prevent risk of whistleblowers.</p>
<p>This could be BIG. We need to start making graphics for all these new discoveries.</p></p>

        <p><p>Her sentence was reduced from trafficking to unlawful travelling or something like that despite her being warned that she didn't have the needed  documents <em>before</em> crossing the border.<br>
Her excuse was that she thought she had all relevant documents which makes no sense because authorities warned her that she did not posess them and she tried to smuggle the children over regardless of the warning.  </p>
<p>Also think about what company would hire somebody like Silsby/Gayler with that kind of criminal history especially if that company has something to do with children going missing...  </p>
<p>It is very fishy to say the least. The whole case stinks! In the mails she is referred to as "Laura" and not Mrs. Silsby which means that Hillary and her staff are familiar with her.</p>

        <p><p>In regards to Haiti I have a thread with a lot of information as well if it helps. The information here is good though. I feel like we are so close. I agree that we need to really compile a choesive and professional document to present this entire investigations work.</p></p>

        <p><p>You noticed the news were crafted according to the reports the team gets. If you read spanish or french haitian news, you get a slightly different story (a bit more critical). Unlike the new Podesta emails, we don't see many journalists colluding, yet they do. These communications could have been done on different emails or devices.</p>
<hr>
<p>Then you read this, <strong>written on january 24 and forwarded later, totally unrelated to Silsby.</strong> It's about 2 politicians, a big volunteer mission and a small NGO owned by 2 young women:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Mr. Gov. Rendell was boarding the airplane, Ms. McCombs recalled, Mr. Altmire told her "<em>this lady from the adoption agency is trying to stop our flight and saying we're kidnapping the children.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/10620</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>And then a few days later, an almost identical narrative appears with Silsby in the media.</strong></p>
<p>All this happens while the US is being criticized harshly by the haitian people, the doctors, some army dudes and the media. Big lack of coordination. The Silsby story got all that bad attention away and even made Bama approve some support for a "tracking system" to help orphanages... Is it Alrtsense? They don't only do amber alrt. Then the orphan kidnapping rumors seem to disappear from the news, the NGO orphanages get the green light to beg for money because they are now seen as "supervised and monitored" officially.</p>
<p>Was Silsby pardoned afterward? She only got 6 months. That's something to verify. <em>I believe Silsby was only a bait. You all stopped at Silsby.</em> She is NOT the head of any network. </p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The real story there</strong> could be related to bringing back slavery and child labour on that part of the island. Haiti is now an opened work camp. The earthquake has been convenient to donators who were already trying to find a way to flatten the place to build their infrastructures without creating a civl war or moving away civilians. The sex trade is just a side business.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The number of international adoption from Haiti dropped at the earthquake year (2010).</strong> That could mean kids were not documented, or were adopted locally or placed in NGOs. If you read all the leaks from that period, you can almost entirely track those +100 kids in the few first months even though the "situation was catastrophic" and not all adopted kids were mentioned (no full list):</p>
<ul>
<li>2009: 330</li>
<li>2010: 133</li>
<li>2011: 33</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p><strong>Some quotes:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These cases generally do not involve traditional orphanages, but rather children connected to prospective adoptive parents through charities and child sponsorship programs.</p>

<p>Some interesting bits from a report done before the earthquake:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On November 12, MINUSTAH issued a public press statement confirming that peacekeepers who had served in the country were among the 50 individuals sanctioned for sexual abuse of women and minors in 2007.</p>
<p><em>The government did not register all births immediately and did not keep statistics concerning the number of births unregistered each year.</em></p>
<p>Credible and numerous NGOs reported widespread and endemic abuse at many of the country's more than 600 orphanages, the majority of which were unregistered or not licensed by the government</p>
<p>On September 16 (2009), Douglas Perlitz was arrested in the United States on suspicion of sexually abusing minors at a boys' home, which he founded and managed in Cap-Haitien. The facility closed in January.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The url in the email (worth reading): https://www.justice.gov/usao/priority-areas/victims-rights-services/services-case-united-states-v-douglas-perlitz</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From approximately 1998 through 2008, Perlitz sexually abused at least 18 of the minor children in his care. Perlitz engaged in predatory grooming techniques and abused his position as the director</p>
<p>Women from the Dominican Republic were trafficked into the country for sexual exploitation. Traffickers also used the country as a transit point for foreigners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>'Peacekper" = not always the army, can be contractors. There's leaks/files about some traffic stories.</p>

<hr>
<p>Bill and Haitian government agree on rebuilding. </p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3129</p>
<p>It will later be know that the member of the Haitian government's own private businesses got the contracts for the construction and the conflict of interest was exposed. I'm not sure the foundation was mentioned in the media though.</p>
<p>http://www.haiti-liberte.com/archives/volume5-38/Spectacular%20Corruption.asp</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>This white paper outlining the situation of the 12 Haitian children still in limbo in Pittsburgh is too darned long but HHS feels it is essential for the senior decision makers in all three Departments to appreciate the full range of players who are interested in the decisions made about the children.</p>

<p>Congrats on haiti-korea deal; this is no secret now, the korean clothing company donated to the C foundation and apparently received a free building in Haiti. They are now the biggest or one of the biggest employer. Search for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It lays out both side of the argument, including the Prime Ministers conviction that they are being robbed of desperately needed resources by a system that is bringing in commercial goods under the guise of humanitarian assistance. He once told a group of donors that in many instances the NGOs did not know that their own staffs were running smuggling rings while using them for cover.</p>
<p>Also, Haiti has more NGOs than any other country on earth, and NGOs are a huge economic force in terms of goods coming into the country for their programs and personal use...</p>

<p>Then there’s that Torres fake lawyer who was actually wanted in El Salavador and Canada for human trafficking, and in USA for false documents. He is also known for giving false tips and lying. That guy disappeared and they found him about 3 month later but he didn't get much time. He was NOT the missionary official attorney; he appeared out of nowhere 2 days after their story went public and then disappeared.</p>

<p><strong>Also, once and for all, let's debunk the "child pricing" email:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note the date of the email above: 2001. Go check the other emails from that date.</strong> They are often attached files or files that are obviously not from 2001. If you read the wikileaks, you'll realize that email with the "prices" was downloaded by one of the Clinton's team from the church website. You can find it online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The group is called the New Life Children Refuge America Organization (NLCR). <strong>Bill Bistransky found the attached "Plan  of Action"(P0A) on their web site when he googled that name</strong>. </p>

        <p><p>People keep saying that she's a "child sex trafficker' and so and so is a known pedophile. Is there any proof of this? Could it be that she tried to smuggle those children out to get them adopted in a first world, and not actually traffic them for sex?</p>

        <p><p>Okay, but there is no proof she's a trafficker, she could very well just be trying to smuggle them out of the third world? And her attorney is a sex trafficker? How does he have his license? Again, did people just assume that by connecting the dots? What's his US sex offense? Was it a drunken hookup with a 17 year old? These things all make a difference. Extroidinary claims blah blah blah</p></p>

        <p><p>The other person (2 of 10 were charged) testified to it on the first day, if I recall correctly from another thread. I haven't confirmed this, but honestly I believe there's enough circumstantial evidence already. The other attorneys didn't want to defend her because everyone knew that she was guilty.</p>
<p>Oh, regarding the attorney you can just look up the whole case. It's all over the news, his name is Jorge something. Even Wikipedia it.</p></p>

        <p><p>So 10 people were charged, and she was one of the 10? Two of them were charged with sex trafficking? One of those charged accused her of being involved? She got away with it? Sorry, just trying to get an understanding. I hear people throw it around, but haven't actually gotten the story behind it.</p></p>
