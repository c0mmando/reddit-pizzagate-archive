        <strong>Don't think a government could hide child trafficking and abuse for decades? Watch the film Oranges and Sunshine. [UK "home children" scandal]</strong>
        <p><p>On Amazon Prime:

<p>In case you don't know the Home Children story: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8360150.stm">BBC Article</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before being shipped out to Britain's distant dominion, many of the children were told their parents were dead, and that a more abundant life awaited them in Australia.
Most were deported without the consent of their parents, and commonly, mothers and fathers were led to believe that their children had been adopted somewhere in Britain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_children</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Home Children was the child migration scheme founded by Annie MacPherson in 1869, under which more than 100,000 children were sent from the United Kingdom to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Australia apologised for its involvement in the scheme; in February 2010 UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown made a formal apology to the families of children who suffered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>EDIT: Note that this went on through the <strong>1970s</strong> and wasn't brought to light until the 1980s. Official apologies were offered 2 decades later.</p></p>
