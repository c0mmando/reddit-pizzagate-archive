        <p><p>Nicole is not a scientologist. Neither is father. So far this seems like its not connected, scientology is it's own thing focusing on drug addicts at the moment. Don't reach for connections that aren't there. </p></p>

        <p><p>Why am I a shill for wondering this? I find it hard to believe there's two deep cults in the elite ring - at some point they would be competing or converging.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think you asked a very valid question and don't think you're shilling. Scientology is involved in some messed up stuff, and they aggressively try to silence anyone questioning them. Could Scientology be connected somehow? Maybe. But it would probably be more productive to provide some evidence before asking a bunch of hypotheticals</p></p>

<p>Wiccans and Pagans are actually just normal people. You're making this sub seem like wingnuts who think Harry Potter is the devil. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yes I know they are. But many of the symbols are wiccan, so it helps to have an understanding.</p></p>

        <p><p>That's different from calling Wiccans/Pagans "bog standard sicko shit". </p>
<p>If you genuinely feel their is any occult related connections, do the research first and present your facts properly. Let me give you a hint; "wiccan/pagan" is actually lumping together a very diverse and different group of religions.</p>
<p>Wicca is a religious movement created in England in the 20th century. "Neo-Pagans" are mainly people returning or reconstructing the ancient religions of Europe (and Egypt too) (ei. Asatru (Norse Paganism), Hellenismos (Greek Paganism). None of the stuff present seems to have anything to do with the religious practices of the pre-Christian peoples of Europe. </p></p>

        <p><p>Most Roman Catholics are also normal people, but there are still a few in the system who abuse their power. It's no different here. And i'd categorise freemasons in the same bucket. A satanist is basically just a practicing athiest too - they don't worship a devil and don't belive in spirits.</p>
<p>This is bordering on the Occult. Whatever you want to label that as. There are many flavours.</p>
<p>As someone said - these peple are not Homosexual, or Hetrosexual. They're Trysexual. They'll basically TRY anything.</p></p>

        <p><p>That is fine. But please research before you make blanket statements and present your facts in a calm and logical way- and do not lump all these different religions together as one. It comes across as very ignorant and plays perfectly into the narrative of us being ignorant, redneck fundies. </p></p>

        <p><p>I think the only link would be the methods by which these organizations demand obedience.  If this shit is true Scientology is small potatoes in comparison.</p></p>

        <p><p>I wouldn't be surprised myself, but I'm not as deep into this as others. Search scientology in the sitewide wiki search and see if you can connect any dots.</p></p>
