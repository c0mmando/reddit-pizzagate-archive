        <strong>Just curious. Who here considers themselves progressive and who considers themselves conservative?</strong>
        <p><p>A few of my stances vary. I appreciate all the work those of you who are diligently looking through this unbelievable mound of evidence to point towards the guilt of some of the insanely rich elites and politicians that run the show behind the scenes towards a disgusting under age sex ring/trade. Just curious where the majority investigating this stand politically.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm extraordinarily liberal. I like the tenets of socialism, but in this day and age (as long as shit like this is going on) I suddenly agree with conservatives on just gun rights (I've never touched a gun before, but this shit scares me so much-I'm up at 3 to 5 in the morning watching). I'm not very religious in the normal sense (agnostic-ish). I liked many of the policies of Clinton, but she's a shill. I liked Bernie 100000000x more.</p></p>

        <p><p>This whole revelation has made me question my beliefs. I was a hardcore atheist but now I know there is actual true evil in this world. These 'people' are way beyond anything remotely human. </p></p>

        <p><p>No, no, man. Imo, God is in the absolute wonder and impossibility of an infinite universe of stars and strings, out of nothing. These satanism people are practicing man made "magic" retardation. It isn't real. It's all bullshit, but it has real world impacts.</p></p>

        <p><p>Conservative and I'm guessing most here are conservative since this got big in the_donald.They were the ones following the wikileaks closest trying to dig up some dirt.</p>
<p>Not that it matters, we are here to uncover this pedophile network and i assure you both liberal and conservative politicians will be implicated.</p></p>
