<strong>NYC subway murder possibily related</strong>
<p><p>She was a surrogate mother with ties to the clintons. If this is a legit surrogate', Need to find out where the kids are.</p>
<p>FBI anon posted about this lady, and there was a tweet about missing children and stolen art (can be code) on FBI twitter around same time.</p>
<p>The article seams to be missing now from CNBC but I have a screenshot</p>
<p>She was the maid for the CEO of Blackstone</p>
<p>The woman who pushed her was accused of the same crime in the past. </p>

<p><p>Surrogate mother could just be an expression to communicate that they considered her "part of the family."  I did see that it was suggested by an anon that these were connected, but I dunno.</p></p>

<p><p>True but kinda odd timing. A day where it literally gets lost in the news. Killed by a lady who did the exact same thing in the past. CEO def has ties to Clinton. Try looking them up in Wikileaks.</p></p>
