<strong>NEW! These are all of the restaurant websites linked with the IP of mybestapizza.com. ARCHIVE + DIG IN!</strong>
<p><p>Mostly pizza joints, but a few others including an Indian restaurant, a Nepalese restaurant, and an Italian restaurant.</p>
<p>I posted the names of all these websites so that people can research into who owns the establishments, where they are located, if there are any connections between the owners and other persons of interests, etc. The layout is just a minor thing - if we can find more pedo/satanic symbols that's a plus for our evidence, but it's not the main point.</p>
<p>Side note- Notice how the design for all the sites are basically the exact same as the design of www.mybestapizza.com (along with being linked to the same IP) This is massive. The same general circle of people are running a shit load of these restaurants - I want to believe that all of these places are not a part of the pedo scheme, but unfortunately it's not looking too good...</p>

<p><p>Ok, but all of these websites are connected with the same IP as Besta Pizza's website. So it's more evidence that the same group of people are running these establishments at some level. That's why we need to look into the owners of these restaurants and find more connections.</p></p>

<p><p>Wait? WTF? Okay this is interesting. How do multiple websites have the same IP? They have to be running off the same server/machine. How is each domain on the same IP?????</p>
<p>Well now there is something more. DDOS doesn't explain how site would be down because the machine running these multiple sites would be able to handle the request load.</p>
<p>Do these sites have a private section with encrypted files like Comet pizza?</p></p>

<p><p>Multiple sites on one IP is nothing special. The web server knows which site to serve you because your browser sends the domain in the request. All web server software can do this. </p></p>

<p><p>I'm not sure how to check if there are private sections. Would be a good thing for someone more tech savvy to look into. I do feel that these establishments may be more apart of the money laundering side of the scheme, but we need more evidence. This is just a start.</p></p>

<p><p>They are only connected as they all use the same app. It's like a shopify or etsy but for restaurants called ordersnapp.com. It's obvious they would be on the same server and ip.</p></p>

<p><p>You must be a shill. There's a couple there that don't use ordersnapp. And yes, obviously if it is the same people running these joints, they will probably follow a pattern of which system they use.  You don't have the authority to say the things listed in this post are not related, so quit shilling! I do agree about the children in the menu one though... that was is a huge stretch but can't be mad at people for pointing things out anyways.</p></p>

<p><p>This is a common setup of website hosting services. Simple websites that don't require sophisticated server requirements often are hosted on the same server and IP as other similar domains. The businesses get a cheaper rate and simply given bandwidth and storage limitations to ensure all sites on the server can function.</p>
<p>Also it's not uncommon to have similar sites, I.e. restaurants, grouped together because of marketing  campaigns being linked to specific resources at the host company. Also, templates and server configurations based on business types could be grouped within the hosting company.</p>
<p>That being said, for those that want to dig further into these you'd want to find out if the server is owned by a common website host or is a private server of some sort. Also if the domains are owned by the same individual or company (not a domain proxy company though as those are common add ons when purchasing hosting). Also if there are legitimate connections between these businesses that are out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>I'm interested to see where this pizza gate goes from the sidelines. There is some unsettling stuff that's been uncovered. However, I'm seeing a lot of group think, overreaching theories, and more disturbing, a witch hunt mentality that could hurt innocent people or derail the effort if the core of this is real. </p>
<p>Reddit isn't far behind 4chan in over reacting and Doxing innocent people based on little to no solid evidence. Remember the Boston marathon bombing where Reddit's over enthusiastic hunt for the terrorists ended up with an innocent college kid on the front of a news paper labeled a suspect?  Please be rational in your research and look at things objectively. Don't let confirmation bias derail yourselves. </p></p>

<p><p>Yes, I think you are referring to shared hosting vs dedicated hosting... but there are signs that show this isn't necessarily a shared hosting of unrelated businesses situation. I have a website that uses shared hosting, and when I search my IP it is very obvious that I'm on a shared server. However I don't believe that's the case we're dealing with here. Anyways, I do agree with some of your last points. Best to stay rational, but at the same time we do need to look under every 'rock' we find, even if it is seemingly innocuous at face-value (I don't believe the fact that these restaurants are all related is innocuous) but just saying.</p></p>

<p><p>On www.unclejimmyspizzeria.com if you wait at the first screen you will see "A slice of life" logo with a swirly on the 'A'</p>
<p>On www.stromboliexpress.com there is a swirl in the treble clef that appears twice front page (not much I know) but then you can see a painting on the wall that is strange and contains a number of hearts and melting imagery</p></p>

<p><p>not just melting. In that painting there is the big heart, two pedo swirls to the lower right of that. Theres also the smaller heart above that big one. </p>
<p>Also, bottom left corner "ice cream" sign. That was code used in the podesta emails.</p></p>
