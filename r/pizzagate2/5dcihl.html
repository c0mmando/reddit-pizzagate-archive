<p><p>We examined this already.</p>
<p>This is a child abuse survivor.  Her instagram has even more.  Direct, blatant pedo symbolism, direct obvious signalling.  This girl was abused and not by a stepdad or something, this girl suffered at the hands of professionals.  </p>
<p>She must have somehow gotten away or was let go, and they reblog/post her stuff maybe as a warning that they're still watching her so she can't go loud.</p></p>

<p><p>you should elaborate on how this is involved... there are some rather disturbing illustrations though, I agree</p></p>

<p><p>It's not, a large sect of Tumblr has a thing for disturbing imagery. It often has to do with DID, which likely plays a role in Pizzagate but ritual abuse and pedophilia aren't the only two things you can get it from, and even then, not all pedophiles and ritual abusers are part of the ring. I doubt that in such a common genre if Tumblr blog, every one of them is involved in Pizzagate.</p></p>

<p><p>They could be hiding in plain sight via the disturbing imagery community on Tumblr, but knowing that Tumblr is full of PTSD, DID, and other trauma-related mental illness/disorder victims, often the people who post disturbing imagery, it's more likely that many of them are victims than perpetrators.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah I think that's why they'd use it.  No one would look twice. But just LOOk at the list of accounts who reblogged this totally weird picture of a boy in snakeskin pants.</p>
<p>http://rachelchandler.tumblr.com/post/144108848847</p>
<p>You actually can't because they hid it in the CSS, but there's another thread with the full list of tumblr accounts who shared it.</p></p>

<p><p>Sorry, I was getting comments mixed. As far as I know, the only link between Chandler and her is that she gives likes to Chandler's posts. Hardly a link.</p></p>

<p><p>Actually it's even more tenuous, the account OP listed was found via a reblog from a more disturbing account that shared http://rachelchandler.tumblr.com/post/144108848847 this picture.  Let's be completely honest, this is a weird picture in the first place, even weirder that a bunch of people who post fucking weird shit would share it.  I mean does an account that posts http://nqbs.tumblr.com/post/151540900678 seem like it would share something on Rachel's blog for no reason?  There's a pattern here we just haven't figured it out yet. </p></p>

<p><p>Riddled with monarch/butterfly symbolism as well. Very interesting collection and it has an ENORMOUS number of works. This one in particular got my hairs on end. A lepidopterist, by the way, studies butterflies: http://sterility.tumblr.com/post/135258560292</p></p>

<p><p>And just for shits here's another gem: http://sterility.tumblr.com/post/133874195522/sterility-artwork-octobernovember-2015</p>
<p>Honestly a pretty damaged individual. They tend to repost the same images several times over again periodically.</p></p>
