<strong>FBI/Wikileaks - Are you with us?</strong>
<p><p>It would be good to hear or get a nod from someone that we have an organisation helping with this stuff. This started trying to link Podesta with a pedophile retaraunt and has now turned into what would be the biggest story in our livetime. </p>
<p>I beg someone from the media/FBI/Wikileaks to pick this up. There is just WAY too much to go though....</p>
<p>Some way to verify our case would be helpful - a tweak (coded?) from your twitter account possibly? Maybe PM a moderator with a code and then tweat something for us to pick up.</p>
<p>HELP is needed to coordinate all this. We are sure many eyes are on these investigations, but the press are running scared and very likely pary of the problem.</p></p>

<p><p>At the very least it is the top of the chain and numerous field agents.  You can't blame the coverup of the Franklin Scandal on just the head of the agency, because the agents actively threatened, change evidence, and generally did everything they could to make sure the victims were discredited.  Heartbreaking, but true unfortunately.</p>
<p>This is why Trump needs to drain the swamp.  It's called a swamp and not a 'pond' for a reason...</p></p>

<p><p>Snowden was almost certainly a psyop. He's been on mainstream media, and he's been wearing those same glasses with the one missing nosepiece for, what, 4 years now? ('Luminati salute yo.) You know how uncomfortable that is?</p></p>

<p><p>I can't argue with that logic.  Richard Hall also thinks he was a controlled insider.  None of what happened makes sense unless what you say is true.  Same goes for Assange.  I'm not trying to denigrate what he and his 'friends' have accomplished, but no way would Assange be breathing oxygen if he wasn't being 'protected' by certain PTB.</p></p>

<p><p>Uh, take a look at the Franklin Scandal and the FBI involvement in squelching that one.  Then come back and try again...</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is an element there, or was, that abetted these crimes. Alicia Owen was railroaded into prison, and her family personally experienced the corruption of the FBI agents involved in that scandal.  It was reprehensible reading this, and the evidence is in multiple books that are still in print and never sued.  It pretty much destroyed a lifetime belief the FBI were the 'good guys'.  And has been proven recently with the whole Comey fiasco--it hasn't changed much either.  The head of the snake is completely rancid...</p></p>

<p><p>People keep saying this and it JUST IS NOT TRUE!  Nixon was impeached, but not charged with ANY CRIMES (YET) after Watergate.</p>
<p>But Ford pardoned him 'for any crimes he may have committed while in the office of president'.  Please stop repeating lies and propaganda you've read or heard, without investigating it yourself to ensure it's correct.</p>

<p><p>That said, it would look unbelievably bad on the establishment for Obama to pardon Clinton without any charges, or pardon her at all for that matter. It's a direct admission of her guilt. It's also my understanding that a pardon can be overturned but I'm not a lawyer.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah, someone else spit in here. Did he not post a 'list' of what to look for? The inconspicuous things that have lead to bigger things.</p>
<p>And amateurish or not, it might have never been discovered if it was professional. And it may make less people believe it if it's too complicated.</p></p>

<p><p>I have lost all faith in authorities. I followed the case of Jimmy Saville and his friends in the UK. The powers be did everything to cover up for their crimes. </p></p>

<p><p>And they're still doing it!  How many committee chairmen have resigned or forced to resign in the last 3 years?  It's freaking beyond ridiculous.  They truly do think we're all stupid...I just hope it ain't true!</p>
<p>The people of Britain need to stand up and DEMAND action. Real action, because TPTB are doing everything they can to put distance between the crimes and evidence from investigators...</p></p>

<p><p>no, he said he needed plausible deniability and faced assassination if he was discovered.  It's important to be suspicious of course, but the point he kept driving home was to dig into the Clinton Foundation.  Seems like a valuable enough message regardless of whether he was legit or not. </p></p>

<p><p>Proof? Of course not.</p>
<p>But damn was he on point with a lot of shit. Even if he is full of shit, he seems smart enough that we should listen to him anyway.</p></p>
