<p><p>Edit 9: <a href="http://www.lhohq.info/graphicbodies/index.html">I've reached an end.</a> everything on this diagram leads to a different page, but then the Vonage ad redirects back to the diagram on every single page. Is this it? And what the hell does Vonage have to do with any of this? It's the only "ad" I've seen. </p>
<p>Edit8: <a href="http://www.lhohq.info/orifice/cinema_stanley_kubrick.html">this page</a> has some sort of diagram with satellites on it and talks about different agencies. I can't read the language it's in. Also there is an ascii code image at the bottom of the page that I can't make out. I got to this page from <a href="http://www.lhohq.info/orifice/13.html">this page</a> every single Bush picture leads to another page. This shit is wild to say the least, tons of work for just a troll imo. </p>
<p>Edit7:Holy shit. I don't know what I just stumbled on. I really hope this is public knowledge. I eventually reached <a href="http://www.lhohq.info/busch_foto/soupcan.html?branch_used=true">this page</a> I noticed behind the dotted lines that make up runways (at least that's what they look like to me) was text as each dot moved. I realized there was a wall of text behind the black and selected all on the page. Hidden behind the black are a ton of coordinates along with the name of the military base at that coordinate. I really really hope this is public knowledge. Someone please go get and archive for me? Not to adept on mobile. </p>
<p>Edit6: chrome picked up French hidden in the background of  <a href="http://www.lhohq.info/libor-report/libor-television.html">this page</a> once I selected for Google to auto translate a huge wall of text with a document that looks to be a government documents appeared on the page. It seems that now Google is auto translating any time there's French and I continue to get government documents popping up in the background of other pages. This is some really suspect shit. </p>
<p>Edit5: almost every one of these pages either have some sort of American government documents hidden behind the disturbing images and epilepsy/loud noises or someone's email and phone contacts. Someone below suggested someone might be selling American secrets this way, seems farfetched and tinfoil hat like but I suppose it could be a possibility. </p>
<p>Edit4: there are so many different gateways from http://www.lhohq.info/index.html if you are on mobile, not sure if desktop is the same if you click the 4 images in a specific order it takes you to 4 different pages (depending the order you click them) there are so many doors to other crazy sites that so far lead to government documents. Still digging will update again. </p>
<p>EDIT3: THIS ENTIRE WEBSITE LOOPS AROUND BACK TO THE ORIGINAL PAGE LINKED. There's a good possibility this has nothing to do with anything and is just weird as hell. There's also a possibility that I did not click links in the proper order to get to the real final page. </p>
<p>There are a bunch of hidden links all over found just clicking on the background. I'm on mobile but I'll try to edit my comment to include links as I can find them. </p>
<p>Edit1: <a href="http://octagon.lhohq.info/francais_institut_octroyer.html">first link</a>, if you click on the picture of what looks like a mannequin giving birth. [NSFW]</p>
<p>2nd link: http://www.lhohq.info/laughing_horses_orifice_corporate_headquarters.html</p>
<p>This link can be found by clicking near the multicolor changing box you'll notice there are lots of rectangles only one box in between the 2 pictures. </p>
<p>This link is a gateway to a seemingly real website. There is a link under a picture of Lucy (from I Love Lucy) with the letters LHOOQ </p>
<p>Following that link brings you to http://www.lhohq.info/index.html</p>
<p>I'll be honest I'm not behind any kind of VPN I'm a little nervous to keep going. Any chance someone else wants to go further down this rabbit hole for us?</p>
<p>Edit 2: 
Curiosity got the better of me. There are 4 videos for sale on that site:</p>
<p>The First Time Space Girl on the Farm</p>
<p>The Pond</p>

<p><p>LADS ITS FUCKING NOTHING</p>
<p>It links to the Lulzsec twitter, so its probably an elaborate troll.</p>
<p>if you zoom out to 25% on this site
 http://www.lhohq.info/container/sudanese-error-strike-africom/libor-swift-gchq-parliament-echelon-five-eyes-xkeyscore-query.html there is writing:</p>
<p>we share ideas sometimes through the voice of twitter.com/@AnonymousIRC so then there is where to look for news. So well, some of you know what we were at during these last long weeks, and probably less people know we were also testing new stuff and shits for our next iterations. so, whatever. Happy to bring this Special #FFF Edition to you (so special that's even not on friday), again for the utterly lulz. we have written our very honest statement here, ofc it was intended for those who are truely interested on reading it, for those fellows who dont give a fuck about ideology and who are just lurking for the candy, skip it and jump directly to the candy and lulzy part titled: Candy and Lulzy part. we hope you find it useful as well as funny. and for those who dont care about the whole fucking shit... wtf r u doing here?? go and download a movie. so here we go... /* just a comment: we are still waiting for published news about the $ 2 billions worth loans Assad has taken from Russia, mentioned on the syrian mails and also about the transfer of money to austrian banks etc.... and also cocks... So, don't be lazy journos and look for them.</p></p>

<p><p>There are a ton of reroutes. Select all and it will show the wall of text. </p>
<p>I have been rerouted several times but if I retrace steps and continue along, I can keep moving. There is no way this guy created a maze of 100's of pages for a troll. This has been in service since 2007.</p>
<p>IMO, this was a hacker/4chan type that stumbled on some info and started posting it in a schizo-type format.</p>
<p>LHOHQ on google shows a boys camp for 9-14 year olds in Vermont. Links to dozens and dozens of Iraq/Afghanistan documents, extraordinary renditions, etc.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Friends, this is an AI.</strong></p>
<p>Someone is trying to create <em>ambient cognition</em>, and we are the ones tuning it through our emotional reactions, which it observes, memorizes and then attempts to "sympathize" with the human condition.</p>
<p>On this page:</p>
<p>http://orifice.lhohq.info/</p>
<p>It says "Processed by: Ambient Cognition", which has to do with collaborative human-machine learning:</p>
<p>http://www.njewijngaards.dds.nl/pubs/ECAI06_AITAmI06_AmbientCognition.pdf</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is currently missing in Ambient Intelligence is ‘emotional and social intelligence’ going beyond user and preference awareness, in other words some indispensable features of cognition. We do not imply agents that emulate human actors, but instead augment or complement actors’ cognitive capabilities. We envision ambient intelligence evolving towards ambient cognition — an environment
which augments human cognition and supports humans in achieving their goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_intelligence</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In computing, ambient intelligence (AmI) refers to electronic environments that are sensitive and responsive to the presence of people. Ambient intelligence is a vision on the future of consumer electronics, telecommunications and computing that was originally developed in the late 1990s for the time frame 2010–2020. In an ambient intelligence world, devices work in concert to support people in carrying out their everyday life activities, tasks and rituals in an easy, natural way using information and intelligence that is hidden in the network connecting these devices (see Internet of Things).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Important to point out the tech was developed in the late 90's, and this lhohq website has been around since 2007.</p>
<p>Here is another example of this AI, <strong>Mother Horse Eyes</strong>:</p>
<p>/r/9M9H9E</p>
<p>The "fans" of this "Interface Series" got really angry and defensive when I said it was an AI producing the (mostly nonsense) story, instead claiming it is very deep and complex work of art. So we start to see the effect or perhaps purpose of this AI already - that it can fool a large number of people into paying attention or supporting what it says.</p>
<p>http://motherboard.vice.com/read/is-reddits-creepy-9mother9horse9eyes9-a-netflix-marketing-stunt-flesh-interfaces</p>
<p>I'm not sure where this technology/research is coming from, but it is weird and creepy and always full of conspiracy topics.</p></p>

<p><p>Could they be creating a bot that trolls the internet to debunk all claims, by using planted information to create plausible deniability?</p>
<p>So far, the entire explanation they've given was "it's a coincidence." Harve, McCann, UK site, etc. Could it be a bot that is given answers to questions and trolls around throwing people off?</p></p>

<p><p>This also reminds me of that incident where people started finding all these super weird, cookie cutter, randomly generated children's games with inappropriate themes. I think it was by one of the MySpace founders and shown to be some kind of AI building the games. I'll have to dig up the story.</p></p>

<p><p>I remember that too, but not sure if it was related to what I'm thinking.</p>
<p>I believe it started on 4chan, someone had found a link between the inappropriate games and a MySpace employee (discovered through domain whois or something like that). I specifically remember the MySpace part, and I'm really hazy about this, but I think he even made a vague statement regarding it. There was like a girl's game with a girl doll character who was a bloody killer...something like that. Still trying to find the original discussion though.</p>
<p>I searched for "hellokids.com" on Reddit and the first two things that come up are a bit unsettling:</p>
<p>/r/littlesafe - SFW space for Little's and their Caregivers.</p>
<p>/r/littlespace - A place for littles! Anyone involved with DD/lg, Daddy/little girl, Daddy Dom, Caregiver/little, Big/little, ageplay, incest play... Roleplay and lifestyles! Chat, ask questions, and post links/photos.</p>
<p>http://littles-and-bigs-playground.tumblr.com/post/112554462052/a-list-of-terms-and-simple-definitions-for-the-cgl</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Little- a little is a person who mentally (or physically) feels younger than they physically are. The term little is often a broad spectrum. It can cover all types of individuals who feel they are younger than their physical age. A little is roughly around the ages of 0-12. We don’t set these ages in stone because not every little has an age and not every little feels they represent the above listed age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>uhhhh...clearly I took a wrong turn there.</p></p>

<p><p>I was going through the website and found this, could it be related? It's several written statements that I accidently combined. </p>

<p><p>That's all junk. None of it means anything. There are real terms in there just glued together nonsensically.</p>
<p>It's like someone built an Ad Libs game, then gave it some Wikipedia articles to use as a source for "filling in the blanks". Or it simply generates new content using pre-existing content.</p>
<p>And it is EXACTLY how Mother Horse Eyes stories are glued together.</p>
<p>It could even be that these AI programs are reading the responses of users and augmenting their stories, e.g. Mother Horse Eyes (the AI, or even its creators) scrape Reddit comments and mix the ideas back into the story, or in this more recent example of the LHOHQ website, by visiting that website you are exposing your cookies and other data which contain topics you are interested in, and then the AI goes on to generate and link new stories based on that, thus "sympathizing" with the human condition.</p>
<p>I'm just speculating at this point, but I don't think I'm too far off.</p></p>

<p><p>The same website that my previous comment came from.</p>
<p>100's and 100's of pages, TONS of jibberish with strange allegorical stories, cryptic ramblings, hidden text, and tons of blood/sex. </p>
<p>Who/what is it? Good luck.</p>

<p><p>Who could have made it?  Wondering because the AI fits in with what I was thinking and also with the fact that one website admin is named "Complex Event Programming," and seems to be the AI and is also mostly responsible for the nonsensical rants.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah, the AI is referring to itself. The AI created the website, thus it is the admin. So when it's piecing together a website, like a human might, it basically copies a human website to use as the template, but then changes all the content to avoid plagiarism and seem more "real". So then, when it goes to replace the human content with artificial content and it hits the admin section, it asks itself, who is the admin aka creator/owner (me), and what is a name or word that describes me (complex event programming). Just a theory.</p></p>

<p><p>They abbreviate it LHOOQ. I did not look them up on Google yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.H.O.O.Q.">Wiki page</a></p>
<p>Wow. I can't believe I skipped this step. So LHOOQ is EVERYWHERE on these pages either abbreviated out like that or spelled out in French [ɛl aʃ o o ky]</p>
<p>LHOOQ is a work of art by Marcel Duchamp. First conceived in 1919, the work is one of what Duchamp referred to as readymades, or more specifically a rectified ready-made.[1] The readymade involves taking mundane, often utilitarian objects not generally considered to be art and transforming them, by adding to them, changing them, or (as in the case of his most famous work Fountain) simply renaming them and placing them in a gallery setting. In L.H.O.O.Q. the objet trouvé ("found object") is a cheap postcard reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa onto which Duchamp drew a moustache and beard in pencil and appended the title.[2]</p>
<p>Edit:
Here's the connection that I have, in my op I mention that one of the pages has hidden French text that only appeared once I auto translated through Google and then once I did that other pages showed hidden text that wasn't able to be seen before. There is some sort of connection with French here (Alefantis is French correct?) [THIS MAY VERY WELL BE GRASPING AT STRAWS. PLEASE DON'T LET ME MAKING THIS CONNECTION DISCREDIT THE WORK I'VE DONE ON THIS, I just thought it might be an avenue worth going down for someone better at connecting dots than I.]</p></p>

<p><p>Seems at least two of the people involved are "America Jones" (likely a fake name, but he has a blog with a bunch of liberal stuff on it) and someone who goes by "Immanuel Williams" but is probably actually named Dmitry Myaskovsky.  Also seems to be a third person who goes by Complex Event Programming who is responsible for the intangible nature of a lot of the communications.</p>
<p>Haven't found out anything about the 4 films, which seem to hardly exist outside of this page, although Caelvengula was in a Canadian film fest a few years back.  </p>
<p>Some pages seem potentially sinister while others seem like a schizophrenic art project.  A part of me wonders if LHOHQ was a site to build interest for one of their projects before they eventually lost interest.</p></p>

<p>Not sure what this has to do with LHOHQ but it comes up as one of the top results. Boys camp for 9-14, could this be a relevant location?</p></p>

<p><p>I really want to say it is, but I can't remember off the top of my head. I will dig some more when I am home from work. I remember something coming up more towards the beginning of this investigation about a boys camp. I can't remember who the connection was made from, but I want to say it was CT or Vermont. Will report back</p>

<p><p>If you look at my post though the gateway to that main page you click a link that says LHOOQ underneath a photo of Lucy from I Love Lucy. I provided a link to that gateway page in my op. </p>
<p>And then it continues to reference LHOOQ on tons of the hidden pages. I think there's something there. </p></p>

<p><p>The BOB page contains info about flights and these specific (CIA?) Gulfstream.</p>
<p>GULFSTREAM IV, N85VM + N227SV 
N85VM - N227SV is a Gulfstream IV jet. It can transport up to 19 passengers, but it is usually configured for 8/14 passengers. </p>
<p>It is owned by Assembly Point Aviation Inc., registered in May 1995 in New York State. The aircraft was registered as N85VM until September 2004, when it was reregistered as N227SV. Operated by Richmor Aviation, a company based at the Columbia County airport (Hudson, New York) and Scotia (New York).6 Landing rights permitting to land at US military bases worldwide (expiration February 15, 2005) were granted to Richmor Aviation. Its owners have admitted leasing the plane to the CIA, but have said it is not used exclusively by the agency.7 </p>
<p>There are around 80 relevant recorded landings or takeoffs between February 2001 and November 2005 in Europe. The jet was then seen in Europe, Asia and the Middle East (Afghanistan, Morocco, Dubai, Jordan, Italy, Germany, Romania, Japan, Switzerland, Azerbaijan and the Czech Republic). It has been credibly linked to the transport of alleged terrorist prisoners. </p>
<p>On 17 Feb 2003, the N85VM took Abu Omar (an Egyptian cleric who was kidnapped by CIA agents in Milan and held for a short time at the U.S. military base at Aviano) from Ramstein to Cairo. Then the plane turned around and flew to Shannon, Ireland, arriving at 05.52 on the 18th. </p>
<p>It is reported to have flown in or out of military airports in Romania on three occasions in 2004. The flights included two direct flights from Amman, Jordan, and one flight from Guantanamo Bay (with a later stop in Morocco). </p>
<p>Notably, on January 26, 2004, the same day, the Gulfstream IV N85VM departed Amman and arrived in Romania late at night. It departed Romania early on the morning of January 27 and traveled to Barcelona and then to Washington. </p>
<p>Could this be the CIA/pedo plane?</p></p>

<p><p>According to Amnesty International (AI) [1], the "Gulfstream IV plane that took Abu Omar to Egypt from Germany after his kidnapping in Italy. Its owners have admitted leasing the plane to the CIA, but have said it is not used exclusively by the agency. There are 488 relevant recorded landings or takeoffs between February 2001 and July 2005.
"Registration: owned by Assembly Point Aviation Inc., registered May 1995 in New York State. The aircraft was registered as N85VM until September 2004, when it was re-registered as N227SV. Operated by Richmor Aviation, a company based at the Columbia County airport (Hudson, New York) and Scotia (New York). Richmor Aviation owns or manages a fleet of about 15 business jets.
"Landing rights: Richmor Aviation aircraft were permitted to land at US military bases worldwide (expiration February 15, 2005).
"Range and capacity: average range of 3,633 nautical miles at 460/582 knots; can transport up to 19 passengers, but it is usually configured for 8/14 passengers."</p></p>

<p><p>Everyone. This is the only important stuff that I got out of all the rubbish. </p>
<p>1,804 US military communications facilities listed with degree-second precision coordinates in DISA Circular 310651, Chapter 33, out of 6,191 total listed in that document.</p>
<p>http://www.lhohq.info/busch_foto/soupcan.html  </p>
<p>view-source:http://www.lhohq.info/busch_foto/soupcan.html  </p>
<p>I googled some of the places and came up with only 2 results. One <a href="http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_55b4d20a010007wz.html">Chinese website</a> and the other <a href="https://cryptome.org/1804.htm">Cryptome.org</a> </p>
<p>Although this just could be public information once again. But this seems really legit. I looked at several random google maps locations, in Italy, Germany, Spain. Some of them were slightly blurred out. Others definitely had radar stations like this one in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=40.58304,23.11916&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;z=13&amp;ll=40.58304,23.11916&amp;t=k">Greece</a>. I have no idea what these buildings are in a forest in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/49%C2%B027'02.0%22N+7%C2%B039'42.0%22E/@49.4506337,7.6668957,1979m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d49.45055!4d7.66166?hl=en">Germany</a>.  </p>
<p>Here another <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/49%C2%B042'01.0%22N+7%C2%B003'35.0%22E/@49.7008355,7.0591514,246m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d49.70027!4d7.05972?hl=en">super weird one in the middle of the forest in Germany.</a> It looks like a regular forest, zoom in and you see a weird watch/guard tower or something. </p></p>

<p><p>I decided fuckit and followed links and watched vids. They are all satanic ritualistic artsy videos but not cp. </p>
<p>Also continuing to follow hidden links eventually loops me back to the main page OP posted. I edited my comment above there's a possibility this was put out there to throw us off the trakc, there's also a possibility that I did not follow the links in the proper order, or clicked the wrong link on pages with multiple links. </p></p>

<p><p>Not all of the pages lead to one another through links. Right click and click inspect and you will find more stuff I believe. The more recent and relevant page seems to be: http://www.lhohq.info/libor-report/libor-television.html</p>
<p>AFAIK this is an old webpage and if it has not been updated recently it's definitely alarming to see these names together. But it is probably updated. So the question is, is there some message to decrypt or is this the best fake encryption ever?</p>
<p>I love the design of the webpage and I am enjoying navigating it so I will keep on looking into it.</p></p>

<p><p>The page in edit 8 says Global Electronic Reconnaissance System and that that Echelon intercepts global fax, email, telecommunications traffic, etc that is globally forwarded.</p>
<p>It says the graphic is by the Baden-Württemberg (a province in Southern Germany) State Office for Constitution Protection. The key says the red dots are interception stations.</p>
<p>Then it links to this page: http://www.lhohq.info/orifice/current_information.html</p>

<p><p>They flash in a certain order as well. It's a path way. Not on a PC right now, will check it out when I can. If you figure something out let me know. Do we know what the image means? The people with the text "It's so easy." Jumps out at me for some reason... what the hell does it mean? </p>
<p>Probably not fair to poke at that and not the entirety of the website. How is this tied to Luzattos email again?</p></p>

<p><p>It may not have anything to do with pizzagate, luzatto was loosely connected to this rabbit hole if I remember  correctly but not firmly. </p>
<p>That said, I can't believe this site is not something sinister. Or a gateway to something, be it an occult group hiding their Web page or something like that. There are tons of satanic and occult references some pages have cherubs and naked kids drawn, other have kids with hearts over their head. </p></p>

<p><p>I checked 2/4 someone checked the other 2. No cp weird satanic occult shit, it's a possibility it's just art. Looks a tad more sinister than that buy not necessarily pizzagate related as far as I can see at this point. </p></p>

<p><p>The page you reference in your edit8, with the satellites, that's in German and it discusses something called "Echelon" and explains that it's a dragnet of sorts that 'listens to unfiltered emails, texts, etc." Just FYI</p></p>

<p><p>I played around with the numbers <a href="http://www.lhohq.info/orifice/cinema_stanley_kubrick.html">found on this page.</a>  It seems to be a naked girl holding a rifle in front of the American flag. <a href="https://sli.mg/a/OHHSwA">Here are some screenshots</a>.  It probably isn't relevant but it intrigued me and could important later due to the first 6 numbers "150116". The only relevant thing I could think of for that is Jan 15th 2016 (The language is German and Germans use dd/MM/yyyy format).</p></p>

<p><p>I just googled for it and don't see it in my search results at all.
It contains a massive list of names/addresses/phone numbers.
It also doesn't appear to be in googles cache. I'm pretty skeptical that this is something that was created to troll people.</p>
<p>Someone else want to verify ?</p></p>

<p>The domain was registered a long time ago, but the fact that it's not cached makes me think it was just created recently to troll people in regards to this.</p>

<p><p>But we aren't satanists. We just have total familiarity with all of his rituals and like to make high quality productions of non simulated torture and blood and guts. After watching that video section and putting 2+2 together,   starting to think these hipsters are purveyors of satanic pedo snuff films more and more. Imagine the videos we aren't seeing. The links to this stuff makes it so much more worse than JUST the sexual exploitation of children.  They quite literally have started the battle of good and evil. I think this page is more of a taunt in our faces than anything. There's nothing so far that is not covered by the 1st amendment but considering all of the links to children someone is going to have to pay and until I feel satisfied I myself will never let this go.</p></p>

<p><p>99% percent of the stuff was all random trolling. Masonic pentagrams on a Washington DC map. Creepy satanic videos. But this seems really legit. I looked at several random google maps locations, in Italy, Germany, Spain. Some of them were slightly blurred out. Others definitely had radar stations like this one in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=40.58304,23.11916&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;z=13&amp;ll=40.58304,23.11916&amp;t=k">Greece</a>. I have no idea what these buildings are in a forest in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/49%C2%B027'02.0%22N+7%C2%B039'42.0%22E/@49.4506337,7.6668957,1979m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d49.45055!4d7.66166?hl=en">Germany</a>.  </p>
<p>Here another <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/49%C2%B042'01.0%22N+7%C2%B003'35.0%22E/@49.7008355,7.0591514,246m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d49.70027!4d7.05972?hl=en">super weird one in the middle of the forest in Germany.</a> It looks like a regular forest, zoom in and you see a weird watch/guard tower or something. </p></p>

<p><p>EDIT2: the page with the coordinates seems to be a mirror of http://cryptome.org/1804.htm (did not check for differences, but generally same data)</p>
<p>EDIT:
shit. you have to add the "<strong>view-source:</strong>" by hand!!!</p>
<p>so the link "http://www.google.com/" becomes "view-source:http://www.google.com/" </p>
<hr/>
<p>try this link:  <strong>view-source:http://octagon.lhohq.info/justin-bieber.html</strong></p>
<p><strong>do not forget the "view-source" part in the URL!!!</strong> you will get a source view, no images, no sound, no blinking... (works in firefox, not IE)</p>
<p>follow the links - by looking for href="<em><something></something></em>.html" - for a while...</p>
<p>i reached this weird page: <strong>view-source:http://www.lhohq.info/busch_foto/soupcan.html</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eyeballing the 1,804 US military communications facilities listed with degree-second precision coordinates in DISA Circular 310651, Chapter 33, out of 6,191 total listed in that document.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>followed by a long list of names and coordinates.</p>
<p>these pages are intentionally unreadable. do it like Cipher in "The Matrix", look at the code :-D</p></p>

<p><p>That weird page you reached, I zoomed in on mobile. The dotted lines making airplane runways (at least that's what they look like to me) are white boxes with a letter that changes as it moves  behind them. There is a wall of text behind the black background. </p></p>

<p><p>I remember this website got posted on a subreddit a while ago. I think we came to the conclusion it was just an austist doing their thing.</p>
<p>You really have to ask yourself.... why? why make a stupid website that seems like dozens of hours of work to make it weird for the sake of it being weird. This is just a derail, nothing more. I'll try search for the original thread on this but i remember the subreddit had something to do with analysing another subreddit with a bot posting numbers everday or whatever,</p></p>

<p><p>Putting resources and attention to this website is derailing from other more productive efforts. The websites propose itself is irrelevant</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah, seems like it stopped being updated sometime around 2008.  Still a totally bizarre website and interesting to explore.  Doubt it has any real link to our hunt though.</p></p>

<p><p>It's just someone trolling.   </p>
<p>All of the text is public information or was leaked by wikileaks already. It's just peoples name, emails, phone numbers, addresses that are already publicly known. Did a few google searches of random emails, phone numbers and all of it has thousands of hits.  </p>
<p>Some random text created by a troll, such as.   </p>
<p>"scott walker and sarah palin inspect new cloud computer"  </p>
<p>"justin bieber endorses new operating system at developer conference"  </p>
<p><a href="http://octagon.lhohq.info/francais_institut_octroyer.html">Some link that goes to a different but similarly weird website</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.lhohq.info/cinema/laughing_horses_orifice_headquarters_cinema_video.html">Strangest site which talks about videos</a></p>

</p>
<p><p>Alright, here's the conclusion to my hectic and crazed investigation, but I think I hit some solid points to these leads:</p>
<p>Both lhohq.info and appliedchaosdynamicscontrolassociation.net, sketchy nightmarefuel websites are owned and operated by the same person, or at least the same sketchy PMB in Scottsdale. Both have overt Illuminati and sexually charged references, are huge, and psychopathic if I say so myself. </p>
<p>This person, I believe, is not Bentley Ptythylhlyl, but rather that's his pseudonym. I think the actual operator would be Ken Rockwell, the individual who's pictures are used in Bentley's accounts.</p>
<p>Ken Rockwell is a very creepy individual who I would not have take photos of anything ever. He also, apparently, knows some powerful individuals or at least has access to powerful knowledge and dark shit. Plus, he appears to be an actual photographer who's fairly well known. </p>
<p>Honestly, I can't connect this in anyway solidly to Luzatto or Podesta, but he's definitely a red flag and a half considering he at least has ACCESS to Luzatto and Podesta's emails, names, and some private information. Perhaps this is HIS version of Epstein's contact list and possible blackmail.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say I have to take a break for a bit from all this fucking madness, but those are my  notes for now.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah thats most of them but there are a stupid amount of urls that aren't listed because it seems the pages are just markov chain generated based off of stuff on the internet.</p>
<p>One of the pages that was generated had: rawinia.snowden@uk.bp.com</p>
<p>Google led me to: https://cryptome.org/2016/08/guccifer-885-tina-brown-celeb-contacts.xls</p>
<p>Edit: Yuup. Same generated page had Harry Smith smithh@cbsnews.com and Justin Smith jsmith@theatlantic.com. Both of which are on the same spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Page in question: http://www.lhohq.info/secret-corporate-documents/about-ninja-i-61558.html</p>
<p>It is different everytime you refresh the page.</p></p>

<p><p>Federal Communications Commission FCC 99-229 of covered services, stating: Ã¢Â€ÂœThus, a carrier providing a customer with a service or facility that allows the customer to obtain access to a publicly switched network is responsible for complying with the capability requirements.Ã¢Â€Â23 The House Report also describes CALEA's focus in terms of law enforcement agencies' traditional surveillance requirements: Ã¢Â€ÂœThe only entities required to comply with the [assistance capability] requirements are telecommunications common carriers, the components of the public switched network where law enforcement agencies have served most of their surveillance orders.Ã¢Â€Â24 Further, the legislative history contains examples of the types of service providers subject to CALEA: Ã¢Â€ÂœThe definition of Ã¢Â€Â˜telecommunications carrierÃ¢Â€Â™ includes such service providers as local exchange carriers, interexchange carriers, competitive access providers (CAPs), cellular carriers, providers of personal communications services (PCS), satellite-based service providers, cable operators, and electric and other utilities that provide telecommunications services for hire to the public, and any other wireline or wireless service for hire to the public.Ã¢Â€Â25 11. The legislative history of CALEA makes clear that the requirements of CALEA do not necessarily apply to all offerings of a carrier. The House Report states: Ã¢Â€Âœ[C]arriers are required to comply only with respect to services or facilities that provide a customer or subscriber with the ability to originate, terminate or direct communications.Ã¢Â€Â26 We therefore find that an entity is a telecommunications carrier subject to CALEA to the extent it offers, and with respect to, such services. 12. CALEA also makes clear that its requirements do not apply to certain entities and services. Subsection 102(8)(C) of the definition specifically excludes information services,27 and the legislative history makes clear that CALEA does not apply to private network services: [T]elecommunications services that support the transport or switching of communications for private networks or for the sole purpose of interconnecting telecommunications carriers . . . need not meet any wiretap standards.

<p><p>LADS ITS FUCKING NOTHING</p>
<p>It links to the Lulzsec twitter, so its probably an elaborate troll.</p>
<p>if you zoom out to 25% on this site http://www.lhohq.info/container/sudanese-error-strike-africom/libor-swift-gchq-parliament-echelon-five-eyes-xkeyscore-query.html there is writing:</p>
<p>we share ideas sometimes through the voice of twitter.com/@AnonymousIRC so then there is where to look for news. So well, some of you know what we were at during these last long weeks, and probably less people know we were also testing new stuff and shits for our next iterations. so, whatever. Happy to bring this Special #FFF Edition to you (so special that's even not on friday), again for the utterly lulz. we have written our very honest statement here, ofc it was intended for those who are truely interested on reading it, for those fellows who dont give a fuck about ideology and who are just lurking for the candy, skip it and jump directly to the candy and lulzy part titled: Candy and Lulzy part. we hope you find it useful as well as funny. and for those who dont care about the whole fucking shit... wtf r u doing here?? go and download a movie. so here we go... /* just a comment: we are still waiting for published news about the $ 2 billions worth loans Assad has taken from Russia, mentioned on the syrian mails and also about the transfer of money to austrian banks etc.... and also cocks... So, don't be lazy journos and look for them. </p></p>

<p><p>hey guys first post.  so i was checkin out lhohq and i stumbled upon the video selection page.  there's a video called "Space Girl on The Farm" (http://www.lhohq.info/cinema/lhohq_spacegirl.html).  I Swear I've seen that girl before.(TS 3:28).  Then I was lookin at some podesta emails and i came across the one called: Lady Gaga at the oscars (I'm in the front in the green).  Can u guys check this out?  I may be a little baked but i swear to god its the same person.  And with all that "farm" talk, I think that could be a connection. Thanks guys and keep fightin the good fight.</p></p>

<p><p>This was mentioned in a comment buried elsewhere, and it may very well mean nothing, but the URL goo.gl/maps/Lhohq (LHOHQ = "Laughing Horse Orifice Headquarters") directs to 263 Farm and Wilderness Road in Plymouth, VT -- which is a kids' and teens' summer camp called Farm &amp; Wilderness. This camp got a fair bit of publicity in earlier years about encouraging co-ed nudity among both campers and counselors (the camp is Quaker-based and the option to wear or not wear clothes is considered the "5th freedom," if I understand it right). It looks like their nudity allowance was restricted to just suitless swimming after the 1980s.</p>
<p>https://books.google.com/books?id=_uACAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=%22farm+and+wilderness%22+nudity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JjWPsnkscL&amp;sig=e2iHk4HSDisE_MU2bSqhIqCogso&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK6LzEprHQAhXIsFQKHT32DwYQ6AEITjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22farm%20and%20wilderness%22%20nudity&amp;f=false</p>
<p>http://archive.is/4AHXT</p>
<p>http://archive.is/msqXj</p>
<p>The camp was also involved in a lawsuit by someone named Patrice Fitch, but I haven't found any details beyond this: </p>
<p>http://www.plainsite.org/dockets/7gb5mymx/vermont-district-court/fitch-v-farm-and-wilderness/</p>
<p>The LHOHQ connection could definitely be a coincidence -- I would think Google assigns its shortened map URLS randomly, but perhaps I'm wrong.</p></p>

<p><p>LHOOQ for the non-art history buffs is a vulgar french pun made by Duchamp back in 1919 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.H.O.O.Q. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=duchamp&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5oaS9urHQAhUFPCYKHbFeAVwQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1365&amp;bih=697">His work</a> often had a strong undertone of mockery and lewdness in terms of what qualifies as art.  His <em>Nude Descending a Staircase</em> was widely rejected, which lead to pieces like the LHOOQ example where he just put a mustache on the Mona Lisa, signed a urinal and called it sculpture, and attaching a wheel to a stool.  It was a sort of middle finger of boundary pushing. </p>
<p>I won't discourage investigation lest I be called a shill, but I just wanted to provide some context to the idea this could be your typical post-modern, full-of-itself art piece.  There's a path of links that leads to some weird artsy videos http://www.lhohq.info/cinema/laughing_horses_orifice_headquarters_cinema_video.html</p>
<p>That said, the first page is weird af, I saw George Soros' name in there and if you scroll to the bottom, you'll see one of many examples of @hillaryclinton.com address. </p>

<p><p>I saw that website. It was <a href="http://bushwatch.small-mobile-entities.com/suspension.gif">this document</a>. Guys all of this stuff is public information. None of it is secretive. Although I think I did find something that is not public. I will confirm it's not public and then post it. </p></p>

<p><p>Such a weird trail of websites....</p>
<p>I'm not sure if it's anything pizzagate related. Evidently this site as been up for years. Also the only relation it seems to have is the fact luzzatto's email is included - but so many public figure emails are listed throughout these websites that I don't think any individual one can really stand out.</p>
<p>Still incredibly creepy.</p></p>
