<strong>Strongly recommend blasting the Twittergate stuff to The_Donald</strong>
<p><p>They hate twitter over there and would do a great job of getting this info out to the masses / their reliable outlets.  If it hasn't been flooded yet, should start doing it now!</p></p>

<p>This was the first thread i saw on the subject on The_Donald, it was at rising and new at first, but it disappeared from there quickly. Could be that the mods hid it, becouse there was link to 0hours tweet, which itself linked to several accounts which had CP.</p>
<p>The one on the front-page now doesnt seem to have any straight links atleast.</p></p>

<p><p>If it was compromised, about two weeks ago would have been a much more effective better time. Don't jump to conclusions - posts can be removed for any number of reasons that you perhaps might not have thought about, particularly in a situation as sensitive as this.</p></p>

<p><p>I strongly believe there was mention of the subreddit being compromised. About... two weeks ago, and more recently.</p>

<p>For the shills here. You are legitimizing our efforts. Censorship and removal will not stop us.</p>
<p>Julian helped topple governments of corruption, and you are hiding a pedo ring. This does not end on the internet, in-person conversations cannot be censored, and word is spreading faster and faster.</p></p>

<p>They're the first to sticky Hillary emails but they refuse to even touch this one, even after the current stickied posts have comment sections that are beggning the mods to sticky pizzagate and twittergate shit. I have a feeling that the sub has been compromised. </p></p>

<p><p>It's not the mods of the donald, it is the reddit admins, who have tailored algorithms specifically to target that subreddit and who enforce special rules over the mods there. Donald mods have no choice. In the past they've been personally threatened by admins and forced to apply new rules to that subreddit. For example r politics cannot be mentioned there anymore by name.</p></p>

<p><p>Yes, look at the beginning of the form, which is in blue, using Facebook.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I was thinking at the time that it said to use it.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's just saying something else.  I hate Facebook.  I do not trust that crap. My husband said to me, no, do not use it.  He is the head of my house.  I respect him.</p></p>

<p><p>I did, its at 40ish votes right now, we should all crosslink and vote brigade so it commands visibility. We need to go all out on this if we really want justice. Its clear were already being suppressed by higher ups in the media and the government, but they cannot silence the collective voice of 20,000 people making a concerted effort to flood not just reddit but every social media sphere we have available to us. </p>

<p><p>I don't expect to hear about this in the media.  But we need to get the people who have a voice to start talking about it on their podcasts / in public ect.  The media will never cover this until the are free from whatever chains have them tied into the machine (assuming they arent implicated in some way also:/ )</p></p>

<p><p>I find it strange how this 'twittergate' thing isn't hitting /r/all (nevermind the shitty mainstream media). Twitter is an online social media platform used by millions of people and no one (other than the dailystar.co.uk) is reporting thousands of CP related accounts and pictures? This is something that has tweeted tens of thousands of times on twitter over the course of this day and it's not reaching the mainstream media.</p></p>

<p><p>I will in no way defend Clinton for hanging out with this guy, and i know Clinton was way more involved with Epstein than Trump as far as we know but for any of the people who are accusing Clinton because of ties to Ep need to not be hypocrites and say Trumps relationship was fishy also. Im not saying you are one of these people.</p></p>

<p><p>plans were in place to blast #pizzagate at celeb twitters last night, now suddenly you and many other accounts are wanting #twittergate to takeover because it's untouchable. why would a shill be trying to focus on pizzagate (which has been coming together since before election night) vs "hey guys look, cp exists on the internet.. get in here" </p></p>

<p><p>Because both of them serve the same purpose.  The more pedo rings we take down the better.  This is good versus evil here.  If we come across evidence of one pedo ring while trying to solve pizzagate, it HAS to be addressed.  These are children we are talking about.</p>
<p>I suspect the two are related - but even if they aren't related, you cant in good conscience just ignore a pedophile ring simply because it isnt the solution to pizzagate - that is total madness</p></p>
