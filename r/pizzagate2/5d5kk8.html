<p><p>So instead of addressing all of the legitimate concerns and evidence, Alefantis claims we're all a bunch of right wing racists and homophobes. He's not helping his case at all because this is exactly how a guilty person tries to deflect blame.</p>
<p>If he sits down and provides rational explanations and evidence against all of the accusations, I'm willing to listen. Everybody deserves to tell their side of the story. But belittling people who are genuinely concerned about children makes me despise this guy even more.</p></p>

<p><p>I voted for Hillary. I'm not even right wing XD</p>
<p>I wanted Bernie. </p>
<p>Wtf is this bull political division shit. This transcends political views. Pizzagate consists of probably 50 50 liberals (different than dems) and conservatives.</p></p>

<p><p>its a coverup news story made to deflect the news story and make the headline readers and people who dont actually look for the truth see nothing but "oh these internet people are so crazy"</p></p>

<p><p>Awkward since they didn't care to cover it until jimmy pedo had time to wipe the place down. There is also a video from wash city paper where they go to a guy's house(frank winstead) at night and troll the shit out of him bc he reported comet ping pong as a traffic hazard for loosing ping pong balls into traffic.  an actual reporter from the paper showed up at his house at night on behalf of jimmy pedo</p></p>

<p><p>I love how Alefantis doesn't seem too concerned that there are "apparently" tunnels used by Satanists beneath his pizza parlor linking the other shops on the street. If I were him and I wasn't involved with whatever heinous crimes are/were purported to be occurring, I'd be asking the police to investigate. Maybe request they spray some Luminol around... but since he hasn't invited the cops to check things out... </p></p>

<p><p>Yeah they phrase it to make it seem like something random and crazy, so no one will look further into it.</p>
<p>Why didn't the authors mention <strong>WHY</strong> that particular phrase is of interest to "conspiracy theorists"</p>
<p>The whole article smells of BS reporting. </p></p>

<p><p>Straw man arguments to attack legitimate concerns that people have about PG.</p>
<p>There NEW attack method is to label something "alt-right" when it dose not fit their agenda.</p>
<p>The fact is that pgate has nothing to do with left or right.</p></p>
