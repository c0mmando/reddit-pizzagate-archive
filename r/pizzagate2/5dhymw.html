<strong>LISTEN UP DETECTIVES! THIS POST CONTAINS INFO THAT MAY KEEP YOU OUT OF JAIL, AND CAN HELP ORGANIZE EFFORTS!</strong>
<p><p>Alright, so there is a really nice person over in the_donald who has a law degree, and is concerned with all the stuff we are uncovering. She wrote out a lengthy post about some things we need to be aware of, and also suggested a really interesting program that we might be able to use offline to gather and organize research. I'll let her text do the talking:</p>

<p>Your research is excellent.The stuff over on /r/pizzagate
is also. After looking at a ton of it yesterday, I want to give you my "I'm a law grad but not a lawyer" speech, and then some civilian non-advice to make your research hold like cement in court while you simultaneously protect yourself going foreword. Please pass the info to the other researchers on this evidence chase. There are two things to address and set up: 1) Solid chain of evidence for the court. 2) Self defense in the event of a jackal attack on any of our researchers by the ring of criminals themselves. I am thinking it would be good to get the sites and research strings into a more formal package ready to hand over to the Trump Himself. When he cleans out the Dept of Justice and the Federal FBI, he will have hours of "head start" to give them? Also, I am a bit worried about all of the great researchers on reddit here. I don't want you to later be accused of being pedophiles yourselves because of what the photos might be leaving on your computers during the research that you might not know about. The photo of the child in the bath tub with the knife at her throat yesterday shows some of your work is getting close. So, do yourselves a favor. Prepare for that moment that one of you MIGHT happen to run into the actual cash of illegal abuse/murder/satanic ritual photos, and start now before you do. Keep records of your investigation legally sufficient to show a chain of evidence and your intent as an investigator on behalf of the children. How? 1) Starting now, keep a daily diary record of what you are doing/finding with links to the evidence pages ON YOUR COMPUTER that would be seized if they come after you. Yesterday we learned they can wipe out on line archives we make. Use a diary on your machine. Make sure this diary DOES NOT CONNECT TO THE CLOUD: This diary will also become part of the evidence chain in the case against them. With it, the pages and archives you make on the net can NOT be "dissapeared" which started happening yesterday on the chan. Also, it looks like the mods have warned us about private citizens vs public. SINCE THEY were told to tell us, that means that someone is trying to scare us and put a stop to the research where the criminals are private people. THEY KNOW FULL WELL most of this is done by private people.... so... catch 22? HELL NO. THE DIARY is the place to put that information if you think it's important. You would not be "publishing" but you would not lose your information/evidence. Here's is a DIARY for rapid download, easy to use, can also keep photos in .jpg for certain, and backs up upon request: http://www.splinterware.com/download/index.html Use the free version. It stays off the cloud. The diary alone will testify to the fact that you are a researcher, and not a pedophile, to any jury. It's time for you all to start building a situation where you prove to the prosecutor... Hey, I'm doing your job, and exactly WHAT are you going to do about all this?? Also, a screen capture of your reddit reports on line should be put in there, as you do them, showing your alert posting like the one above. With this diary of the posts and responses, your work will also protect other reddit members working on this. Please share the diary link with others. Every week, pull a copy of your research diary and evidence down OFF YOUR COMPUTER on a jump drive, and take it outside your residence perhaps safe deposit, or friend relative gun/other safe for safe keeping. If you have an officer who is a good friend, talk to him/her about starting a chain of evidence by making a copy of your work for your local police. (Make sure you get an agreement with your local police that they will take your evidence diary copies, and keep a copy yourself) If these jackals come after you or one of the others, they will most likely try to sneak a massive download of kiddie porn down on your computer then send an anonymous letter to the local police so they can brand you a pedophile. If the police know what you are doing, this move will be obvious to them, and they can get the informant lead that direction. Keep in mind,. A pedophile accusation is a jury trial offence. At best, the police will see what you are doing and be willing to help get your evidence to people who need it. At the worst, you may have to defend yourself in court. The jury will know EXACTLY whats up using the diary you have that the prosecutor could not get rid of or hide. Just trying to watch your backs. You are unbelievable and I am so grateful for your work. Start making your evidence/paper trail that cant be scrubbed, and start defending yourself and your work. IF you do, you will be fine. It may take three or four years, but you just may crack open a case bigger than the Nuremberg trials.</p>

<p>She's new, and is planning on formatting that wall into something legible for a new post on the_donald, but I figured it best to get the info here as well. I've tried the program, and it looks easy to use, it's free so accessible to people who don't use or have MS Word, and can be password protected, so your parents or kids dont wander into a minefield unexpectedly. </p>
<p>Some testing needs to be done to see if we can share a diary file directly with others, or if we can copy and paste between two seperate diaries, but we could use this to organize files offline, keep people up to date, and beat all the ridiculous censoring we are running into online. Give it a try, and post your thoughts below.</p></p>

<p><p>That's not what she's saying; she's saying make sure there are physical copies of everything and be proactive against framing attacks. </p></p>

<p><p>Exactly. It could easily be done in word. Or not, I hate using photos in word, and it doesn't auto-date edits. I don't know about password protection for word files either.</p>
<p>A lot of the info graphs floating around pol are uneditable pics as well, so it's hard for anyone to jump in and add stuff they may find relevant.</p></p>

<p><p>If you are just doing it half-assed, and wind up with something illegal on your computer, you will be expected to prove why you personally have it. Telling authorities in whatever part of the world you happen to be in that 'everybody else is doing it' is not a defense.</p></p>

<p><p>I believe she is suggesting to document the method to our madness.  Without documenting your investigative pursuit, an accuser can say you were seeking out child rings as a participant and using the "I'm investigating other people" as a cover.  Where as if you document this from start to finish you have the ability to say "I have uncovered a pedo ring and here is how..."</p></p>

<p><p>I think she has good intentions but I gotta say... I do not trust random closed source programs and I would never advise people to download and install them.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>Edit: the other advice is solid. Sorry, not trying to poopoo her efforts but people need to be careful.</p></p>
