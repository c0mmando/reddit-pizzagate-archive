<strong>One comprehensive #Pizzagate summary</strong>
<p><p>I've been on this trail since the start and there's a lot of important stuff we've all found, but there's too many summaries imo. Some of these comprehensive summaries jump into the middle of the story as well. </p>
<p>There should be one that starts from the beginning, and that beginning—imho—should start with the Podesta email with pizza party invitation attached.  That attachment led a lot of us down the rabbit hole because of the CPPP logo on it. </p>
<p>This way any lay-person can follow along just like a lot of us did in finding all this information. </p></p>

<p><p>I thought of making a video.
I thought of writing a speech.
Then I remembered, I enjoy writing.
Today I decided that I'm going to start writing an essay, titled "Why Losing the Pizza Gate Battle Signifies the Defeat of Mankind."</p>
<p>Do what you're best at in order to save these children. Some of the videos out there, by talented heroes, are fantastic. I'm sure there are more to come.</p></p>

<p><p>I've been working on something similar to this. Intended goal is something you could give your parents,grandparents, boss, teachers, etc to raise awareness and not be dismissed as a "conspiracy theorist". It's taking a lot longer than I thought it would though. I stepped on my laptop last night and that's also further complicating things.</p></p>
