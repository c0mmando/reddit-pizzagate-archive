<p><p>Eating newborn babies in satanic rituals.</p>
<p>Way more complex than just horny old pesos.</p></p>

<p><p>What evidence is there that Hilary and Bill fucking Clinton EAT BABIES in SATANIC RITUALS? I'm sorry, but you guys might be grasping at some straws. I know you're all typing "HE'S A PAID SHILL FOR THE CLINTONS", but no, I'm just someone with the ability to see this from the perspective of someone not on a witch hunt, someone who really frankly doesn't care (cause I'm Canadian).</p></p>

<p><p>I'm impressed you packed so many insults into one sentence.  Here's an idea, just say you disagree. I'm skeptical of cannibalism too, but then remember FBIanon said this stuff is not believable but still true.  Do a little research before dismissing</p></p>

<p><p>Alright, I've been reading this subreddit and the 4chan threads for the past couple of days but I'll admit I don't know everything. I'll read up on this FBIanon.</p></p>

<p><p>Horny old men and women(who happen to be running the world making us work our asses off and live in poverty) having sex with small children that they were involved in abducting? Yeah, it's very disappointing. Not sure what you're getting at.</p></p>

<p><p>You'd have to work your ass off regardless of government. If you weren't working a job, someone would still need to get you your food, your shelter, etc. That'd be YOU farming or hunting. Until robots are 100% viable as a replacement for humans in ALL jobs, you will work a job. Just find one you enjoy. </p>
<p>It is disappointing that there is no grander scheme beyond old people wanting to fuck kids. Pathetic even.</p></p>

<p>You'd be foolish to believe that. </p></p>

<p><p>I really want to discuss this without sacrificing ALL of my upvotes so I'm going to back out once my comments dip too low, but... what is the grander scheme? I have been reading this stuff for the past two days and I am very intrigued! But it seems like just a lot of loose ends.</p></p>

<p><p>Its complex and there are a lot of loosely tied leads people are working to connect, but there is also solid evidence both of pedophilia and occult involvement.</p></p>
