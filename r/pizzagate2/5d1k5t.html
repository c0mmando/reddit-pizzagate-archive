<p><p>Extremely suspicious too, Deborah Jeane Palfrey was found dead of an apparent suicide a year after this article was posted. </p>
<p>2016 Presidential Election[edit]
Sibley, Palfrey's former attorney, claims to have her phone records and that they are relevant to the 2016 presidential election.[35][36][37][38][39] In April 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the request to lift a lower court order, in place since 2007, that bars Sibley from releasing any information about her records.[40]</p>
<p>Interesting though? From her Wikipedia</p></p>

<p><p>This article seems to suggest that there are multiple pedo rings that clash with one another. Or rather, since pedorings exist at the highest level (royal family, central bankers, etc.), intelligence agencies and the like operate their own pedorings to counter them. Perhaps, Cohn, who it seems headed such a counter-pedoring (anticommunist), got sick of the fact that this garbage is not able to come to light... and well, maybe he let Trump in on the secret. </p>
<p>Someone has said that there is a link between Epstein and Trump, and I've heard that disputed. Regardless, maybe he went to little saint james and didn't like what he saw? Or maybe they never got blackmail? I dunno. Interesting to see what'll happen, so many people have been suicided over this.</p></p>
