<strong>The Palantir connection!</strong>
<p><p>This is what gives me hope. I'm starting to think that Orange mother fucker knows all about this and he wants to take it down.... where should I start?</p>
<p>Okay, so... if you're a pol/ack (meaning you're hang out on 4chan/pol a lot) you know about the Palantir. Before this whole pizzagate took off like a rocket, pol was busy trying to figure out if Trump was Batman (tongue and cheek). Why did Pol think trump was Batman? well, because of Palantir. </p>
<p>Whats this Palantir? You know Elon Musk? well, his  buddy who started Paypal with him was a gentleman named Peter Thiel. They sold paypal to ebay for a few billion and they have been doing other things since. Elon went to make spaceX and Tesla, while Peter made a few other companies most interestingly in this case Palantir technologies. </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Palantir Technologies, Inc. is a private American software and services company, specializing in big data analysis. Founded in 2004, Palantir's original clients were federal agencies of the United States Intelligence Community (USIC). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They basically make applications that allows you to take big data and make sense out of them. 
You thorough any sort of structured or unstructured data at it, any sort of data base, (sql, hadoop, fucking xls, json a goddamn notepad, what ever) and it will crunch that shit for you and allows you to make sense of TB of data. 
check out their youtube page to see how the software actually works. Mind fucking blown. </p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/user/Palantir</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/gS1IMB--3dw (very interesting video) </p>
<p>Palantir has two noteable products.  Gotham, and Metropolis ( marvel BTFO)</p>
<p>from wiki: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the USIC and United States Department of Defense, fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, and cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor (responsible for the GhostNet and the Shadow Network investigations). Palantir Metropolis is used by hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms.[3][4]</p>
<p>Palantir Gotham (formerly known as Palantir Government) integrates structured and unstructured data, provides search and discovery capabilities, knowledge management, and secure collaboration. The Palantir platform includes the privacy and civil liberties protections mandated by legal requirements such as those in the 9/11 Commission Implementation Act of 2004. Palantir’s privacy controls purportedly keep investigations focused, as opposed to the expansive data mining techniques that have drawn criticism from privacy advocates concerned about civil liberties protection. Palantir maintains security tags[further explanation needed] at a granular level.[4][13]
Palantir previously ran the site AnalyzeThe.US,[35] which allowed potential Palantir customers and affiliates to use Palantir Gotham to perform analysis on publicly available data from data.gov, usaspending.gov, the Center for Responsive Politics’ Open Secrets Database, and Community Health Data from hhs.gov.[36]</p>
<p>Palantir Metropolis (formerly known as Palantir Finance) is software for data integration, information management and quantitative analytics. The software connects to commercial, proprietary and public data sets and discovers trends, relationships and anomalies, including predictive analytics.</p>
<p>A document leaked to TechCrunch revealed that Palantir's clients as of 2013 included at least twelve groups within the US government, including the CIA, DHS, NSA, FBI, CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point, the Joint IED-defeat organization and Allies, the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board and the #National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.</p>

<p>and exhibit C</p>
<p>https://www.clintonfoundation.org/blog/2014/10/17/analyzing-and-learning-cgi-commitment-portfolio</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ten years after its founding, Palantir’s chief executive Alex (Karp) — one of the firm’s co-founders with Thiel — agreed to perform a highly sophisticated and costly feat of data analysis for the Clinton Global Initiative, at no charge.</p>
<h1>at no charge.</h1>

<p><p>Interesting, there ARE speculations that Trump is well aware of everything that is going on, I wonder what he's going to do about it once the electoral votes are given and he officially takes over.</p></p>

<p>Trump knows. He may be implicated too, which is why he didn't use it against Clinton in the race. It seems like just about everyone who's anyone took a ride on lil Jeffrey's rape plane.  </p></p>

<p><p>Palantir is similar to Analyst's Notebook, in it's function.  Palantir has a steeper learning curve than AN, but it is a lot more capable.</p>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>If you plugged in all of the unstructured data points associated with #pizzagate, it would come up with a lot of structured data, link analysis, relationships, etc.  </p>
<p>In other words, it would take the tons of memes/infographics floating around and correlate everything.  </p>
<p>If the Trump campaign had access to Gotham, and people who know how to use it (which I assume they do), plus the connections of Guiliani and LG Flynn, and they probably have known about this for a while.  And they may know more.</p>
<p>As soon as he gets the keys to the IC, then I think that's when we will start to see some movement on #pizzagate.</p></p>
