<p><p>I made this as an album and used instagram exclusively for digging. Starting from Rachel Chandler and reading comments.</p>
<p>Since she was exposed on 4chan, she's cleaned up her IG account considerably, but it appears that her friends have not.</p>
<p>Here a few interesting links that could use some more digging.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bushwickpizzaparty.com/">Bushwick Pizza Party...Not so family oriented.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://midland.agency/">MIDLAND Casting agency - run by Walter Pearce and Rachel Chandler</a></p>
<p>Could this be a human trafficking front?</p>
<p>I think these 3 individuals are former victims of the pedo ring, possibly they still participate. I think they are given huge allowances and allowed to live in depravity. Because of their deprogramming, there seems to be a constant theme of discontent and melancholy; an evil enjoyment of darkness and it persists throughout their instagram accounts. </p>
<p>I invite fellow pedes to just spend some time looking, maybe you'll make more connections than I have. <strong>Also please be smart. Don't do what the 4chan user did and make a throwaway IG account to start pointing fingers.</strong></p>

<p>In the comments, she's asked, "Is this on the farm?"</p>
<p>And she confirms that it is.</p>

<p>Could this be from the farm as mentioned here?</p>

<p><p>I've read lots of instagram stuff referencing farms and many suspicious postsers seem to own farms of some sort. Unless this is a code word again? I'm thinking this whole damn thing involves almost breeding these kids into the world of politics. Fuck knows, DNA manupulation, the super race? I'm going a bit out there on this, but why the need for SO MANY children? It doesn't makes sence. Regardless of the consiracies, there are children that need saving and people who need to go down for this.</p>
<p>I'm losing friends over this stuff. It's going to be very hard to get people to take this stuff seriously and who the hell in the media is going to cover it?</p>
<p>I'm half expecting a huge false flag cyber attack and this stuff is all going to go... :(</p>
<p>It's imperitive everything is archived away safely.</p>

<p><p>I have a theory about why they have so many kids.</p>
<p>With every kid, they run tests. Kind of like those job applications with the "personality" tests. Some kids pass, others fail. The test is there to gauge if the kid is programmable. If they pass, they are programmed and there are psychologists in their employ who conduct these test. Next, they're educated and their washing continues. What that education consists of is probably very closely guarded national or even global secrets. Master alien race, maybe.</p>
<p>If the kids fail, they are used and discarded. Some of the participants probably even prefer the "bad" kids because they can be as rough as they want. The ones who are programmed are most likely groomed into politics or, as it seems from our digging, art. Art is a perfectly viable income source for these former victims because they will have made very high profile connections, so even if their art sucks, someone <em>will</em> buy it.</p></p>

<p><p>Maybe the grow up to be the musical acts... Culkin went on to be in "underground pizza party" or something like that... Theres a bunch of girl bands with names like Childbirth, Mommy Long Legs, Girlpool, Slutever, Tacocat, Chastity Belt, mombutt, Mannequin Pussy, Lisa Prank, Hardly Boys, Bookhouse Babes, G.L.O.S.S., Wet Nurse.</p>
<p>I think Girlpool and Childbirth played at comet. </p></p>

<p><p>Music is just a form of art and most of the art that I've come across has been "performance art". Maybe not as extreme as our friend Marina A. (she kinda owns the satanic Performance Art scene), but still weird stuff.</p>
<p>Rachel Chandler is a photographer and she does have a decent eye. She's taken lots of pictures for the MARFA journal and has interviewed celebrities. Her and Walter Pearce run a "casting" firm. It's either a front for trafficking or it's a legitimate casting firm for fashion shows around the globe. There are some regular faces that appear in both of their instagram accounts. Unclear if these are subs/prostitutes that they frequently use or other victims.</p></p>

<p><p>Idk it's just a shitty site. I found an index of a bunch of food pics added 2/14 all have 3 different resolutions except for a few that have 4 and the 4th is just called food.jpeg. I looked at the source code and downloaded some of the pics but none seem to be bigger than they should. </p></p>

<p><p>WHOIS brings back GoDaddy and the owner/operator's email which is a hotmail account. If she is involved in trafficking, she's not hiding things very well.</p>
<p>I think it's just a really poorly worded intro because they have a button for all the "programs" they offer. It's also Canadian, so maybe "programming children" doesn't have the same negative connotation that it would in the US.</p>
<p>Seems like a standard daycare that just doesn't know how to market properly and/or doesn't make enough money to hire a proper marketing firm.</p></p>

<p><p>Hey man, good job here. 
Although I have to say the hoodie that says "russian mafia new world order" is just a hoodie made by a 18 year old russian model.
One of my hobbies is fashion and that hoodie I recognise as people in certain forums I frequent wanted to get one., maybe that is just a hoodie with no deeper meaning to it?</p></p>

<p><p>It's ultimately to highlight the mindset of Pearce. He's completely OK sporting a hoodie that says that. Also, if you do some digging on just general stuff and true history, the mafia has a heavy influence. Mafia had huge ties to Kennedy, for example. Of course, that's the American/Italian Mafia...</p></p>
