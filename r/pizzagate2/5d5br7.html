<p><p>What a joke. Also notice how the front page features a "cool" photo of Joe Biden-- I posted a link to this video of him clearly groping children and it was instantly removed (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd8o3WUKP8M) These fuckers are trying to hard to shut us down. </p></p>

<p><p>All the Biden stuff shook me up a bit. I thought he a cool dude until I saw how creepy he was around seeming every young woman (and woman for that matter) he is ever around.  Imagine when there are not CSPAN cameras in his face, or rather don't because I imagine he is even more aggressive and pedoweird.  </p></p>

<p><p>yeah I gave him the benefit of the doubt when I first saw that vid, and just said "oh he's just a creepy old man bombing on some meds".  But then with PizzaGate, that all changed.  And more disturbingly it will probably implicate the guy I voted twice for prez.  :-/</p></p>

<p><p>You made a choice with the information you had available at the time.  When I pushed my friend down this rabbit hole (pizzagate) his response was, "gee, guess I regret voting for Hillary."  There is a powerful media machine that has been the status quo for news for the last century, that has prompted many people to view the world through a very narrow spectrum of ideas.  The upshot of all this disgusting bullshit, is that it could very well unite people against the narrow world views that have divided us.  Thank the stars for an (almost) free internet.  </p></p>

<p><p>yes.  I told a couple people about it "generally" and how it's disgusting and dark and implicates some higher-up politicians.  But at the same time a lot of people aren't ready to even glance into that rabbit hole.  But if they ask questions, and i'm sure they will soon, I'll be there with some insight.</p></p>

<p><p>Meh, I'm under the impression that Wikileaks was compromised from the start.  Why?</p>
<p>9/11.  They never released anything.  Russia also never released anything.  Thus, wiki-leaks and Russia are complicit on some levels in 9/11.  The two most valuable pieces of credibility of the mainstream 9/11 story is that Russia would have revealed, easily, if the USA was lying about the story.  And that Wikileaks/Snowden would have revealed, or minimally talked about the fact that 9/11 was an inside job.  Instead, the three parties who you think would reveal 9/11 if it was an inside/Israeli/Saudi job, are all silent.  THIS is what keeps 9/11 under wraps.  </p>
<p>People seem to forget that Russia has been given carte blanche in Antarctica, with no opposition from the USA.  Russia and the USA have never attacked each other, and were allies in WW2.  Russia and the USA both have central banks, that are governed at the Bank of International Settlements in Switzerland.  They pretend to be enemies, but in reality, the central banks of both countries are allies, and partners that cooperate.  After WW2 they agreed to pretend to be enemies because otherwise, both countries' arms industries would have been decimated, and there would be no political reason to crack down on domestic dissent.</p>
<p>Both countries, for decades, have pretended to be at war, so that they can both crack down on domestic dissent, and spend massive amounts of taxpayer money on (largely fake)military expenditures.  In reality, both the USSR and USA did not spend as much money on weapons as they told their people.  It was a cash grab scheme, that still goes on today.  </p></p>

<p><p>To me, I can't just pass this as a misinterpretation...look at how he pulls the little asian girl's hair back and then slowly moves his hand to her breast. She looks so uncomfortable and even her friend looks over concerned. </p></p>

<p><p>A lot of the younger girls that stand with Biden look uncomfortable but is it possible we are thinking into it a bit too much? As a kid I'd be super uncomfortable if some old guy stood really close to me and put his hands on me even if he was famous and it was for a photo. I dunno. I'd love to hear from the girls themselves, maybe one that is a little older now.</p></p>

<p><p>Look man, I'm 100% in on pizzagate. I agree the girls look uncomfortable. But I was uncomfortable around strangers as a little girl too and in this particular case I'm not going to jump to a 100% conclusion that Biden rapes little girls just because he is physically awkward around them. Lots of older men are.</p></p>

<p><p>Definitely.  That's why I said that part of me wants to think this is a misinterpretation because I don't like thinking a current and soon to be former VP would do this, but it looks bad.</p></p>

<p>Take a look at this and scroll down to the bottom.  Does Barack Obama molest kids too?</p>
<p>When I saw this, I was shocked.  As much as I hate Obama and what he has done, i was shocked at the picture.  No reason someone like Biden couldn't be doing this kind of stuff. </p></p>

<p><p>My brother just sent me that link today.  Initially I was skeptical on the 'coded language' emails.  I thought they might have been referencing a money laundering scheme.  What I did know for a fact is that they were not talking about Pizza, Pasta, Maps, Hotdogs and the like.  The syntax doesn't add up.  But, when I read this link and started sourcing the material, I knew that it was evidence of a pedophilia ring.   Let's keep up the work from all angles:  keep researching, keep spreading the truth, keep counteracting the garbage corporate media.  We will prevail!  </p>
<p>Here is just one article that supports the evidence on the DC Pizza Gate Word Press site.:    http://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/</p></p>

<p><p>Just reviewed the website.  You were dead right.  The website for "Buck's" is a complete shell website.  It looks like something from 1994.  Why would a restaurant like Comet Pizza, a restaurant that has been featured on the Food Network with Guy Fieri, have another restaurant that doesn't even feel real?  The answer is simple:  hubris.  They never thought that they would get caught for their pedophilia ring, because the system was always rigged for them.  It is no coincidence that Guy Fieri came to Comet Pizza.  He came there to "normalize" it, and deflect from any investigations.  http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/diners-drive-ins-and-dives/900/farm-to-table.html</p></p>

<p><p>Ok why are people being dumb.  Of fucking course they are going to cover this stuff up.  They have a business front you think they are going to leave that stuff up?  Why are you guys surprised?  Why act like this or besta changing their logo is some sort of proof of guilt?  Any sane business would not want to be involved or brought up with pedophilia and child trafficking.  Especially if that business is actually in it.  All those posts did was give them advanced notice to remove any incriminating evidence they could and shut down besta or cosmic as a stop in the pedo underground railroad.</p>

<p><p>Agreed 100% I wish no one ever contacted them,  if anything is going on there would be more leads but now they will close ranks.  I think it's best to stop spamming them and let them think it's died down. </p></p>

<p><p>It's too late. I would imagine they're already destroying evidence. They're removing pedophile symbols from their websites, which incriminates them more, but they're dumb and they're scared. By the time Trump is sworn in most of the physical evidence will probably be gone, leaving only the data the FBI already has. Hopefully that's enough.</p></p>

<p><p>If im there, have no clue about pizzagate, and just want a free pizza, i'm probably giving them that 5 star. Look for reviewers who are also friends with alefantis first so you know they're not just innocents getting free pizza.</p></p>

<p><p>After all they run a legit business (too?), does it surprise anyone that they try to keep up their reputation? Completely unrelated from everything else, a pizza place with only a few stars will miss out on a lot of money. Dont do as if they try to cover up anything, they are just trying to survive their business...</p>

<p><p>to be fair: this is a restaurant. they make money from people coming there and buying pizza. so defending the business is an expected response. and fake reviews and free food give-aways may be frowned upon, but are not really illegal per se.</p>
<p>so let's give them the benefit of the doubt for the time being and keep digging for more evidence! noone benefits from mud-slinging false accusations.</p></p>

<p>Not surprising at all given that Alefantis is tied to David Brock who control Correct The Record.</p>
<p>But posting reviews of a business you have never been a patron of is pretty dum whether it's astroturf or soapboxing.</p></p>

<p><p>Counter attack, just make a bunch of different accounts and give them bad reviews talking about the pedophilia ring. That will run them into the ground. I'll get started.</p></p>

<p><p>Listen, I posted this elsewhere. Think about Eyes Wide Shut. When he went back the next everything was gone. I believe they cleaned up and removed whatever evidence may have been in comet. I know they are elitist pricks, but they surely are not dumb. </p>
<p>I think its time to stay ahead of the game and look elsewhere. However, if they did move shop i would think that they are in same area or close to it as they wouldnt want to piss off there clientele. Whatever leads you get you cant engage them, let them get comfortable. Just keep digging for evidence. Also, if this is really going to come down, I think they need to be infiltrated re: Project Veritas or Alex Jones Bohemian Grove. Thats the only way.</p></p>

<p><p>Someone thinks you're crazy, maybe we should comment and expose the truth</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The conspiracy, dubbed "pizzagate" by those who believe it, is surfacing around the same time an organization called Pizza to the Polls has announced plans to feed pizza to hungry voters who may be waiting in long lines at their polling places. No doubt, these internet sleuths will discover how the seemingly kind gesture is in fact a plot to commit voter fraud across America.</p>

<p><p>Trying too. Have you taken a look at the evidence..im trying to stay level headed.

<p><p>I have seen the evidence. At the very least, it's a series of strange coincidences. Honestly I don't find it too convincing. It's something that can happen when you look for patterns where there is none, something humans are very good at. I'm not saying people should stop looking, but at least realize that they might be innocent. If they indeed are, wouldn't it suck to completely destroy this guys business? </p></p>

<p><p>I'm going to put together a clear and consice link timeline that shows the very basics. Atleast the Wikileaks (PODESTA) TO Comet PING PONG (JA instagram etc) link. People are just not getting this, and they should. ITS RIGHT FUCKING THERE. This isn't a strange series of coincidences if you KNOW the background. This isnt made up bullshit, alot of it comes from wikileaks. Unless your willfully blind...this early stuff isnt even the confusing part...its the web after that counts.</p></p>

<p><p>The link between podesta and Comet is probably real, yes. That doesn't mean they are running a satanic cannibalistic pedophile ring with Obama. I've seen the evidence and much of it is made up. For example, the handkerchief story is bullshit and somebody edited wiki. </p></p>

<p><p>"somebody edited wiki."
You come here demanding evidence and then throw out a statement backed by no evidence whatsoever.  Wikileaks has never been shown to be wrong on anything they have released, so they more credibility than most organizations.  Any credibility you had just went out the window.</p></p>

<p><p>im not a shill or denying any of this, it's stupid of him to say 'we have all this evidence' when there's barely any actual evidence and a lot of the evidence being proposed is just speculation.</p></p>
