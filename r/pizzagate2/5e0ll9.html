<p><p>Notice how he says "I just finished pizza." Not "I just had a slice of pizza." And how he stares off like he did something wrong after he eats it for a whole minute. It's weird. Nobody else seems too interested in the Pizza Underground stuff on this subreddit though</p></p>

<p><p>Did you also know that the Pizza video was a direct copy of a video by Andy Warhol eating a cheeseburger</p></p>
