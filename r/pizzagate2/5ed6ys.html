<strong>How to wake up the mass.</strong>
<p><p>Organize marches, community art, etc on busy streets with signs that say "Clintons = pedophiles" with a #PizzaGate hashtag. This will help wake them up once they see lots of people gathered &amp; research it.</p></p>

<p><p>This is a dumb post - yes, we need to wake up the masses, but walking around eith a sign that says clintons are pedophiles would make us look like lunatics.</p>
<p>Waking the masses can be a gradual thing - as long as we stay on point, we are in the process of waking people in droves as we speak</p></p>

<p><p>Right... so just do it slowly online &amp; be censored while kids suffer? Crowds of people holding signs will get the most attention. Who cares if people think we're crazy at first?</p></p>

<p><p>It is important that people do not think we are crazy, because this thing that is being uncovered is completely counter-cultural and contrary to everything that everybody who has been alive has known and is used to.  Seemingly, all politicians, most major celebrities and news media are all complicit, or at best, they are ignorant to it.  The only things that we have working for us right now are a fine line of suspicion/evidence, and our resolve.</p>
<p>Our movement only works if we gain numbers, since the major organizations that we SHOULD be able to count on aren't doing their jobs.  If we go full blown crazy and spout crazy things, jump to conclusions without evidence, then people will dismiss us as lunatics or conspiracy theorists, and then we will lose numbers.  Unless some smoking gun evidence shows up, we can only progress at the rate that people convert based on the evidence that we do have.</p></p>
