<p><p>I just hope that as this thing gains traction, and enough people are looking, that someone with close (or any) knowledge would feel safe enough to come forward. </p>
<p>If we can push it mainstream enough, we might get witnesses speaking.</p></p>

<p><p>Cathy O'Neil and others might actually provide some data points. It might be a waste of time. As it stands, this isn't exactly spam. We're dealing with real spam and trolls. When we've taken care of them, we'll try to improve how things are upvoted etc.</p></p>

<p><p>It's a toss up. This may be a case of Hollywood working against itself: There was a show on Netflix about missing kids and MKUltra programming that was pretty popular recently. The name eludes me. People may be more interested in the subject if it was pop culture a few months back. Then again, downside, it's used as a theme for entertainment so may be discredited on that alone.</p></p>
