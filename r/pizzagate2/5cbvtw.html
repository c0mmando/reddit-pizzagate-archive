Hi, can you tell me more about the store's sign and logo? Who decided to add those particular letter Os to the sign?</p>
<p>Any idea why they match the "ping pong paddles" from across the street?  </p></p>

<p><p>Well, actually Comet Pizza is not across the streeet, its a few stores down. And as for the font, I believe its the same font used for American Horror Story, so I think its just a regular font and the connection is just far fetched and made from nothing.</p></p>

<p><p>I haven't met anyone in politics through the store, but I know that my Grandma has met Obama and probably some other people. And its extremely common for big name people to go to P&amp;P. It's one of the most famous and well known book stores in DC.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm not OP but I am his very close friend IRL (/u/miracow can confirm this.) I'm not ruling anything out, but a lot of what I've seen on this sub is pretty hyperbolic and far fetched. Comet isn't a creepy restaurant covered in satanic art with random kids running around. It's pretty weird looking inside but it looks no different from any other hipster DC restaurant. That being said, I'm keeping an open mind because you guys do have some pretty profound evidence, but due to me living in the area I have a hard time taking a lot of this seriously when I see a bunch of people blindly accenting things about these Connecticut avenue stores that are simply untrue. I'm not so sure about Comet, but I can say with absolute 100% certainty Politics and Prose is not involved in any shadiness at all. </p></p>

<p><p>I'm not sure how often you are over at Comet, but do you have any idea what their employee turnover is like? I imagine if things happen there the owner doesn't want a bunch of new employees all the time.</p>
<p>What's your opinion on the other pizza shop right there? Is there that much demand for pizza on that block? Besta changed their logo on their site to remove the inside triangle, but that might just be from all the attention they and Comet are getting.</p>
<p>Oh, ever see John Podesta in Prose? He mentioned t at least once in the emails.</p></p>

<p><p>I've actually only been there once so I'm not really sure about the employees there. The other shop, Besta, is pretty good. Comet and Besta are a lot different though. Comet is more like a hipster sit down place, while Besta is basically just like a Dominoes or something. As for the logo change, I don't think that's related to claims, maybe they just thought it was time for a new look. And no I've never seen podesta in there before. It's possible he's been there but I really didn't know about him until the whole Wikileaks thing, so I'm not sure.</p></p>

<p><p>Hey, I'm OPs friend and the one who got him to do this AMA. I actually semi-know someone who works at Comet, he's the older brother of a kid I went to middle school with. This is purely anecdotal because I don't know any other Comet employees, but he's been there for about 2 years. Besta Pizza is fucking delicious, thats my opinion about them lmao. In all seriousness though, I'm pretty sure the logo change does have to do with the claims because I was reading a thread on /r/WashingtonDC that was saying Comet has been getting threatening calls all week from Pizzagate people, so I'd assume Besta Pizza has been getting the same kind of calls, probably prompting the logo change. Also excuse my friend's lack of political knowledge, I have no idea how he'd never heard of John Podesta until now. I've never met any "Political Elite" besides for when Michelle Obama visited my school and I've lived in DC my whole life. It's a common misconception that DC is just crawling with famous politicians all the time, most political elite types on both sides of the aisle go to more downtown type restaurants. Comet Ping Pong and all the Connecticut Avenue stores are in Chevy Chase, which is a neighborhood that is technically in the city borders but is pretty much a suburb, not a lot of Political type people hanging around. Also neither of us are CTR shills, I admit im not a huge Trump fan (I actually cannot stand the guy) but I hate Hillary just as much, if her career crashes and burns there will be no tears from me... the same applies to Trump.</p></p>
