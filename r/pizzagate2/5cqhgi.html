<strong>Epstein - Billionaire Pedophile's Helicopter SHARED SAME tail number as STATE DEPARTMENT COUNTER INSURGENCY PLANE?</strong>
<p><hr/>
<h1>This EPSTEIN (Lolita Express / Pedophile Island) / Hillary State Dept LINK</h1>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Epstein Helicopter SHARED tail number of a STATE DEPARTMENT COUNTER INSURGENCY PLANE?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The STATE DEPT Plane Happened to Crash (sure)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pilot survived but his info wasn't released due to 'National Security Reasons' (sure)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.occurrencesforeigndomestic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Madsen-on-Epstein-Dyncorp-et-al.pdf">LINK TO DYNCORP PLANE and EPSTEIN TAIL NUMBER STORY</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>Not sure how professionals cope with this stuff day in and day out...I can only take small doses of this shit. </p>
<p>This one seems too obvious and I recalled it being reported on months back as insignificant. </p>
<hr/>
<p>**KEY NOTES</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DynCorp was 'Blamed' for Missing 1 Billion by State Dept. The 'loose' contracts and awards seem far more interesting when you reach this level of spy thriller stuff you can't make up.**</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A counter insurgency 'plane' likely had special flight clearances and freedom of navigation. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Epstein's helicopter having the same TAIL NUMBER suddenly appears quite convenient. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This link is quite significant. It draws a DIRECT CONNECTION between Hillary's State Dept and DynCorp -- as well as clear and direct involvement with Epstein. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using private contractors is the perfect cover -- and meets the Clinton's desire to be a layer removed to give plausible deniability and someone to blame when they go into 'deny, deny, deny' mode. All of their worst criminal activity has been done via a bunch of 'private contractors' and 'security firms' -- which no doubt are crawling with the ilk. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h1>Then the plot thickens (based on OP's post below):</h1>
<h1>Dyncorp Link to Hillary Clinton State Dept / SoS</h1>
<p>(source)  From OP's Post:</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bdso0/dyncorp_child_trafficking_hillary_covers_up/?st=IV6ELSQ5&amp;sh=56d7e819</p>
<h2>Copied below from his post:</h2>
<p>Wikileak Email 15526: https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/15526</p>
<p>from Hillary Clinton's archive mentions Dyncorps hiring an "adolescent boy dancer" from Afghanistan "for some sort of event that, at least to most folks, looked very inappropriate." Here is a direct quote ""According to my reporting, the week of April 13th, the DynCorp regional commander from Konduz, Flint Chambers, allowed his men to hire a 15-year-old boy dancer to do tribal dances at a DynCorp party on the training site. Some 15 or so DynCorp employees in attendance pulled out a single chair and had the boy do mock lap dances. This was captured on video. The video shows DynCorp employees putting dollar bills in the boy's waistband, just as they would a stripper's garter. The revelry lasted about 45 minutes."</p>
<hr/>
<p>...This is sent directly to Hillary Clinton from Cheryl Mills who is one of her big time lawyers. </p>
<p>Why would a LAWYER be messaging Hillary this if she didn't have direct ties to DynCorp?</p>
<hr/>
<p>I did some investigating into DynCorp and... </p>
<p>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-isenberg/its-dj-vu-for-dyncorp-all_b_792394.html</p>
<p>they were involved in a sex scandal slavery in Bosnia in 1999. "its employees accused of rape and the buying and selling of girls as young as 12." [Quote from article.]</p>
<hr/>
<p>They have a long history of this. In 2005 the Chicago Tribune accused the government of covering up child trafficking. http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-0512270176dec27-story.html</p>
<p>According to this Portguese article Hillary is in favor of DynCorp. http://portugal.indymedia.org/conteudo/newswire/25091</p>
<p>In her emails there is another about "inappropriate behavior by department contractor." https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/15562</p>
<hr/>
<p>Talking more about DynCorp. DynCorp is known for a gross history of sexual assault. The CEO is Lewis Von Thaer. But the parent organization of DynCorp? Cerberus Capital Management.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton has ties to both Cerberus and DynCorp. Cerberus gave $40,628 to her campaign. https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000021907&amp;cycle=2016</p>
<p>The state department lost $1 billion dollars and DynCorp is to blame. http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/01/25/report-faults-state-department-dyncorp-for-missing-1-billion/</p>
<hr/>
<p>What is ironic is they appointed Jack Lew (Hillary's right hand man, according to the article) to look into it. DynCorp has a history of stealing money. "1991 State of the Nation It appears that Dyncorp broke the original investigation on this. Dyncorp was the accountant for roughly $2.7 trillion missing 1991-2001. Also missing in 1996 or 1997; $60 billion missing out of HUD. Dyncorp appears to be the accounting division of the US government these days." </p>
<p>http://www.newsfollowup.com/clinton_9-11_truth_wtc_israel_saudi_arabia_uk_nuclear_demolition_president_election_hillary_bush_2016.html</p>
<hr/>
<p>Hillary covered up for DynCorp.</p>
<pre><code>The Washington Post wrote about it to her.

Later they publish a story saying the DynCorp employee was fired and no mention of the boy.

Nothing ended up being done.

<hr/>
<p>And here are the "sensitive but unclassified" documents from her emails. </p>
<p>http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2138241-c05761762.html#document/p1</p>
<hr/>
<p>What is most disgusting is we now know Hillary has covered up for Weiner texting an underage girl and Laura Silsby's crew of kidnapping children from Haiti for trafficking.</p>

<hr/>
<p>All above was from the OP Post linked to. </p>
<p>I don't know if he did the add'l post he said he was going to do.</p>
<p>Looks thorough, but I haven't looked at it further and taking his word for it.</p>

<p><p>haha - I hear that. I've put in 20 hours days trying to organize things (on other topics and left this one to others after it got far enough along. Still in shock there isn't any sign of it being covered by the media or any action being taken.</p>

<p><p>It's probably common knowledge but I just created an anon account so I could expand on the Afghan boy dancer thing.</p>
<p>When I deployed to Afghanistan we learned about this underage boys. Commonly called "Chai boys" they're underage boys that are forced to dance for adult males. Usually forced into (rarely paid) they usually do something comparative to a lap dance. Bells on their feet, skimpy clothes, etc. The whole thing is pretty disgusting. Usually ends in sodomy. The local Afghans that I worked with told us all about them. These people (the sick ones; not all Afghans) view women as procreation and boys for pleasure.</p>
<p>It was not uncommon to hear about men raping boys while you were out on patrols. There was actually a popular article about a Green Berets facing UCMJ action because he intervened and beat the shit out of a guy who was raping a boy while he was deployed. </p></p>

<p><p>My understanding of the situation is that this is a very very old practice that seems shocking to western civilization in modern times. Certainly not really all that shocking when considering their often brutal culture parallels what was witnessed in the middle ages. Violent and predatory sexual practices just seem to come with the attitude when you are able to sincerely view any group of people as objects of your environment.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to read more. It has an actual common term for the dance: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacha_bazi">bacha bazi</a>.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm sure it was very common in Europe thousands years ago. No way of knowing when it stopped because things like that never gets written in the history books. If people think it didn't happen during the conquest of the native Americans, south America, or Africa would be very surprised if they known the truth. </p></p>

<p><p>Yes because the government and those Christians that wrote the history would record it. Are you telling me that with all the forced marriages, parents killing their children, children killing their parents, mistresses, invading countries, fighting savages, Viking raids and so no nothing like that happened in the western world? </p>
<p>I also noticed you didn't say anything about what happened in the Americas and Africa.</p></p>

<p><p>So WTF does any of that drivel of supposed history of ALL European peoples have to do with the last 200 years?  </p>
<p>And for someone who supposedly knows history, almost all of the violence committed in Europe for the last 1500 years has been perpetrated by elements of the Roman Catholic Church.  Try to keep on subject...no one cares about your retelling without any evidence of what supposedly happened hundreds and thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>The fact is, all of this devil worship and child trafficking has its origins in Babylon, which transferred to Rome then to Venice then to Holland and London.  And this is shown in numerous recent books including Richard Farrel and others.  I'm certainly not going to do your work for you though.  You need to stop reading books written by the likes of Bill O'Reilly.</p></p>

<p><p>I know Greece isn't "europe proper"  but the entire man boy love thing originated there. Men had a young boy as his pure love and a wife...yada yada...Roman soldiers preferred "their own company" to the company of women...and young soldiers=popular.</p>
<p>There are many notorious Europeans known for their love of boys...aristocracy.</p>
<p>In Africa men have boy lovers...that's why so many gay brit men joined up to be posted there..big scandal in UK lately about ..well no doxing..and it's also a thing in some parts of SA. Never ever google asses of the caribean. it doesn't mean what you think. Then there's sheep...in Scotland which are better than boys...then the Priests...dude priests been slippin the doodle to young boys for centuries in Europe.</p></p>

<p><p>I know I'm late to this party, but this whole practice is known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoR9sBrm5ig">Bacha Bazi</a>, Frontline did a great documentary on it where the Bacha Bazi ring runs as deep as government officials and police chiefs. I don't know if this is proof, but here it allegedly happened in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MpnpcCLvtM">Paris, France</a>.</p></p>

<p>Check out this thread from earlier today... connections between government, children's charities, and an airport...</p>
<p>There is much information in public records showing partnerships and plane transfers... Tailnumbers were part of the equation. </p>
<p>Another wiki connection leads to http://www.aeroelectric.com/Pictures/Misc/</p>
<p>A lot of aircraft stuff in there... a few babies too... but also... Pizza Hut...</p></p>

<p><p>These government contracts are are talking about were they signing under the Obama administration or the Bush administration? If they were from the bush administration did they all of a sudden turned bad? </p>
<p>As for email #15526, the email chain was forwarded to her after everything happened not before or during. How would that indicate anything bad on her part. </p></p>

<p><p>Do you know that 186 billion dollars is about 15% of the total us spending on equipment during the Obama administration, and no one noticed. Looking at the post below it has been happening during the bush administration. They either were too stupid to know what was happening or involved in it.</p></p>

<p><p>If you haven't fully explored this - They have been been operating since the early 90s without stopping. That is the key that you are missing. (Well, actually all the way back to Arkansas) - Revolving door of the same people throughout. This isn't a partisan thing. It appears to be an "establishment" thing. </p></p>
