<p><p>You are going to approach these people as they are grieving with a crazy ass theory involving child trafficking, pedophilia, some of the most rich and powerful people in America including a former US president, a Serbian artist, Satanism/occult, and finally a pizza shop.  With nothing solid and concrete.  How many of those family members or friends are going to think its just some sick trolling from some fuckers on the internet (or worse blame it on Trump supporters because The_Donald found it)?  A few might complain to police that will just lead to it being swept under the rug and giving the real sickos a heads up that we found a new bread crumb we are going to follow to their hopeful downfall.  Time to double and triple check the cover story for holes and scour the new for any other overlooked details.</p></p>

<p><p>OMG thank you lol</p>
<p>I am going nuts over here by all these fucking accounts telling people to give it up, that is a "crazy ass theory" with "nothing solid and concrete".</p>
<p>NOTHING SOLID AND CONCRETE?!</p>
<p>THERE IS MORE EVIDENCE IN THIS THERE IS THAT WE LANDED ON THE FUCKING MOON!  </p>
<p>Any person who has dug through enough of that bullshit and done serious reading as well as remained aware of the progression of new connections and reports fucking KNOWS it is real. There is too much.</p>
<p>The fact that they are trying SO FUCKING HARD to down play it and make it sound crazy is proof in and of itself that these people are scared because the trail is getting hotter. Mother fuckers are in full defesne and retaliation mode. This is their contingency plan.</p>
<p>Thank you for not falling for it grlledcheese87. </p>
<p>"stop digging. plz stop. plz. Nothing to see here. No evidence. Crazy theory. Move along now"</p>
<p>Fucking morons if they aren't shills</p>
<p>edit: haha this guy just replied to me and said its crazy theory bc "their logo is a triangle omg" </p>
<p>Comet Pizza is a pizza place owned by James Alefantis, who is the former gay boyfriend of David Brock, the CEO of Correct The Record. That was directly working with the Clinton campaign and the DNC. We have thousands of emails now exposing them and we KNOW they are connected in complex and multiple ways. So many people are involved and it is so much connection that the average reader can't keep track of it all and rather say "whatever, no way" because that is the defense mechanism these people have structured to keep their illegal activities safe in harbor. </p>
<p>JUST A FUCKING TRIANGLE?</p>
<p>...yeah not the fact that he has a picture of a girl tied on his Instagram. And there is a dungeon called "the play room" and they talk "having a pizza" in hidden rooms. And the creepy ass video "advertisement" of that kid. And the pagan gods symbols on their entrance sign. and the face that "pizza" is refrenced 50+ times in the emails and not once were they talking about food. They ordered $65K of "hot dogs" to Obama. </p>
<p>The "hot dog" stand in Hawaii. The spirit cooking. The "moloch" (child sacrificing god) refrences. The fact that in his Instagram post "moloch" is printed on a towel. The "art work" the podestas have in their home of naked children. The fact that the campaigne and all the people connected are DIRECTLY connected with Comet Pizza some way or another. </p>
<p>ART OF KIDS. OF PEOPLE BEING EATEN. SPIRIT COOKING DINNERS.</p>
<p>photos has hidden bathroom doors and creepy murals. The bathrooms in particular have murals exclusively of nude women, as well as a great deal of graffiti relating to sex. Reviews of the restaurant are bizarrely polarized. </p>
<p>Billionaire Pedophile Jeffrey Epstein Sent Bill Clinton $3.5 Million From Secret Swiss Bank Account http://pastebin.com/GsYbAQtp
Tons of pre-existing evidence of global pedo-ring implicating governments and etc. http://pastebin.com/eUvcF9bm
A Powerful Billionaire, the Sex Scandal that Undid Him, and All the Justice that Money Can Buy: http://pastebin.com/BpiSdSXp</p>
<p>The fact that that had a speech that was so fuckign odd if you listen to it makes your skin crawl about "try our new young pretty special pizza that has never been eaten before" </p>
<p>How his name fucking translates " I love Children " in French. And how that is downplayed. How they refrence hidden passageways and rooms and tunnels and how the map of that area shows how close everything truly is.</p>
<p>The Soros, who is also paying this shills to tell me "it is just a triangle", donated 11k to the Pizza place. Why does everyone fucking love pizza so much again? </p>
<p>That the Laura Sibling girl was caught illegally trafficking Haiti kids into America when their families said they never were told their children were going to be orphaned just protected. And that the emails state a price for the kids in the fucking email. And that the SAME people who saved her and got her back to America are directly involved to this fucking arcade chucke cheese wanna be pizza place.</p>
<p>Look at his fucking Instagram dude. They are laughing in our faces because they know they are untouchable. Its fucking infuriating that you would say "its just a triangle". I didn't even touch on 10% of the evidence, NOT EVEN 10%. </p>
<p>Just a triangle? Shut the fuck up. </p></p>

<p><p>Don't bring google/chrome running like shit into this. That's unrelated and it will make us look like idiots if we even mention that in an argument. I'm not saying this to be mean or anything, but we really need to cut the shit so people know this shit's forreal and we're not pulling stuff out our arses. </p></p>

<p><p>I'm sorry you feel spooked. You're in no danger. There's a negligible chance that Redditors stumbled onto an international child abuse ring perpetuated by people currently in the US election spotlight and centered on a pizza place and its neighbors. I have a suspicion that pizzagate  started with a couple of (relatively) well-intentioned conjectures based on coincidences, then was fueled by shitposters stoking the flames.</p></p>

<p><p>Most leads are discredited but the ones that no one seems to discredit or question have made this earn its own nutty hashtag.  If you hear the words pedo ring and then look at all the coincidences and the links between them all it is hard not to see something very weird is going on there.  Anthony Wiener and his hard-on photo next to a baby + his current legal troubles with a minor, The FBIanon releasing pedo symbols and asking for help, then Ping Pong and the Ape.  Fucking weird shit, we know the families operate on blackmail, is theirs Moloch and children?  Wouldn't be the first time in history</p></p>

<p><blockquote>
<p>That the Laura Sibling girl was caught illegally trafficking Haiti kids into America when their families said they never were told their children were going to be orphaned just protected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read that the parents knew the kids would be taken away, but apparently the issue was like you said, they didn't know the kids would be treated as orphaned, and thus shipped off to somewhere with no chance of the parents getting to see them again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And that the emails state a price for the kids in the fucking email.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I never got this one. The email I read stated transportation costs (~$200 per person?). How is that pricing the kids as slaves exactly?</p>
<p>Only thing I can thing of is it's too cheap for a flight, and probably also not enough to bus/boat them to safety. Which means...it could have indeed been the price to buy a human person. But still, it didn't seem as clear to me as it does to others.</p></p>

<p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't, though. "L'Enfant" doesn't translate as "children", it translates as "the younger", as in <em>Pierre Charles L'Enfant</em>, the architect and city planner who laid out Washington DC, and for whom we have hundreds of things named after. All of which you would have discovered in one second if you'd googled it.</p>
<p>Holy shit people like you are ignorant.</p></p>

<p><p>What the hell man!?</p>
<p>As a french speaker, you are insane.</p>
<p>L'Enfant, specifically, means "the child".  Le Enfant. Le = The, Enfant = Child.</p>
<p>Better yet, try google translate: https://translate.google.com/#fr/en/l'enfant</p>

<p><blockquote>

<p>That's a transliteration, not a translation. In a guy's name, it's like "Pliny the Younger" - Pierre Charles <em>L'Enfant.</em> Paul Charles <em>the Younger.</em> And, of course, <em>on a T-shirt in Washington DC</em> it's a reference to one of the hundreds of different DC locations named after him, in this particular case, a cafe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are working for the government</p>

<p>Oh, shit, you've broken the case wide open, I've only repeatedly mentioned in comments that I'm an employee of an HHS agency. Nothing gets by you!</p></p>

<p>What the fuck do you mean? It is so much more than that. It is not just a triangle. Get that weak ass shit out of here. </p>
<p>If my loved one was murdered chasing a CHILD SEX TRAFFICING story and there was mounting evidence of CHILD SEX TRAFFICING being investigated and exposed on the internet that DIRECTLY CONNECTED WHAT SHE WAS DOING TO WHAT IS BEING EXPOSED, then yes I would want to see the evidence. I would dive head first into it.</p>
<p>I believe 100% anyone who sees the evidence won't come out saying "this is just a triangle".  The will say "I will not rest until I avenge the mother fuckers that murdered by daughter".</p>
<p>Also, I could give a fuck less about your post history. </p>

<p>Hmm. This is news to me?  I don't see that as the reputation. I see their reputation as one of the only places on the internet to find truth hidden in a sea of lies and deciept. The only place that doesn't censor news stories to fit their narrative. The reputation of patriots who defended their country while being under heavy attack of their character and personal lifes from opposition since the opposition couldn't win fair and square. </p>
<p>They aren't trolls because they post funny pictures. You're the fucking troll. </p></p>

<p><p>Dude..they already know. They are here right now reading this. They have had their hands all of it from the very start. We are not gaining some advantage by attacking them with the elemant of surprise. </p>
<p>You don't think they have been surfing the Donald and keeping up with the story since it first came to surface? It is all hands on deck on this site. CTR is in full force.</p>
<p>I mean the owner of the place is the one who helped start CTR...for god sake. Of course they have deep roots here. </p>
<p>They know everything that is discovered because they are here right now trying their damnest to say "its just a triangle move along now"</p>
<p>They clearly don't care enough to delete their Instagram posts, etc. They know the trail is hot. The people doing the real investigation will be a step ahead no matter what. The people who just follow and discuss like you and I? We might as well spread that information. That is yesterdays news. The more eyes the better. People need to wake and see how things really are.</p>
<p>I'm not going to rely on some fucking police department of FBI take these guys out. There are clearly stipulations which are holding that back form happening or Clinton would be in jail right now. </p></p>

<p>OR don't want to look suspicious you know? just delete the <em>really</em> disturbing ones and leave the ones that you can say: "there's nothing weird about it".</p></p>

<p>Ok first I'm not talking about the original besta pizza logo (that only changed because idiots like you thinks it's a good idea to post on their Facebook or make pizzagate YouTube videos</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If that happened to my business I'd be quickly giving all of my information and letting it be known that we were not aware of the logo symbolism, I would want people to be absolutely sure I don't have anything to do with that, that is was just a graphic designer messing up.</p>
<p>BUT, what did they do? change the logo the next day without saying anything, almost sounds like the type of things people do when they get caught isn't it? just the first thing you can think of that can save you, you don't think you just act in desperation to be saved.</p>
<p>IMHO this is what happened.</p></p>

<p><p>Exactly. You can't tell people to stop looking into it and investigating because it will hurt the investigation. That is literally (not like literally as liberals use it, literally as in the definition of the word)..that is LITERALLY a catch 22. A paradox. A logical fallacy. Whatever it is, it doesn't make any fucking sense. </p>
<p>"You tipped them off! They changed their logo!"</p>
<p>BY the way geniuses...if they only get tipped off AFTER WE FIND OUT THE INFORMATION, it does them no fucking good! Maybe they DID have more information stored and hidden away that they deleted before people had time to dig deeper ..but GUESS WHAT. IF SOMEONE DIDN'T POINT OUT THE CONNECTION ANYWAY, NO ONE WOULD HAVE LOOKED INTO TO BEGIN WITH!</p>
<p>Obvioulsy this is bigger than a one man show. I'm sure their are plenty of active diggers who are sitting on important information and only sharing internally for this very reason. But once it is out it is out. ONCE IT IS OUT AND IT IS OUT SO WHY NOT TALK ABOUT AND SPREAD THE WORD?!?!?</p>
<p>Ok good - so we are making progress and are on the right track. Obviously they saw something wrong with their logo huh? If it was just a triangle why did they change it? </p>
<p>Because they're scared. And what do people do when they're scared?</p>
<p>They run home. </p></p>

<p><p>Doesnt it make it even more suspicios that obly via de web page you could see the other logo until last week?</p>
<p>Imo it only makes it more weird, why not change the logo of the main page if you already have another one for android?</p>

<p><p>Eh... Local businesses don't always have their shit together, even chains. </p>
<p>I dunno what to make of all this necessarily, but just a sign that the logo switch not necessarily something new. Frankly I'm surprised nobody here has actually visited these places to report instead of relying on second-hand info. </p></p>

<p><p>Hol' up hol up hol up hol hol up hol up.  </p>
<p>That's racist. </p>
<p>The last thing someone wants when their loved one mysteriously dies is answers. That is the LAST thing people want. The LAST THING parents grieving the distrubinly errie death of the daughter is to be given information that could potentially lead to some ANSWERS!</p>
<p>Just stop digging!!  Stop sharing the information!</p>
<p>Its just pizza!   </p>
<p>No way do loved ones EVER want to know why and how their loved one died. Espeically if their is mountains of evidence. We should just delete this subreddit and thread and go on with our lives. We don't need answers we need grieving!</p>
<p>I call for a meeting with plah-doh, bubbles, hot chocolate and pizza in a safe place to sit it out while this all blows over.</p>
<p>Where should we do it? </p>
<p>Bohemian Grove? </p>
<p>Nahhh the DNC already claimed that. hmmm</p>
<p>Lets meet a comet pizza. </p>
<p>I hear a lot of rich elite people and powerful politicians like to hang out there too!  We all know the elite's love to hang out at Chuck E Cheese and play arcade games with kids!</p>
<p>From their reviews it seems 5 star. We should "have a pizza for an hour"</p>
<p>Then maybe some spirit cooking' for desert? </p>
<p>Crazy how everything discussing this stuff from November 7th and prior is DELTED FROM THE FUCKING INTERNET.</p>
<p>So yeah. Lets just delete this and move on folks :) </p>
<p>if we don't, ppl will think we are crazyyyyyyy omg!!!</p></p>

<p><p>Tell them everything. They deserve to know how connected and evil Clinton is. They deserve to know what their daughter was murdered for investigating. This is huge. The family will have tremendous pain from the loss of their daughter, they will have doubts, but you can help make sure those parents know their daughter is not alone, and that she will not have died in vain. </p>
<p>Edit: how many more people need to die before we finally bring the clintons to justice??</p>
<p>Edit 2: how do you think the parents would feel if they knew thousands of other people were actively trying to bring give their late daughter justice? </p></p>

<p><p>it helps when reading them faux-outrage about images that sexualize pizza or dark imagery in art to remember that 4chan invented Pedobear and once created a meme so dark that two twelve year old girls murdered their friend...  oh and they bullied an underage girl to death after convincing her to upload nudes and then blackmailing her with them, and...  </p>
<p>now they're moral crusaders - how the strange the world is...</p></p>

<p><p>Election is over, but Trump has taken his seat yet. I wonder what's up the sleeve of the Clinton's internet team. Shills disappeared for a day after the election, and then made an obvious reappearance. I'm not saying you're a shill because of your opinion. You're free to have your opinion, hoss. I'm saying there's real shills. They're a real thing. So buy into the Clinton Faction. Some of us join other Factions. Choose carefully who you side with. It has real life consequences. </p></p>

<p><p>You can keep low by not notifying everyone around that this is happening. Instagram accounts have already be made private, logos changed, web pages changed. This happens because people are writing shit on their posts, sending messages with accusations, etc.</p>
<p>Now that the cat is out of the bag it's a little harder to keep low but the research being done is compromised when we reveal ourselves immediately.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Verifiable facts:</strong></p>
<p>She didn't work for HTC anymore.</p>
<p>She worked as a teacher in Haiti.</p>
<p>Her investigation into human trafficking took place in august 2015 (edit: she only went there for a few weeks)</p>
<p>She wrote and article in 2015, critical about Clinton's policies around Haiti.</p>
<p>She never connected Clinton with child trafficking in Haiti.</p>
<p>She died in November 2016. No cause stated.</p>
<p>Edit: looks like is was confirmed by people who knew her that she committed suicide. Nothing to do with Clintons</p>
<p><strong>OP's claim:</strong></p>
<p>Monica was investigating Clinton's connection with child trafficking in Haiti on behalf of HTC. She was murdered because of this.</p>
<p>Notice the difference?</p></p>

<p><p>Sure. Calling out your delusional bullshit and proving you wrong over and over again means I'm working for Clinton.</p>
<p>Check my post history. I dare you to find anything even remotely supportive of Clinton. Do it.</p>

<p><p>Why the fuck would CTR still be active after the election? Their whole point of existence was to get Clinton elected. </p>
<p>By the rate of your accusations there must be millions of people working for an organization that has no purpose for existing anymore. </p>

<p>Pizzagate is definitely scary but not for the reasons this sub thinks. It's proof of how easy it is to spread a few lies over the internet and then watch those lies overtake the truth because people can't be bothered to fact-check.</p></p>

<p><p>It's really some of the worst cases of confirmation bias I have ever witnessed. </p>
<p>4chan makes a meme out of "cheese pizza".</p>
<p>Conspiratards conclude that the "cheese pizza" meme actually means that pizza places are linked to child trafficking.</p>
<p>Therefore, every mentioning of pizza by politicians means child trafficking.</p></p>

<p><p>There are days where I think something as amazing as the internet is lost on us. It's this brilliant creation that's designed to spread information and lead to enlightenment, truly one of the wonders of the modern world... And we're using it to make globe-spanning satanic conspiracies out of food order emails.</p></p>

<p><p>Actually, no. I'm not from the US and I can tell you that as long as the wikileaks are a verified source, then something batshit weird is happening. The claims are based not only on FBI's pedophile information (such as symbols and jargon), but in more than 40/50 emails referencing pizza/sauce/map/etc all out of place of their use in a normal conversation.</p>
<p>So, no. I follow your conspiracy nutcracks and this is as close as they ever got from the truth. And it's not like it's farfetched, we are not talking about religious innuendo of such, don't they need to refer to Illuminati, Reptilians, NWO, nothing but solid evidence and links between individuals, we are talking about what we now to be simbolism within the pedophile community, A FUCKING COMMUNITY THAT IS PRONE TO BE DISMANTLED BY SHIT LIKE THIS IN SOME MANY COUNTRIES: British, Australia, Portugal, Italy, not to talk about East Asia and the sex slave market that goes uncontrolled, and so on. And you know who fell with those pedophile rings? Powerful, artist business people. All of which prosecuted under a court of law. So fuck off, ok?</p>
<p>To this point I can just assume you saw the 4chan's reasoning and not the fucking emails. So why do you feel you're apt to theorize about the post-truth times we live in if you didn't even read the fcking thing?</p></p>

<p><p>You went waaay deeper. I came here trying to figure out what the smoking gun was. Turns out OP doesn't see a difference between a smoking gun like a recording with someone admitting to  X, or some other material proof... and two events that may or may not be connected.</p>
<p>This kind of bullshit takes away from real concerns. </p>
<p>By OP rationale, Trump should consider extending Secret Service protection to entire staff of The Washington Post, NYT, LAT etc, not to talk of those who covered accusations of his paedophilia etc - because if any of these journalists kicks the bucket = irrefutable proof of Trump guilt on those accusations + conspiracy to murder.</p></p>

<p><p>Just like you guys solved the Boston bombers. Shit like this is how you end up with a legitimate mental illness. All these connections "too clear to ignore" are the most tenuous, nonsensical things. Seeing patterns where none actually exist is a hallmark of schizophrenia. It really is something to be careful of.</p></p>

<p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Completely agree with all of the things you said, but that, the connections are pretty clear.</p>
<p>My mental history is pretty regular, I don't have signs of schizophrenia or anything like that, I take care of my mental healthiness.</p>
<p>I don't see patterns where there are none, but this specific case I don't see as a conspiracy, I see it as some emails were leaked from the official NSA page of the United states, and the connections are there.</p>
<p>I'm living my life but I have present that there might be suffering, a lot of people seem to think our lives revolve around it but that's just to make you feel better for not believing.</p>
<p>I've told to 5 of my RL friends, 3 of them I consider are above average smart, and every one of them agreed with me, something fishy is going on, no doubt.</p>
<p>Now if we are going to judge mental health of one and another, why don't you check yours? you seem to be in denial because as I see it it's pretty easy to connect everything, and the fact that you are unable to understand what's going on might be a sign that you are in shock or in denial, something to be careful about too.</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>Just to be clear, I don't believe we are able to identify problems mental problems like you think it is, the last sentence is an example of the thing you said to me but applied to you, just so you understand no one here is crazy, and there's really something fucky going on.</p></p>

<p><p>You are insisting on these things in a thread predicated on a premise that is easily refuted and blatantly false. That's how this whole thing is packaged. The child sex ring based in a pizza chain is really, terrible stupid and none of the 'evidence' is anything more than slapped together innuendo. There is a lot of harm and violence and crime done in this world. Supremely dumb shit like this does nothing to address any of that.</p></p>

<p>I don't think so, I really believe there are clear connections, but we are different people so we'll have to agree to disagree, as nothing can prove anyone wrong until something crazy happens.</p>
<p>I just want to know, are you aware that the same thing happens in other countries? Most americans are unaware of "Los demonios del Edén" and the phone calls that almost ended with Lydia Cacho's life.</p>
<p>People used to say there were stupid connections but when the phone calls were released everyone went silent, a lot of people cried because it involved really powerful people that some of the population admired at the time.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>And coming here denying everything without having the real information does a lot?</p>
<p>At least we are trying to do something good, let us be and carry on, you got nothing to lose.</p>

<p><p>His facts are as better as our facts, the only difference is that I'm not calling him a liar in every single post.</p>
<p>Because I understand this is bigger than us and both our resources can be good, I just find his attitude of calling everyone a liar deplorable, because the people he's calling liars are investigating just like him.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm looking at some of these people's post history and 90% of what they do is just call people retarded, schizophrenic, nut-jobs and justify any Hillary scandal. It's so blatantly obvious what's going on and I've never even realized it before. This shit is getting crAzy. </p></p>

<p>They've started dying long time ago, like the guy who died from barbells, the guy who commited suicide and then hid in the sport bag, the one who was shot during robbery and nothing was stolen from him, and like Assange's lawyer who has fallen under the train.</p></p>

<p><p>Like, there are some really incriminating evidence that I'd reckon is gonna be really hard to explain for Clinton. That, on top of the countless "coincidences" that keeps popping up the case is pretty strong. Maybe not in a court, just yet, but to not take this seriously would be too naive.</p>
<p>Though some are speculating that Clinton is actually dying from Kuru disease(I won't take a stance on this yet as there is little to go on) and will probably never be held accountable.</p></p>

<p><p>They're harassing people and spreading pictures of toddlers, including pics mocked up with sexual language. It's pretty bad. The motivation would be to at least get them to stop spreading those pics everywhere, especially the mocked up ones.</p></p>

<p><p>To be fair, there are people with their lives and businesses in jeopardy because they're being accused of being pedophiles and Satan worshippers, so debunking it would have some merit to proving it false.</p></p>

<p><p>I do believe one could start a religion on Reddit if enough people stay huddling in one sub long enough together, circle-jerking off of each other's ideas. </p>
<p>Sometimes you just need to take a good step back and actually think about what you're investing so much of your energy into. I don't blame anyone here for falling for it, it's kind of the environment that confined spaces on the internet nurture. Food for thought.</p></p>

<p><p>It's also easy to say the Sun will rise in the east tomorrow. </p>
<p>Because it is an ordinary claim requiring no special evidence.</p>
<p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Saying "there is no conspiracy" is the default position, and adversarial evidence needs to be taken more seriously (i.e. play devil's advocate with your ideas.) </p>
<p>You have to be able to refute argumentation from the opposite side, not simply dismiss it. Anyone can "make a case"; the hard part is to win it.</p></p>

<p>Haiti is a dangerous place. I'm not saying her death is not eyebrows raising, but that's it. It's nothing more, and you need actual proof to point fingers. As I said, mere laws of probability would result in people investigating Hillary dying without her doing anything. </p></p>

<p><p>I'm a skeptic, but finding answers means loading up on info. Some info may be worth it in the end, some may be dead ends. You're doing an important job. Ignore the shills and the disbelievers. Any chance to save children from trafficking is worth investigating, no matter the odds. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lazy or trying to prevent us from finding the truth.</p></p>

<p><p>Dear commenters: your cries of disbelief and put-downs of our pizzagate investigators will be looked at only as shilling and will fan the flames. A theory with a 1% chance of truth is still worth investigating to some people if it means a chance to combat child sex trafficking. Just accept it. </p></p>

<p><p>It is healthy to be skeptical. I'd understand you might not want to spend time looking into this, but I recommend reading about this on www.pedocrats.com to get an overlook and at least some idea on why people believe these seemingly outrageous claims. There is some very incriminating language used in the emails that has led to discoveries of connections to child trafficking, at least I, can't dismiss as mere coincidence.</p>
<p>If it doesn't convince you, then I understand. But I wouldn't dismiss this off hand like you would do with 9/11 truthers or lizard people...advocates(if thats the right word). There is merit to this, though I realize how nuts it sounds.</p></p>

<p><p>Lol you idiot.  Shill confirmed.  Check this guy out lads.  One side of the mouth telling us not to look into this cause were crazy, out the other side telling us to be paranoid cause were on to something.  A straight shill trying to cover up pedophilia.   Not a good look on you homeboy.  Spent the last hour trolling along.  This is the type of noise we are breaking through.  Keep digging</p></p>

<p><p>I wish I were a shill. It can be stressful dealing with people who don't care about facts or listen to reason. Dealing with idiots happens to be what I do for a living too. Maybe, we've spoken before.</p></p>

<p><p>We just did, 20 minutes ago in another thread when you called us all idiots.  But people will look at your post history and see you're trying to cover up pedophilia and human trafficking.  So, it's whatever, you know?</p></p>

<p><p>The fuck does politics have to do with pedophilia and why are you so hell bent on stopping people from exposing human trafficking?  People understand at this point pizza = children.  So you just come off as someone who doesn't want pedophilia to be investigated.  Why don't you want it to be investigated?</p></p>

<p><p>The problem is that there's no pedophilia involved. It was all made up by someone who hated the thought of a female president. And all of you are just eating it up because you love that narrative. I'm going to make something up and throw it out there for you to swallow. And when I see it on here and I'm going to laugh to myself. I'm not even going to tell you it's fake. </p></p>

<p><p>Cross post from The Donald......</p>
<p>This is something I posted a while back on The Donald, it seems relevant now due to the mention of Caracol....</p>
<p>Moving on:</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3778</p>
<p>In 2010, it appears that Cheryl Mill's planted a story in the NYT titled "Building Haiti's Economy One Mango At A Time". Mills forwards the story to HRC. HRC asks "who does he work for" (meaning the writer Jean-Louis Warnholz) and Mills responds "he works for us now".</p>
<p>Note: Perhaps crafting a plausible cover? Cheryl Mills and places with poor birth records were talked about by FBI Anon.</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/19339 And fast forward 2 years, Jean-Louis emails Cheryl with the following "Random Good News".... "Cheryl</p>
<p>Because it's that kind of day and that kind of week:</p>
<p>1) Sae-A shipped the first 65,000 shirts 'Made in Haiti' that should hit Walmart stores soon. They now employ a 1,000 workers, many trained by a USG-financed training center.</p>
<p>2) <em>Only two mango trees had to be uprooted at the Caracol Park. Trees under threat are now being transplanted to the Caracol Ekam housing. </em>"</p>
<p>Note: So he felt the need to tell them that these two trees "under threat" were uprooted and moved to the Caracol Ekam housing. Caracol Ekam is a housing project and this just sounds weird I have not been able to find any info about an actual mango grow operation.</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/17422 And perhaps the creepiest one occurred just two months later on December 21, 2012. HRC emails Cheryl Mills and asks "How is Seven doing? Any photos?".</p>
<p>WTH is this? If this is what it could potentially be (referring to a person with a number), I am ill. So, thoughts on mango as a codeword? The locations and people are right. Jean-Louis Warnholz and Cheryl Mills both now work at The Black Ivy Group.</p>

<p><p>Mills responded "he works for us now" because Jean-Louis Warnholz joined the State Department in 2010. Why do you have twist the meaning of a very obvious email to be something nefarious? (Rhetorical question.)</p></p>

<p><p>Yes, Warnholz obviously went from working for Soros to working for Clinton...I guess whether that is nefarious depends on your opinion of Clinton and Soros.</p></p>

<p><p>Eh, not quite - he went to work for the State Department, not "for Clinton." Which is a real difference in context of the discussion being had here.</p></p>

<p><p>Split hairs much?  If you think someone working under killary and cheryl mills at state was loyal to anyone other than killary......well, I cant help you because you aren't paying attention.</p>
<p>Yeah, former George Soros employee reporting to his new employer about mango trees "under threat" that were moved to Caracol housing complex mentioned by recently suicided investigator...seems legit.  In fact, he probably has an agriculture degree.   Funny that this was the only time mangoes were mentioned in the emails that were released.</p>
<p>Point is, none of this is conclusive by itself right now...maybe it's innocent, maybe not.  All we can do is pay attention to out of place wording and establish connections until more info is revealed.  And this time, I feel like it will be.</p></p>

<p><p>Of course all the low class idiots come from /r/The_Donald to spout of their uneducated guesses and stupidity. </p>
<p>You don't even know how she died or what killed her and you make assumptions linking to Clinton. Do you uneducated morons even know what a fallacy is or proper logical reasoning? Nope, you don't, your voting record shows that. </p></p>
