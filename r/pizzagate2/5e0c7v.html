<strong>Kanye West associate Malik Yousef posted some very interesting tweets</strong>
<p><p>He's doing a bit of a Q&amp;A and he gave some pretty interesting answers.</p>
<p>Q: @malikyusef can you just give us a hint about whats wrong with kanye since you know. please. i'm crying.</p>
<p>A: <a href="https://twitter.com/malikyusef/status/800263336696758272">Just a lot of recent information coming down,and he just tryna translate it 2 himself first</a></p>
<p>Q: @malikyusef i know he's going through some real personal shit but this isn't the way to express emotion. this is far overboard even for him</p>
<p>A: <a href="https://twitter.com/malikyusef/status/800257318344540162">It's true but still deeper than that</a></p>
<p>Q: is the illuminati threatening to spirit cook kanye?</p>
<p>A: <a href="https://twitter.com/malikyusef/status/800261538900623360">I just heard about this crazy thing,and I hope not</a></p>
<p>So Kanye's crew knows about spirit cooking, and theres a lot of recent deep information coming down that he's having a hard time with. </p></p>

<p><p>Getting redpilled must be a traumatic experience when you realize that a lot of the people around you are heavily involved... It's traumatic for us  sitting at home... and we're anonymously  dealing with a bunch of strangers miles away... so being right in the middle of it must be truly shocking. </p></p>

<p><p>Kanye's a god. He's been persecuted by the establishment for his honesty his own career.</p>
<p>History's proven him right every single time.</p>
<p><strong>His "Controversies"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Speaking against homophobia. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking against the Bush botching Katrina and the media's biased reporting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking about rigged award shows and the lack of integrity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking against the heavily prejudiced elite fashion world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking against radio airtime being bought to push sales. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking against the censorship of other artists and suppression of artistic integrity
.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile his peers all profit heavily from selling out to the system. While he keeps fighting for integrity and honesty in society. He'd rather use his platform to better the world than fatten his pockets. </p>
<p>It's lucky there are enough people in the world that respect that enough to keep funding him but it requires incredibly bravery to fly against the face of all the corruption and slander. </p></p>

<p><p>he is being completely selfless.  he had a collaboration album in the works with Drake coming soon.  But recently, kanye's been like "fuck you, you're a puppet for the money".  Kanye would have RAKED it in with that album, but he chose to sacrifice that for his own integrity.  I have massive respect for Kanye</p></p>

<p><p>you reckon they've messed with his kids? Also, I find it hugely odd that kim K would actually get accosted without a BG plugging a dude. Absolutely no way they go out unescorted. Never mind that it wasn't captured on video. </p></p>

<p><p>I heard rumors a bodyguard was actually killed in the robbery and it was covered up... also rumors that it was ISIL that pulled off the robbery because France is infested with them. Could be a way to send a message... if we can take the ring off your wife's finger... we can take anything. Pure speculation on my part, but I wouldn't put it past anyone in these positions of power to orchestrate something nefarious like this.  </p></p>

<p><p>I thought the prevailing conspiracy theory (let's be honest, its all pretty conspiratorial right now) is that he's been mouthing off about being anti-establishment for months in celeb circles and the KimK attack was a warning sent to keep him shut up until after the election.</p>
<p>He seemed pretty afraid about an assassination attempt last night. </p></p>

<p><p>Don't put that evil on him. He's the hero the world needs. Fighting hard in a sea of corruption and filth in this industry.</p>
<p>He genuinely cares. That's what amazes me everytime. </p>
<p>No matter how hard he works to build something massive, he won't take the easy road and enjoy it. He'll hurt himself to help others.</p></p>

<p><p>eh, she is a performance artist. it is all a big spectacle, designed to offend.    Satan does not exist. Nor God.  the fact that people believe this nonsense (and so heavily steeped in their own religious beliefs to fear something like "satanism" .. when it is as harmless as the tooth fairy..a joke, just like the idea of "god")...this is what scares me. willful ignorance</p></p>

<p><p>You can't prove a negative.  </p>
<p>It is also on the people making a claim to provide evidence.  </p>
<p>And extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p>
<p>Extraordinary claims like, there is  a being who has the power to create and run a universe, know all things, cares for us, etc requires a lot of proof.  </p>
<p>If we motte and bailey it all the way back to a Deist god who kicked the whole thing off, but stays out of everything except where he is indistinguishable from chance, then the existence of god is indistinguishable from an agnostic atheism.</p></p>

<p><p>“One must state it plainly. Religion comes from the period of human prehistory where nobody—not even the mighty Democritus who concluded that all matter was made from atoms—had the smallest idea what was going on. It comes from the bawling and fearful infancy of our species, and is a babyish attempt to meet our inescapable demand for knowledge (as well as for comfort, reassurance and other infantile needs). Today the least educated of my children knows much more about the natural order than any of the founders of religion, and one would like to think—though the connection is not a fully demonstrable one—that this is why they seem so uninterested in sending fellow humans to hell.”</p></p>

<p><p>first thought i had was that he was a victim too?</p>
<p>this passage:
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(I saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris</p></p>

<p><p>Us living as we do upside-down
And the new word to have is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed
To continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often entered vagina
We learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom, free-DOOM
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names
That preceded, the bubblin' bubblin' bubblin' bubblin' bubblin'
In the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
"All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children, and some food to feed them every night"
After all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have you
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?</p></p>

<p><p>Hey guys, I dont want to swamp Corey Feldmen or Elijah wood with spam but if your a competent writer and good with words, could you take a few moments to draft up a paragraph or two asking them to speak further about the peadophilia in hollywood. Celebrity coverage would dramatically boost participation in this. They are easily contactable if you look around the net.  </p></p>

<p><p>Apparently he mentioned it at a concert the other day and then went on ranting about the establishment and how he hates Hillary. He said his manager had stopped him from talking about it until after the election ended.</p></p>

<p><p>Kanye is nowhere near broke, when he said he was 53 million dollars in debt he was talking about the amount of money he had put into his fashion line's latest season.</p></p>
