<strong>Beau Biden (son of Joe Biden) defended the judge who only gave a du Pont heir probation after admitting to sexually assaulting his three-year-old daughter</strong>
<p><p>Richards, 48, is the son of Robert H. Richards III and Mariana, daughter of Mariana DuPont Stillman. Since the 19th century the Du Pont family has been one of the richest families in America. The family fortune as of 2014 was $15 billion.</p>
<p>In 2009, Robert H. Richards IV entered a guilty plea and was convicted of raping his 3-year-old daughter. Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden later defended the sentencing of Richards to probation. Although Richards was ordered by Jurden to go through in-patient treatment at a Massachusetts facility, he has failed to do so.</p>

<p><p>Yeah I saw that, it was eye opening.  As you dig you see all of these convicted pedos getting off the hook through powerful people intervening.  </p>
<p>On a side note, there are so many cspan videos of Joe Biden acting like a complete creep around young women.  If we believe that this abuse is familial, the Biden family follows the rest of the narrative.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah, some one who knows more about audio analysis should verify what he says in that video.  So fucking weird.  Even if he didn't say anything, the fact that he is so grabby with young women in public is just gross -- imagine what he is like in private?!  Actually don't imagine, but you see what I mean.</p></p>

<p><p>If he was saying honored why was he whispering it in her ear?  Why wouldn't he just say it out loud.  I'm sure it would have made her parents proud hearing how honored he was.  It doesn't make sense and her reaction doesn't fit with being told its an honor.</p></p>

<p><p>He could have been talking about being honored but she's uncomfortable because an old guy who she either barely knows or doesn't know at all is whispering into her ear and leaning in for a kiss. I wouldn't care what someone was telling me, don't touch me and get close to me if I don't know you.</p></p>

<p><p>I think he intentionally told her directly; that makes sense to me -- when I was that age, I would interpret bringing my parents into the conversation as condescending 'kids table' talk. Personally, it's about the age where I felt the adolescent delusion of being 'old enough' to face anything, esp adult conversation. </p>
<p>If the VP told me directly he felt honored to be in my presence, I'd think he was being sincere, at least more so than if he'd felt instead compelled to feed me a nod-of-acknowledgement through my parents. And she just seems like a nervous, shy child -- nothing about her behavior seems unnatural, given the attention and chaotic environment that I'm sure she doesn't deal with daily.</p>
<p>I <em>really</em> don't buy the 'horny' bit. There's plenty of media around capturing the moment, and although I'm willing to eat my words, I hear "honored" </p>
<p>...which makes sense to me.</p></p>

<p><p>The caption had me sold until I considered that he was saying "honored", and I'm pretty that's the case.  As for the "talk to my daughter ashley about the film", I think that was just an interpretation of the combined background chatter.  One person very clearly says, "can I shake your hand?"  and I think the I-shake part sounded like Ashley. </p></p>

<p>IIRC, Biden's other son Hunter was kicked out of the Navy Reserves for doing cocaine a few years back. Weird...</p></p>

<p>Leelah Alcorn, who was 17, walked into the path of the tractor-trailer in the wee hours of 28 December. She had left a handwritten note on her bed – “I’ve had enough” – and had done an online search about runaway assistance and a Tumblr search for the word “suicide” before walking on to Interstate 71 in suburban Cincinnati, according to a patrol report released on Wednesday.

<p>Literally vomit-inducing. This scum gets to hide in his house and live off wealth he didn't help create? Un-fucking-real.</p></p>

<p><p>I also advise people with free time to go back to the email leaks. Start combing through them from the beginning. I am sure we missed something because everyone was focusing on finding something else. Now that we have a list of suspects, organizations, businesses and strange handkerchief code talk. I am sure there is some emails we might have overlooked. </p></p>

<p><p>Reddit arm-chair prosecutors and detectives at it again. This is a preferable outcome to letting the fuck get away with it and NOT face any repercussions after he inevitably would have drained the system of resources at trial. Just because Beau stood by the prosecutors decision to weight the options and label this guy a sex offender for the rest of his life vs seeing him get off Scott free does not equal Bidens are pedophiles! </p>
<p>The only thing I've seen on here that lends some credibility is ale fontis's creepy instagram feed and the logos. Circumstantial tangential evidence hunter circle jerk at its worst. You guys draw bad inferences on the whim of "duck duck go" searches. This isn't how real investigators build a case. Leave it to the professionals and stop spreading innuendo and false info, it's not helping your cause.</p>
<p>"In recognition of the weakness of the case, the assigned prosecutor offered a plea and sentence recommendation that guaranteed the defendant would be required to register as a sex offender, participate in court-ordered sex offender rehabilitation therapy and to have no contact with the victim and any other child under the age of 16," Biden wrote. "A loss at trial would have rendered any of these restrictions impossible."</p></p>

<p><p>Obviously you haven't seen the footage of Joe Biden at the swearing in of Senators. 
I couldn't tell what Joe said in the one girls ear but his actions towards the young female family members of those being sworn in is beyond creepy. </p></p>

<p><p>This sub goes off the deep end when bits of /r/TheDonald come out strong.</p>
<p>I've seen posts like "oh he's anti-Trump, so he must be involved in this all" and a CSPAN video of Biden touching girls' shoulders in a staged photo shot apparently meaning he's a pedophile.</p>
<p>If this sub actually wants to be more than a relic then the focus needs to be on Alefantis and the Podesta brothers, who have actual links.</p>
<p>The "every Democrat is a criminal" ideology reflected by so many posters here significantly deters progress and outsiders taking this sub more seriously than just another pro-Trump connection.</p>
<p>This is going nowhere if it appears politically motivated by the alt-right.</p></p>

<p><p>Well-said. It's refreshing to see I'm not the only one on here that's grabbed his pitchfork in anticipation of some paradigm shift just because a billionaire (who himself has connections to all of these entities, BTW) convinced everyone he's going to MAGA. </p></p>

<p>I'd agree with that statement. Did I say he was a pedo? Perhaps you replied to the wrong comment? Let me break down my comment for you...</p>
<p>My quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>national model in going after child predators</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your reply (which is also a quote):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>required to register as a sex offender, participate in court-ordered sex offender rehabilitation therapy and to have no contact with the victim and any other child under the age of 16</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does the punishment fit the crime? My opinion is if <em>this</em> is the national model in going after these predators, then we are in big trouble. Fair to say?</p></p>

<p><p>Delaware is involved in this somehow. I know it. I live in Rehoboth Beach, DE. DuPont is based out of Delaware, we have super loose tax laws and A few years ago, David Brock had to sell his home in the area to pay off William Grey in that lawsuit. Rehoboth is a "family oriented" beach resort with a large gay community. Lots of old gay dudes with lots of money, lots of kids running around the boardwalk, and LOTS of houses that are vacant for most of the year. The biggest name pizza place in Delaware is grotto pizza and they're logo is a clockwise swirl. I'm probably just being paranoid about the pizza place but there is some hinky stuff going on here. I don't even know where to start digging. </p></p>

<p><p>Clockwise swirl plus the fan photo page has <a href="http://www.grottopizza.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Girl_Dog_Grotto_Patio.jpg">this</a> which has nothing to do with pizza, and especially <a href="http://www.grottopizza.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Peter_Beach_Grotto.jpg">this.</a></p>
<p>In light of everything that's been going on that picture is super suspicious. It's the only one that has been cropped, with the clockwise swirls, and is a close up of a young boy's face. </p></p>

<p><p>I'm not ready to admit this is going on in my own backyard and no one notices. This is a small town, we'd know if one kid went missing, let alone a pattern of kids missing during tourist season. If they aren't nabbing these kids, where are they getting them? </p></p>

<p><p>Won't have much time to search, and I couldn't find much on Biden/comet. But searching "Biden comet ping pong" on duckduckgo showed me a facebook connection. It's a female, works in DC. Two of her "liked pages" are The Beau Biden Foundation for Protection of Children and also Comet Ping Pong. She's also facebook friends with Alefantis. No idea who this lady is though. I'm also not tech savy. If someone could jump on this and archive everything that would be much appreciated.</p></p>

<p>Buck’s Fishing &amp; Camping
5031 Connecticut Ave., NW
It might have a location away from the heart of DC, but Vickie Reh’s outdoorsy, nature-inspired restaurant has hosted an unexpected variety of hungry celebrities, from Robert Redford and Jon Bon Jovi to chef and food activist Alice Waters. No word on whether any visiting VIPs have ducked into Comet Ping Pong, a few doors down, for after-dinner entertainment.</p></p>
