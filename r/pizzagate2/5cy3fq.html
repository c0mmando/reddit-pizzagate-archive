<p><p>Good to clear up dead ends so we can focus on other things.</p>
<p>Stratfor is still creepy and dangerous outside of this topic though.</p></p>

<p><p>The document looks to be on the level... I don't see anything too sketchy going on in there... It could be related to Jeff Bezo's "two pizza rule" cause it looks like they are trying to resolve the issue of too many member category types having conflicting opinions about the CC page of their website. </p></p>

<p><p>It's certainly a worthy endeavor to research who is buying this intel and what companies they work for that will be using it. But as far as I can tell, none of our key players are listed in this and will not likely help further this case.</p></p>

<p><p>Plus... I just started opening my curtains again... I'll poke a stick at Pizza Pipeline, but I feel like Stratfor is a beast above my paygrade.  </p></p>

<p><p>I wouldn't be so sure of that. Currently following some leads that come back to this very possibly involving an alphabet agency starting with C. Not enough info yet to say for sure yet.</p>
<p>If you think Stratfor is scary, then you should know that this will make Stratfor's scope look like a fly on an elephants ass. The breadth of this case is astonishing. Myself and a few others haven't posted a lot of this info yet.</p></p>

<p><p>I knew something was up when the construction crew posted up outside my house for the last month had their level mounted on a Leica tripod. </p></p>

<p><p>Could they be buying kiddie porn on their "pizza website?" Why is stratfor involved? I know comet pizza has a hidden login section and I remember a screen shot of a conversation asking for slices of pizza and needing fresh slices 8-14 or something.</p></p>
