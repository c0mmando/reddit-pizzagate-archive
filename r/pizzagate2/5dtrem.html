<p><p>Just so everyone knows, those are two women who were investigating sexual trafficking in North Korea. Bill Clinton personally flew there and brought them back to the US.</p>

<p><p>Repost because I don't think anyone saw my comment:</p>
<p>I think this one might be out of context. Euna Lee and Laura Ling (the two women) were detained in North Korea. This email was sent a few days after they were released from custody by the North Koreans and arrived home. </p>
<p>They arrived in the States August 5th, 2009. This email was sent August 8th, 2009. </p>
<p>It could be that the Podesta's were just glad to see them safe and sound on American soil, eating pizza and having a good time after being prisoners in North Korea.</p>
<p>Also: the child in the photo is likely Euna Lee's daughter. http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-4861965,width-640,resizemode-4/freed-us-journalist-euna-lee-holds-her-daughter.jpg</p>

<p><p>I think this one might be out of context.

They arrived in the States August 5th, 2009.

It could be that the Podesta's were just glad to see them safe and sound on American soil, eating pizza and having a good time after being prisoners in North Korea.</p>
<p>Also: the child in the photo is likely Euna Lee's daughter.

<p><p>I recall reading this story as you describe it.</p>
<p>Is there anyway to verify these ladies are journalists?  For whom do they work?</p>
<p>Edit typo (his --&gt; this)</p>
<p>Edit: Current TV was an American television channel from August 1, 2005 to August 20, 2013. Al Gore, Joel Hyatt, and Ronald Burkle each held a sizable stake in Current. Comcast and DirecTV each held a smaller stake.</p></p>
