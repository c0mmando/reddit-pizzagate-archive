<p><blockquote>
<p>Up to 300,000 Americans under 18 are lured into the commercial sex trade every year </p>
<p>$32 billion-a-year industry, human trafficking is on the rise and is in all 50 states.</p>
<p>Trafficking will surpass the illegal sale of drugs in the next few years  </p>
<p>Average victims age is 11 to 14 
 The largest group of at-risk children are runaway, thrown away, or homeless American children who use survival sex to acquire food, shelter, clothing, and other things needed to survive on America's streets. According to the National Runaway Switchboard  1.3 million runaway and homeless youth live on America's streets every day. [5,000 die each year] It would not be surprising to learn that the number of children trafficked in the United States is actually much higher than 300,000 </p>
<p>Children are often targeted by traffickers as they are deemed easier to manipulate than adults. More money can be earned by younger girls and boys exploited in sexual exploitation, especially virgins. Pre-pubescent girls are reported to be injected with hormones to bring on puberty. Younger girls are expected to have a greater earning potential, and as such are in greater demand. </p>
