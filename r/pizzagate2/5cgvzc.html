<p><p>I came to this sub specifically to ask a question about this e-mail, so I'm glad it's right up top. </p>
<p>Where are people getting hot tub from?  I have scoured that document, I even ctrl-f it, but I can not find hot tub used once in it.  Can someone fill me in?</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah but a heated pool isn't a hot tub.  It's a real thing, that isn't even hot tub like.  Why is everyone insisting on saying hot tub?  Because it sounds more nefarious?</p></p>

<p><p>No because the act of describing a party with a body of water, with childrem5 7 and 8 or whatever is nefarious in itself and worth wondering about</p></p>

<p><p>Why be deceptive and call it a hot tub party, and not a pool party as it actually was?  I honestly don't get it.</p>
<p>I suspect it has to do with the fact that having a hot tub party with children present is much scarier sounding then having a pool party with kids present.</p></p>

<p><p>Yes of course but they called it a "pool party" for that reason. So when someone read their email they could use the excuse you are using.
Really it isn't about bathing with the kids, this is most likely meeting to move the kids.
Its all code
And maybe it is just a happy little pool party. Either way it's our right to explore their motives.</p></p>

<p><p>Of course it's your right to investigate if you believe something nefarious is taking place.  That's why I came here, I saw a best of post, and came to see fir myself what this was all about.</p>
<p>I do agree that there is a LOT of weirdness going on in this whole deal, but the people investigating it are doing themselves and the investigation a disservice by throwing their own sensationalistic spin on everything.  If "pool party" gets changed to "hot tub party" just because the latter seems more nefarious, and brings with it a darker mental image then how am I suppose to take any of the conclusions seriously?</p>
<p>An investigation is suppose to contain no bias, and solely focus on the facts at hand.  Once those facts no matter how small begin to twist in order to make it better fit the narrative the investigator has already determined then the whole case begins to lean toward one conclusion, and away from the facts as presented.</p>
<p>The email is definitely weird, and whether or not it was a pool or hot tub party doesn't matter as vile activity are certainly possible during both.  My issue is with the investigators trying to make the story more sensational which only causes others to spew it mindlessly all over the place.  </p></p>

<p><p>Again, not seemingly related, but on Alefaggot's instagram there was an image of a van (white though) which had text saying: "like plywood but like concrete' with some boards in side the back (sound proofing).
