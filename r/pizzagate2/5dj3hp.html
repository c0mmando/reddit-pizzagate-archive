<p><p>He may or may not be connected in regards to Pedowood. But we don't have a direct connection. We can't just throw darts at the board and hope it sticks.</p></p>

<p><p>I completely agree, however I think connections are made by inquiring about potential connections.  That is why I labeled this SPECULATION.  I reiterate I completely agree.  It was curious how when I searched for "james alefantis kevin spacey" you get pictures of john podesta, david brock, hillary clinton.  Anyway if someone has had the same hunch or found something else related (thumbs up)</p></p>

<p><p>No, but the only exposure to it that I have are reviews, where they say things like "A sexually frustrated suburban father has a mid-life crisis after becoming infatuated with his daughter's best friend." -IMDB</p>
<p>I know that from reading the reviews he uses it as a catalyst to make changes in his life, and that his character never acts out on his infatuation.  I think this mirrors, the low-orbit of Anthony Wiener, and Huma Abedin in regard to Hillary Clinton.  </p>
<p>Finally the first and foremost word of this post is SPECULATION.</p></p>
