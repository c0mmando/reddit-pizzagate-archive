<strong>Hi, I am the guy (guy #2) that hacked wethepizza.com and stole the 2GB of data</strong>
<p><p>Hi, first off let me apologize for the first guy... I told him to not go public yet, but he disobeyed my wishes and wanted the government to know we have 1 or more deadman switches currently operating (we DO have multiple). I was not ready to go public, so let me clear up some mis (or dis) information about the wethepizza.com. He was going to be our PR guy since he knows a lot about IT, but I really wanted him to explain things in layman's terms to the press. He isn't responding to any of my messages so I am worried about him, hopefully he is just very drunk and asleep.</p>
<p>There was no hacking involved, an anonymous friend who works for an anonymous 3 letter agency tipped me off and I obtained all pedo data from We The Pizza via old fashion social engineering. I made a fake phone call and 3 hours latter I walked out the door with over 2GB of sensitive pedo information on a USB drive. </p>
<p><strong>I will be uploading the encrypted client list within 2 hours.</strong> After I verify it has nothing to phone home with and harm YOU.</p>
<p>I have determined with the timestamps and GPS locations (yes, I have the GPS locations in some the photos of the children being raped at home), that the 2GB of child rape porn was probably for pedos in high powered positions who were involved, were forced to upload their own images with GPS coordinates (for blackmailing, or to make sure they always shut the fuck up about what they were doing). I would say 70% are videos/photos of children being raped at a home, and the other 30% are some kind of professional sex slave brothel (everything is stainless steel, etc). Some are truly horrifying, at one of the brothels, I watched a child being amputated while alive and fully aware. Sickening. </p>
<p>We had not decided on how to go public yet and we were still planning, so his original thread contained some misinformation I told him to include to throw the feds off the scent, but he lost his fucking mind and revealed the goddamn site and posted the child rape evidence and my face is on the CCTV walking out the front door. I don't expect to live. If you believe in a god pray for me. I am in hiding. I will communicate until I am killed.</p>
<p>As 100% proof we are legit and not lying, go to wethepizza.com They already took down their website. GUILTY! We were investigating ties to Saudi Arabia and other intelligence agencies with my intelligence friend. They have locations in Saudi Arabia, close to CIA headquarters and Washington DC. </p>

<p><p>If original OP <em>knows a lot about IT</em>, then he never would've linked the entire subreddit to <strong>actual CP</strong>. Sorry but I can't buy that. Everyone who clicked that shit is now in danger of going to prison. Anyone who knows anything about.. well, anything at all, would never have provided a direct link to actual CP unless they were trying to bait people into downloading incriminating photos that could put people in prison.</p>
<p>Edit: as a precaution, when OP links whatever he's going to link "in two hours", do not click on it until someone you trust from this sub has checked it out first and for their safety I hope they're using the correct safety measures. Everyone needs to keep in mind that this stuff originally started with the Clinton Killing Machine and it most likely involves every level of the United States government including all of the alphabet agencies. We may be smart but they are <strong>very</strong> technically advanced. They know how to catch people and they know how to properly deploy a honeypot. Be careful.</p></p>

<p>I've worked as a consultant in the tech industry and have met my fair share of IT/dev people, and I can tell you right now that you're giving them way too much credit. It's not the easiest job in the world and it does require a lot of domain-specific-knowledge, but <strong>job titles mean shit</strong> when it comes to street smarts. </p>
<p>A vast majority of these people <em>are not</em> uber smart 1337 hax0rs like people might imagine. I've encountered some that are hardly even more technologically 'savvy' than my parents! The bar isn't set very high, because that's just how much demand there is for people with even rudimentary IT knowledge. It's largely just a bunch of average dudes doing it to put food on the table.  You'd be lucky to run into a place with a staff as skilled as the one on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0487831/">The IT Crowd</a>.</p></p>

<p><p>Well if that's the logic we're gonna roll with then that just proves my point even further that no one should click any links these people provide under any circumstance. OP said his friend who posted the CP is "good with IT" so the burden of proof is on him.</p></p>

<p><p>Obviously, nobody's disputing where the burden of proof is. However calling bullshit on OP just for his questionable judge of character is ridiculous. If you're gonna call bs, call it when he doesn't deliver on what he said he would, and as of now he still has a bit of time on the clock.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm sorry but I'm gonna call bullshit on <em>anyone</em> who links actual CP to over 18,000 people. Even if it turns out to not be a honeypot, I can't think of a better definition of a honeypot. No one can verify whether or not those photos came from WeThePizza without downloading them and if you download them, then the FBI has every reason to put you in prison.</p></p>

<p><p>I take it you're a lawyer then, since you seem to confidently know about how the laws work surrounding all this?</p>
<p>If people know what they're doing and they take appropriate precautions (e.g. vpn+tor on a public/cellular connection, running off a kali linux live cd), there's little need for going so overboard with all the needless fear mongering and concern trolling. </p>
<p>People stupid enough to download cp on their everyday home pc without any protection had to have already waded through a ton of loud warnings in here to even find that shit anyway, so I don't see your point. Besides, it's obvious the pedos themselves get away with it all the time without getting caught, so it's not impossible. These are Facts.</p></p>

<p><p>Arguing with me is pointless. Go look at OP's second thread. You can't "bruteforce" PGP and he's in there telling people to bruteforce it. This is a honeypot. Everyone trying to crack the shit OP put in that second thread is now probably on an FBI list. You don't get to accuse me of concern trolling when I'm telling people not to click on a suspected honeypot. There is a difference between concern trolling and trying to inform people that if they click on this fool's bullshit they're probably going to prison. I realize people in here know to be careful but you can't count on 18,000+ people to all be as cautious as the most cautious person. I guarantee someone clicked the CP link without thinking about what that might entail.</p></p>

<p><p>Don't get me wrong, I agree with you in <em>principle</em>, or your sentiment rather. </p>
<p>But right now, the only people who would even fall for this honeypot are the same kind of people who would actually know how to hide themselves fairly well regardless. Even attempting to crack a PGP key is beyond some casual 'poweruser' task, and you would think the whole goal of a honeypot like this would be to get as many people as possible in order to shut them up. That's not even taking into consideration the fact that you don't even need to be connected to a network to brute force a crypto key, thus making it a really poor/inefficient way of collecting people's data.</p>
<p>So either this is the shittiest honeypot and half-assed cover story in the history of government intelligence, or it's all just some dudes fumbling around and getting in way over their head. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Halon's razor</a> and mathematical probability suggest it's most likely the latter. Could still be a troll, but I wouldn't suspect they have much legal power if this is how they're approaching their scheme.</p></p>

<p><p>Exactly, also being good at IT ≠ being good at opsec or netsec.  </p>

<p><p>People kept asking for proof and he provided, it's good to remain skeptical but OP here is saying the encrypted client list will be uploaded, also providing extra information about the gps coordinates which would make sense if this is also used for blackmail. It could be fake or real, I honestly have no fucking idea what to believe at this point, just gonna wait and see if OP delivers. </p>
<p>I'm sure that if real, these pictures and videos are sick enough to cause you to lose your mind. Best of luck OP, even if this isn't real, these "Hostel" style brothels do exist and attention needs to be brought to the dark shit that goes on in the shadows.</p></p>

<p><p>Still, is there proof that he obtained this evidence FROM the pizza place? Or through whatever connection he had with them? Otherwise he is just calling the police on himself and reporting his own possession of CP</p></p>

<p><p>I agree that this is probably legit, but on the flipside caution is warranted as this could be a clever trap too. Get all of the people investigating here to download CP, then van them or at least have the sub shutdown for "CP" propagation.</p>
<p>So I highly advise that people dig into this ONLY with the proper protection (VPN+For), saving copies is advisable but do not keep them in your home and I advise against viewing any alleged illegal pornographic material. Be aware that it is illegal to possess these files even for legitimate purposes, so don't be foolish about this.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah I definitely recommend against downloading things, seems pretty easy to pin a CP charge on someone. I'd also be weary of trusting TOR too much but yeah the main thing is don't download sketchy links that may contain CP.</p></p>

<p><p>Okay, I can see how that looks horrible. but in my mind I think of it like this: If he actually does have evidence of a MASSIVE government endorsed pedo ring encompassing multiple levels of gov. and multiple agencies....I too would need a drink, or 5.</p></p>

<p><p>Wasn't We the Pizza mentioned specifically in some "leaked" (possibly faked) Correct the Record strategy online conversation? Something about how the staff was tired of getting takeout from there but that it was David Brock's favorite place?</p></p>

<p><p>There was a Reddit Post like 4 yrs ago talking about setting up a "pizza lovers" club or some wierd shit. There was a couple people talking about getting together, as strangers, once a week, to go out for pizza. Comet pizza GM involved in the conversations and the place they decided to go first was We the Pizza. </p></p>

<p><p>Yeah... I just ignored the OP and dug into the company themselves... leads right back to Capitol Hill in so many ways... then off to Haiti... hell even runs into Trump kicking a restaurant out of one of his hotels. You can check my recent post history if you want to see what I've turned up. </p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/59231</p>
<p>Don't forget to run new leads thru wikileaks for hits we overlooked previously.  </p>
<p>edit - damn... and another link to Big Brothers, Big Sisters... the office near me was unloading stuff into a Ryder truck a couple days ago. </p>
<p>Hasn't Genentech been implicated before? I know I've heard them brought up... and oddly enough this is my 5th run in with Ben &amp; Jerrys... but I gotta remember that a lot of honest and good people are inadvertently and unknowingly wrapped up in this. </p>

<p>I'm not digging too much into it myself.  But yeah.  It's a brain disease that comes from a tradition of funeral cannibalism.</p>
<p>And apparently CF is all around the place.  FBIanon told us to look into the Foundation and notice that it sets up in places with terrible birth records.  Because human trafficking.</p>

<p><p>This depends on individuals leaking info. Just get the info spread to people with access or power in some way. The more individuals who know, more info gets out and more credible this fiasco becomes. </p>

<p><p>We've gotten this far by agencies/hackers/foreign affiliates having leaked this stuff.  This sorta stuff wasn't done by computers, there are people behind these screens.  I'm hoping/expecting someone to seriously go kamikaze and outs some of these big names with concrete evidence.   Saw your post and like how you owned up to the possibility of being wrong, which is admirable and wish more carried that trait.  Just wanted to say!</p></p>

<p>If I had unknowingly used a logo that incorporated a symbol for pedophilia, I would change it immediately as soon as that was drawn to my attention, because I wouldn't want to be wrongly associated with that filth.</p></p>

<p><p>I mean yeah if you are totally innocent but this dude has tons of pics of little kids and pedophile references on his Instagram (now private, but archived). I just don't see how you can make pedophile references and then coincidently have a pedophile symbol in your logo. My mind won't let me change my stance on this as much as I'd like to believe his innocence. I hope it was just a mistake in design but being a graphic designer myself, I know what symbols to avoid..</p></p>

<p><p>The guy with the paedophilic photos and coments in his instagram is the owner of Comet Ping Pong Pizza (James Alefantis), not the owner of Besta Pizza (Andrew Kline). They are afew buildings apart and may be related, but afaik nothing too shady connecting to Andrew Kline (except his Besta Pizza's logo) came up till now.</p></p>

<p><p>The lines coming out of pizza are same as lines from Crowley's satanic star. Just sayin... Lots of "coincidences" to have accidentally appear. Circumstantial evidence is what is used in the majority of court cases. Totality of evidence, not cherry picked evidence. </p></p>

<p><p>Ok, seriously, somebody has got to find a better way to present all this info. Graphics like this scream "crazy conspiracy nut!" To any regular person.  </p>
<p>Write it up in a Word or Google Doc or something, as if it was an article or essay. Include photos when needed, but rely on text paragraphs to convey the majority of the message. </p>
<p>If this sub is going to be the "journalists" that bring this issue to the public, then you're going to have to present the information in a way that looks similar to real news, if you want people to entertain the possibility of its credibility. Pretend you really are a journalist.</p></p>

<p><p>I don't claim to be a journalist or anything, this is just a temporary thing I made to make the connections that we found available to eveybody. The link between WeThePizza and Andrew Kline is there and was already explained countless times, but the CP found on their website is bullshit so this infographic is not even accurate anymore. And English is my fourth language so I don't really feel comfortable writing up information in a "journalistic" manner.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah I tend to agree, but the advantage of this sort of presentation is that it's easier for people to understand and it's easier to share (for example on 4chan or 8ch) because it's in a picture format. The point of this is just to raise awareness so that people can properly do their own research afterwards</p></p>

<p><p>I look at it all this way:  the best case scenario to this whole conspiracy is NOT that we catch them; the best case scenario is actually that we are all WRONG and that there is no conspiracy.  Every single time we are lied to/somebody LARPs, it is almost a success in a way.</p>
<p>I wouldn't call all of this wasted time; it is entertainment in a way.  Exercising our brains, working together as a community, solving problems and trying to defy odds when everything is stacked against you.  Its all good shit.  Pray that we are wrong, but dig as if we are right</p></p>

<p><p>I think these topics were made by someone that definitely knows something is afoot at wethepizza... but can't get people to rally to investigate. I know the same feeling... I can't get any traction behind looking into "Pizza Pipeline". I think the story is bullshit... but for the right reasons. We need to look at things other than Comet/Besta. This is nationwide... Hell... I've linked pizzagate to 9/11 terrorists and still... OMG COMET PING PONG! Is the prevailing interest of 99% of pizzagate people. </p></p>

<p><p>I'm not sure about technical vocab but the website looks more "hacked" than "down". What I mean is you can still have access to the website but it looks like the hacks than kids do to "troll" by putting gifs or shit like that instead of the actual website, because of the "coming soon" and "watch this space" msgs. Doesn't look like what the owner of the website would do but more like a prank, but it's hard to tell with nothing.</p>
<p>Also what's wrong with my account lol</p></p>

<p>You have nearly a year old account with no usage until one month ago. Nothing wrong with it, per se. But you're not trustworthy. Least of all when you come in here trying to discredit OP with no original contribution or evidence. </p>

<p>You're right. It's not down. That would actually be less sketchy because it would be explained easily by a DDOS attack or just a shit ton of traffic. But whoever manages this website took down the entire UI and replaced it with a simple "Under Construction" / "Coming Soon" message. It doesn't look a hack at all. What hackers would do that? Why is the admin space still available? </p></p>

<p><p>I don't remeber why I created the account the first time but I started using it lastly because I started posting in a mobile game thread you can check. Also I 'm french so don't think I could hardly be related to all this shit. I'm here from a french forum where they were talking about this so I just gave my opinion about it</p>
<p>And I don't know about what is an UI and an admin space, is it linked to the information available in the website database ? </p></p>

<p>That's 1% proof. Maybe you hacked the entire server and replaced the website's contents with this HTML that we see now. It's Sunday. It will he hours before the actual owner can react. </p>
<p><em>Most important question nobody is rising</em>: what does a website have to do with the place one stores documents? Small businesses don't run their web servers on their own computers. This is the case here. </p>
<p>If the pizza place were to store documents, it would be in the pizza place, not on the server that is somewhere in Texas (if I remember correctly).</p></p>

<p><p>Convenience? Storing documents on 'the cloud' isn't exactly uncommon or new. If they try to conduct 'business' from elsewhere, they'll need to have their stuff up somewhere online where the can access it. </p>
<p>And at that point, which do you think is a safer convenient option for them: to put all their transaction logs and 'products' up on google docs/dropbox, or on a slightly more private server that they pay for?</p>
<p>Everyone's acting like these people are genius technologically gifted criminal masterminds, yet the thing that <em>sparked this whole investigation in the first place</em> was a poorly secured email server that got utterly hacked several times. And that's from people that had waaay more incentive to secure their shit than people running a damn pizza joint.</p></p>

<p><p>A couple different pizza places had strange parts of their websites that required either a login, or many different passwords for different file downloads. I'm guessing that's what OP stumbled onto.</p>
<p>If this is the format that these businesses use to operate (accessing a special part of the website w a login or password) then what OP is saying makes sense.</p></p>

<p><p>Maybe there's decent people in these agencies who have their hands tied and are willing to pursue leads through other means to expose this?  You know once this gets so big, at some point there will be people that will have stronger moral fortitude than all the money, fear, or power in the world can buy.  </p>
<p>The cracks appear, and soon the entire house of cards will come down.</p></p>

<p><p>that's my hope as well.  it could be that the opportunity to safely leak only became an option when ~2000 eyes would definitely be on it at the moment of release.  Either that or it's all a ruse to shut the whole sub down.  So stressful!!</p></p>

<p><p>To be honest, the people at the building where the supposed OP claims he went would have already checked the tapes I assume. Their site being "coming soon" mode proves that the back end is aware of some sort of leak, or something related to this. It did not just change for no reason, ya know?</p>
<p>Also: I've been following this since the first thread. The only thing we can really do is wait for proof. I do not know what to think, as it's all unverified (sort of). </p>
<p>The suspense though, is palpable. </p></p>

<p><blockquote>
<p>Also, why would you say publicly here that you've physically been there and walked out with the data?</p>

<p>Because he knows that THEY know who he is. His only chance of safety from the people who kill people in order to cover this all up, is to let the public at large know that he needs to be protected. Does it make sense? No. And when was the last time a person who was busy panicking made sense? </p>
<p>It's pretty rare. </p></p>

<p><p>OP, idk. I feel like you guys are changing your story. Other guy said he hacked a poorly protected WiFi network, and you're saying it was social engineering. </p>
<p>At this point, if you release the client list, you'll be believed. But until you do, it looks like you're just dragging out a troll</p>
<p>If you're really in hiding, good luck. I /will/ pray for you.</p></p>

<p><p>No no, it's totally normal for a pizza 'chef' to have connections with some of the most powerful people in the world.  I mean, we all know how only the most well trained and groomed chefs can make the complicated dish that is pizza!</p>
<p>Also, who doesn't go vacationing in Saudi Arabia?  I know I do!  Nothing takes a load off like suppression of civil rights in a desert country run by oil dictators!  </p>

<p><p>Seems like they would block referrals to their boards and not so much the image files... if they wanted to keep redditors out... But I don't know much about this... Just know I haven't seen it before. </p>
<p>I'm surprised that tptb haven't busted Captcha in order to sabotage 4chan. </p></p>

<p><p>original post by hacker #1:</p>
<p>Just going to paste his Reddit post here. Spread the FUCKING word.</p>
<p>"Hi, I am quickly posting this from a random open wifi so I will only will be available for questions about how to PROPERLY LEAK THIS only for 30 minutes for OPSEC reasons.</p>
<p>Let's make it quick with the questions, long story short: I cracked into a suspicious "pizza/family center" and their netsec was shit. I made off with an encrypted list of their clients, and 2GB of unencrypted videos, which after glancing at the site's source code, there was a hidden login that allowed you to view "actives, services, and pricing" after logging in, the videos/photos were under the "activities" and "services" page. Not sure if they are aware of my intrusion, so not listing the site yet.</p>
<p>So here is what I have, and how should I leak it?:</p>
<p>2GB of brutal videos and photos of little boys and girls being raped. ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING TO WATCH!!!!!</p>
<p>An unencrypted spreadsheet of the pricing for each act (rape $10,000, minor torture $35,000, severe torture $100,000 and murder $250,000). Prices were different based on if the victim was a boy, girl, white, black, and age etc.</p>
<p>And I have an encrypted list of all their clients.</p>
<p>Okay guys, how should I leak this? Should I just post the child porn? Is that even fucking legal? I feel I should submit this to the FBI but I DO NOT TRUST THEM and I have a strong feeling wikileaks is compromised as well. And if I don't login within 24hours tell my family I loved them.</p>
<p>FBI/CIA/NSA/LE/YOU EVIL MOTHERFUCKERS: I HAVE A DEADMAN SWITCH SETUP, IF I DON'T RESET MY SWITCH ONCE EVERY 12 HOURS IT ALL GETS RELEASED ON AN .ONION AND .I2P AND ALL THE LINKS GETS POSTED TO OVER 100 SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. AND I THINK SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS FACES ARE IN THE VIDEOS, SO DON'T TRY ANYTHING STUPID. "</p></p>

<p><p>Friendly reminder to all people researching this issue that possession, distribution (in some cases mere access) to child pornography is most likely a crime in your regions.  I would strongly advise everyone to research their local laws and at no time to knowingly access, transmit or collect illegal material of this nature.</p></p>

<p><p>I want to believe you have caught these sick fucks, but you've basically just told us who your source was, how you obtained the thumbdrive and where you obtained it from.
You seem angry about how much information your partner divulged, yet here you are spilling beans like it's a cowboy camp.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you proceed to tell us that they would have your face on CCTV, knowing full well that "they," are probably reading this.</p>
<p>I would have gave you 0% authenticity, only for the fact that <a href="http://wethepizza.com">wethepizza.com</a> is down.
Because, right now, that's the only solid piece of evidence that has been verifiable.</p>
<p>What I can't comprehend is why you haven't leaked the client and price list.
That alone would be solid evidence; solid evidence that could be decrypted by knowledgeable people, not just yourselves.</p>
<p>If you want to let the truth out, give us the encrypted file, otherwise this is as fake as wikileaks recent tweets.</p></p>

<p><p>Lol, what else can you do?  You cant fly out of the country.  You could go by foot, but you wont get far.  Cant stay at your residence.</p>
<p>Best bet would be to steal a car or use a friend's car and just DRIVE.  Unless you have a safe house.  But the feds would interrogate anybody who knows you.  There arent many options - what would you do?</p></p>

<p><p>I gave this a lot of thought. I even bought a beat down old motorhome and a crappy little second house. I figured if I was going to flee, I'd like to have a place to live in or in which to hide. BUT the truth is you can't hide. If they want to find you, you are going to get caught. But maybe you are better at fleeing than I am. </p>
<p>I decided my best chance was to shelter in place and to fight them from where I am. I fight them with words and ideas. It is a battle for hearts and minds. </p>
<p>Edit: crappy spelling. </p></p>

<p><p>It means they obtained an encrypted list, it means nothing at all if it's encrypted strongly.  It may be a shitty excel encryption or something we may be able to break or brute force.  Then...this could mean a lot. A whole lot.  We need the pricing list, and even the encrypted file to start hacking on asap.</p></p>

<p><p>If true, OP must have a lot of cash and be a high class citizen. I doubt I could find that kind of shit just by making a quick phone call and walking into a pizza place.</p>
<p>OP did say they had a tip from a 3 letter agency though, so I guess if they do have the right connections it's a possibility.</p></p>

<p><p>Actually this is more than possible. Like you I would not have believed it before. I'm just now putting things I knew together with this. I explained in my other post here and will not say more. This was something I figured out, not something I was told....but based on what I was told...a three letter agency helping is not out of the realm of possibility because they cannot do anything without...risking all. These agencies in question have eaten their own...and will eat their own to keep this secret. At this point I think they'd do anything...and I do mean that.</p></p>

<p><p>So, does that mean without the other piece to the key, we are left without access to the file ? (I am under the impression that the file that's encrypted is a list of clients, if OP is telling the truth) So we essentially cannot ever confirm what he is saying without the other key ?</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah, according to a few /pol/ peeps, it's impossible without the private part of the key.</p></p>

<p><p>I had not been to this sub for a few days. I've been thinking and thinking about what I did learn...and I kept thinking there had to be more to it...if someone could be so easily eaten...that had impeccable reputation. This person would NEVER compromise me by telling me more...at first I thought it was just a "local" incidence but I just kept thinking there was more not said. It seemed a bit over the top kind of attack for something merely local. Reading here has really made me think WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?</p>
<p>Literally if you were a good guy on the inside and you tried to do something...you would find yourself behind bars. It's not the little guys, they have no idea, they just make arrests...evidence is..injected so to speak. If it were not for a federal judge disbelieving the story...still it took three years.</p>
<p>Now look at who DV me...and there's your answer.</p></p>

<p><p>Yes...it would. As I said on a different post I am literally a no body who has a reputation for strong ethics and integrity...but has also widely traveled and due to some aspects of myself people tell me things. Over the last ten years I've literally been in some of the most interesting situations...and this thing happened, then that thing...then this thing, then that thing...and as I sit here reflecting back the bits fall together...probably very few people have had the opportunities I have had to be in such vastly different situations...in some ways I feel like that crazy meme with the crime board and all the red lines leading from one thing to the next. I've revisited a few things here recently and putting together things...like one person was being groomed for something...and literally ended up punching a literal prince of somewhere in the face and running for their life...that story was told to me YEARS ago...another person I did try to help but was too far gone on the alcohol...told me about the grooming...in a certain organization...the rituals this person participated in. I'm saddened to think now that some part of me was having a hard time believing it. </p>
<p>Flash forward years later and this...so believe...it's real...it goes deep and there isn't anything they won't do to protect it...it's all well and good if anyone speaking out is deemed nuts...but this shit is 100% impossible to deny once it starts coming out, heads will roll...and I do trust we will do a far far better job than the Brits did...IYKWIM. At least I hope so.</p></p>

<p><p>For what?  He's not releasing the pedo porn, just a "client list".  If its a fake "client list", then he didn't hack anything - what's the crime?</p>
<p>If its real, then the threat of prosecution for reviewing a hacked doc is about the same as with WikiLeaks.</p></p>

<p><p>Right, not a criminal offense.  But if OP made up all this and the chef/owner gets wind of it, which I assume has, he could sue.  Probably wouldn't be that hard to find OP.  </p></p>

<p><p>Seriously.  Some of you are complete sociopaths.  Fake?  Explain the website being gone!  That alone should shut all you sociopaths up.  These kids aren't 'professionals' with this...they're probably scared out of their minds and have been since they glommed onto it.</p>
<p>So instead of siting on yer fat ass and calling things fake, why not just shut up and wait 24 hours?  Give some postiive feedback, instead of being complete dbags. </p>

<p><p>I am relatively new to all this, and i have been on this like 36 hours ago non-stop. My entire level of consciousness has changed reading everything on pizzagate. Can we please somehow agree in advance that in case an URL is posted here, someone trustable and with reliable reputation go check it and let us all know if legit or not. I DO NOT want to go have to click there myself.</p></p>

<p><p>Don't click on anything labeled CP, definitely not a good idea. Whether it is a honeypot or not, you don't want that shit on your computer. Consider whether your computer is taken for some other reason and then the discovery is made that at one point you had CP on it. Consider if that's years from now when pizzagate might not even be talked about anymore. It just isn't good, ever.</p></p>

<p><p>I would like to say that these claims and topics are serious big boy business.  The talks of possibilities revolving death as a result of having leaked damning info is a reality.  We see this sorta stuff on tv and movies, whose to say what we see isn't a mock up of stuff that really does go on.  Interesting times we live in guys.  I don't think I've ever been as active in Reddit as I am now.  Waiting for things to get crazier and pop off.  </p></p>

<p><p>DC does not have the same laws as rest of USA.  Look up District of Columbia Home Rule.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At certain times, and presently since 1973, Congress has allowed certain powers of government to be carried out by locally elected officials. However, Congress maintains the power to overturn local laws and exercises greater oversight of the city than exists for any U.S. state. Furthermore, the District's elected government exists at the pleasure of Congress and could theoretically be revoked at any time.</p>

<p><p>Look it's way more than you think. I literally am just now piecing together what I was not told. But suffice it to say...I literally know someone who disappeared...because this person was eaten....and when questioned..I was told...that this person is not currently eaten (but forever tainted) due to a federal judge not buying the story. That's all...people who tried to do something got "set up" in the worst possible way.</p></p>

<p><p>Look, it is true that the more people have this the better..but you all really need to get a consensus and a plan to do that in a safe organized way. Gathering everything and planning a alt media dump on one day at one time...without mercy. </p>
<p>I agree ride or die, trust me I do. I'm one of those kids. But it must be done the Anon hydra way...when one is taken down 10k rise up. </p>
<p>The US Naval War college teaches a course on ANON, stand alone complex and hive mind. They KNOW how to work it an manipulate it. There is a small teeny country with the most vicious intel group in the world and they also know how to work this....the saving grace of "anon" is that it is inherently suspicious.</p>
<p>I was told the day after the election that that teeny country was going on an all out assault along with the well known Soros...because said top level of that gov. has no way to blackmail Trump. They are literally desperate. Ok not entirely true...this is how it went down...me hey hon whats up? OP(other person): I talked to cousin yesterday (cousin is agent of said teeny country's nasty intel group based in Oz at the moment)...me: yeah what did he have to say? OP: that Trump is a liar and will never keep any of his promises. Me: so based on that you know what they're going to do next right? OP: yes, try to make everyone distrust, and if that doesn't work to stop it...Me: then something will happen that will? OP: yes. Me:fuck this shit, that asshole needs to go down too (speaking of PM/president of said teeny little corrupt country with evil intel agency)....</p>
<p>bam news today....asshole president being investigated for corruption.</p>
<p>There are white hats...but please proceed with caution. These people will not go quietly into that dark night.</p>
<p>Edit to add..I am literally a nobody..literally. However in my life I have traveled a great deal.....and met very interesting people. The sort of person that I am means that people tell me shit. </p></p>

<p><p>Wikileaks said they're larping....so....I mean...not much. I don't doubt the FBI anons first couple of posts but I can't even prove that after those posts it was the same person :/ we really need a website to work on this shit. Reddit and the Chans are perpetuating a lot of trolls. We need our own place to work on this before releasing the finds indisputably to the public</p></p>

<p><p>Because the FBIanon was correct, the real juice lay in the foundation, and anyone trying to misdirect would never have said that.</p>
<p>We need to measure truthfulness by production. And damage potential. Had the FBIanon said "OMG the you need to investigate John Smith, he's the key" and every one ran off to investigate JS and found nothing...that's purposeful useful misdirection. Keeps everyone busy doing nothing. This information actually bore great fruit and when the pieces came together...CF trafficking with the actual people, then came pizzagate. And knowing that the letter agencies are eating their own..meaning top level people who are taped/blackmailed colluding to take out any letter agent that is foolish/naive enough to investigate...I do believe FBIanon. </p>
<p>I do not believe the WikiAnon...I just do not.</p>
<p>I agree 100% that wiki has gone dark...would YOU fucking go to a window and wave? I think Julian may no longer be at the embassy..or it is possible that is what we need to think. I do believe there is an absolute frantic effort to find him and shut these people down...but it is illogical to think that this same thing could not have been done before. Not having done so lost Hill the election and revealed pizzagate.</p>
<p>To suppose that after the fact they have been successful is illogical.</p>
<p>There is no reason to believe that the people currently shitting their pants over pizzagate would have sat idley by thinking "OMG never mind those people are too stupid to figure it out"...The Naval War College teaches a course on Anonymous, Stand Alone Complex and the Hive Mind, trust me they KNOW this is successful...so why risk any of it ever being put together by not taking Julian out sooner.</p>
<p>We need to chill a bit. I believe the people running wiki have been under the gun for so long that they really have made contingency plans...they are not stupid and have had the help of HONEST people for years. I think they know how to poof themselves. I'm not so easily put into an uproar because wiki won't answer questions or makes it seem as if they are compromised. When KDcom says something...then maybe..because he's in the know as well. </p>
<p>Did you spot the email where they discuss the NZ EQ? And the cryptic "right on cue" comment? There's a reason for that. There is also (or was...that shit disappeared) some evidence to suggest that the US Naval ship off the coast of Haiti launched some sort of scalar attack right before the EQ. There was just another EQ in NZ...and to be honest I expect that if they don't get control of things soon, the US may indeed have attention diverted.</p>
<p>THere is so much shit...why do you think the UFO tards start screaming OMG UFO the ISS shut their feed down but we saw it....Both Russia and the US have crafts capable of hyperspace flight. That's why they shut the feed off...Not that there are not aliens...but that shit is ours. I've personally seen the TR3B and had a chat with a AF gen. afterwards..who laughed and said..that's like 20 years old. But if you were a test pilot of that amazing craft you'd literally have a blast fucking with people.</p>
<p>Anyway...there is collusion at the highest levels...a brotherhood of blackmail to ensure no one ever says a damn word. Why do you think Hollywood has gotten away with it for so long...and why people say it happens (as Elijah Wood just did) but NEVER name names.</p>
<p>Scroll through my posts where I address the Hollywood issue.</p></p>

<p><p>Fuggit bro, I've been going in raw.  Just dont click onto any suspicious links that could contain CP related material.  Not to say that I'm not on some list of some kind, but for those browsing with no extra layer of security, I wouldn't fret too hard.  The masses have been looking into this subject matter more and more.  It really is enticing, isn't it?   I mean sucks that this shit may ring true, but I mean to witness a scandal this fuckin huge and intricate is better than all the movies, shows, books I've ever seen or read.</p></p>

<p><p>If you downloaded any KP accidentally immediately call FBI and report where you downloaded it from, record the call. I have done this before..it covers your ass. They asked me to send them what I'd found and that was the end of it. They can't come after you if you report it right away...make a record. Trust me they won't do anything about it.</p></p>

<p><p>Fair point.  When claims like this are made you should sticky a comment though or address it immediately.  Just "in an abundance of caution this thread is locked until proof is provided.  Portion of the post have been deleted due to it containing possible  CP"....transparency is good and going forward I'm sure you guys will run into this situation again</p></p>

<p><p>Which is my concern. How can anyone even validate claims like this. Seems like huge risk and no reward. If this is legitimate then OP should just report it to as many law enforcement agencies as possible. </p></p>

<p><p>Well Ive looked trough the links provided in the "first guy's" post and I can tell that it was the mother of all NSFW. It was like 5 hours ago and Im just now getting a grip over myself.</p>
<p>You can check my post history, people looked trough it and didnt find anything suspicios. Originally Ive joined reddit like 6 months ago for a mobile phone game subreddit and just continued to use the account on this subreddit.</p>
<p>EDIT: this was probably not an answer to your question after reading it again</p></p>

<p><p>The PGP message he posted does not appear to be valid.
Here is what I get when I run pgpdump on a legit PGP message:</p>

<p><p>I am fairly amateur, if someone believes they are better suited to compromise the location, I can get a device equipped with the right tools on wifi and provide remote access to it. RDP through SSH or something similar. There would be latency, but you'd have real time access to their network as if you were there in person.</p></p>

<p><p>The problem with any sort of "group action" on a subject such as this is that even having the best of intentions, any actual "evidence" (read: illegal indecent images of children) is in itself a crime. Disseminating said information is an even greater crime.
Anyone presenting such a swathe of data to law enforcement is complicit, more importantly (for us) they make themselves a worthy scapegoat.</p>
<p>Report whatever you have directly to law enforcement. Report it to local law enforcement. If what you have is suitably damning send it out to media outlets. Disseminating any images is not only illegal, it's immoral. Let the media deal with breaking the story, and law enforcement deal with handling the crime. </p></p>

<p><em>The level of incompetence in this "hack" is extremely concerning.  I am not sure what OP was trying to accomplish, but without the private key this is useless</em></p>
<p>Please provide all of the data/files/html as evidence to MULTIPLE PDs  (local or otherwise including the NYPD) before posting on the internet.  You need to protect yourself, and establish a chain of evidence.  Contacting an attorney is also very critical.  If you do not have an attorney, get one asap.</p>
<p>If you do provide "evidence" on the web do it in an encrypted dump in bittorrent, all users should be careful and protect themselves, this could be a honeypot</p>
<p>No one cry wolf without validating OP's "evidence".  Bringing false leads to the authorities is a surefire way to lose all credibility for this sub.</p>
<p><em>edit: Other users have pointed out, with good reason that local PD alone may be complicit and may not be the course of action.  Simply linking on the internet is not how you bust these people though.  You need to get as many eyes on the evidence as possible and make sure they understand you want to establish a chain of evidence and that your life is in danger.</em></p>
<p><em>edit2: added request for encrypted bittorrent dump, and piece about false reporting to authorities</em></p>
<p><em>edit3: contact attorney</em></p></p>

<p><p>http://boards.cindysbeentrippin.com/t/wait-what-mr-potato-head-aka-trey-gowdy-uses-his-own-private-email-server/11154 I'm sure he knows all about the ring already. I'm guessing the OP on that link has some insider knowledge by calling Gowdy Mr. Potato Head, Mr. Potato Head is slang amongst these people for having no genitals (presumably chopped/shot off by these freaks). Was surprised to see the person who wrote the letter OP posted is David Brock, which brings us right back to Comet Ping Pong. </p></p>

<p><p>What's up with that site you linked? That thread went into some seriously bitter interpersonal feud shit between a few of the posters there super quick. Also, while I'm sadly all too familiar with the various code words and linguistic parlance of these disgusting pedophiles I wouldn't take the "Mr Potato Head" remark to be an implication that Gowdy is some kind of eunuch. I just can't take that seriously for a second. The whole letter supposedly attributed to that SCUMBAG Brock likely was written in an attempt to try and deflect attention away from the Hillary email scandal, the dates certainly correspond plus it fits in with the usual playbook of those pieces of shit at CTR..namely full of false accusations made with no proof to back them up. </p></p>

<p><p>I honestly have no idea wtf that thread or that website was, just the first thing on google when looking that up, really hoping that Gowdy and Chaffetz are all right. David Brock could be the "comeatmebro" OP for all I know, I don't think these people are particularly smart.  Interesting enough I'm watching Rick and Morty right now and just as I'm typing this, Summer's dog gained intelligence and was saying "where are my testacles". Anyways I'm pizzagated out, this is all so much. </p></p>

<p><p>No. Stop giving advice when you are not an expert.  Sheesh.</p>
<p>Contact an attorney!  Call someone, anyone you know who might know one.  Then call them.  That's the way to proceed. NEver just show up on a police door with illegal material.  That's retarded and anyone who suggests it is damaged goods.</p></p>

<p><p>I think he meant he posed as a "customer" and was given a valid reference by his 3 letter agency friend, and then was given the data willingly. He mentions physically going to the pizza place and leaving with the data. Not saying that means it's true, but I don't think he's claiming to have accessed on an unencrypted server.</p></p>

<p><p>Send to the police AND to every mainstream media outlet in the country AND to every alternative media outlet in the country (infowars etc) AND across every social media channel you can find. </p>

<p><p>He could have posed as a service technician (e.g. Comcast) and been given access to their equipment where he could have easily grabbed the files -- which may/may not have been connected to the Internet at all.  This seems more likely -- most of the most notorious hacks have almost always involved some semblance of social eng.</p></p>

<p><p>Lets for your argument sake say he knows where the server is kept, which isn't at home (because no way someone with that much to hide would have a service tech mess with their servers). Wouldn't the data be hidden from the IT? I would think the host of the servers would make it impossible for the IT to view any of his clients information.</p></p>

<p><p>I see a ton of people just shooting it all down, and I get that.  I'm not trying to really defend it as legit, but having now looked into WTP a bit more, there are some suspicious and dubious connections.  That being said, it was my understanding that he said they were tipped off by 3-letter alphabet friend, so would seem likely that they: knew what was there and how to get it w/o being caught.  Also, never underestimate the stupidity of humans.  Lots of people get caught doing really dumb stuff (e.g. Podesta's email password).</p>
<p>I don't know anything about OP(s) and won't comment on the absurdity of the claims or not, but I do think WTP should be looked into -- there's enough there to make it interesting.</p></p>

<p><p>It's all speculation up this point.  Nothing concrete.  Would've been insane to have that post about the NYPD leaking the CP found in Anthony Weiner's laptop be true!  Keep an open mind to all possibilities.  It's what got many of us here to begin with.</p></p>

<p><p>Most real hacks are all about exploiting the human element. A lot of the low-hanging fruit vulnerabilities in tech are easily patched now, and non-trivial brute-force approaches are only an absolute last resort. The only BS here is people that don't know what they're talking about.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah it just drops down additional text that says "watch this space..." I'm thinking it is just a spot for a headline notification/ important news drop down. Most likely comes default with the coming soon template being used. Probably what they originally used before ever making the site public way back. I accidentally clicked it and freaked but nothing significant.</p></p>

<p><p>Noticed that, thought maybe it was literal. "Watch this space" as in, keep watching and something will appear. Or maybe if there is some program you can run in that space to trigger something?
Agh, I don't know. I don't all that much about programming/websites.</p></p>

<p><p>Hey been following your work. I completely believe this is real and the connected levels are government, entertainment elites. That being said...and I cannot nor will I say more than this...I know 100% that this involves elements in the highest levels of government. Yes, there are FBI pedos, CIA pedos, NSA pedos...and presidential pedos. They get by by getting a "fellow" on tape which is eternal blackmail.</p>
<p>My knowledge comes from one of the above agencies that is literally full of pedos on tape. This agency will not hesitate to eat their own, imprison their own, and set UP their own to stop any investigation that may..uncover. That means that yes an agency literally runs KP sites for the express purpose of spreading KP under the guise of stopping it. If any person in such an agency were of a mind to stop it...they will find themselves charged with KP. This goes from cops to judges and lawyers...once on tap they are eternally bound to this sick brotherhood and will do what is needed to protect it. I cannot say more here because not even Reddit is safe. You all are doing the right thing and making your efforts 100% public will go a long way to protect you, but good luck finding non involved LE to do anything about it. I may or may not have some personal knowledge (and watching this I may or may not have figured out more) of a person who may or may not have ended up on the wrong end of the pedos in gov. offices.</p>
<p>Don't stop, keep it public. This is real, true, and what you're doing can make a difference. But they will not go down easy. If it is possible to hang in there until Trump takes office and JA comes out of hiding...gather the evidence stash it around the world, and just bide your time.</p>
<p>They will literally do anything to stop this. Many a fine person has been ruined trying to do what you are doing.</p>
<p>I literally had no idea the scope of this...until I started reading pizzagate as what I may or may not have been told was told in a limited way, probably to protect me..meaning "what you don't know can't hurt you" sort of thing...I'm just now figuring it out. </p>
<p>For the kids, and for all of those who tried...and failed. Be careful, but determined. I have zero knowledge of OP,  or anything in particular related to Pizzagate. All I can absolutely say is these agencies will literally eat their own, have eaten their own...to protect this. There's nothing more I can add so don't ask. No way in fucking hell would I ever give up anyone who may or may not have been eaten and lived to tell about it.</p>
<p>and please...only those people with absolute expert knowledge on how to protect themselves should be doing this. </p></p>

<p><p>This is actually going to be a lot easier than you think.</p>
<p>First, you have to realize that it is illegal to possess what you have unless you are just giving it to the cops.</p>
<p>What I would do is this. First, get all of your data together. Second, pick an FBI office from here: https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us</p>
<p>Third, show up there ASAP, walk into the door, and ask to see an agent. Just turn over everything you have and be completely honest. </p>
<p>Problem solved. You'll live and be fine. Justice will come down on the perpetrators of the crimes that you saw.</p>
<p>I don't think you need to talk to a lawyer first. Technically, you can, but since you haven't done anything wrong, you don't need to.</p></p>
