<strong>Beware of misinformation trying to discredit pizzagate!</strong>
<p><p>I was looking up Podesta emails then I came across this on Realtruenews.org: http://www.realtruenews.org/single-post/2016/11/04/Podesta-Emails-SECRET-CODE</p>
<p>The first 2 emails are legit finds, but the last one is made up. They didn't even clarify it as a joke or anything. They're putting out wrong information, trying to discredit pizzagate for people who are too lazy to find out on their own! Watch out folks! </p></p>

<p><p>Scaremongering in the media and trying to make something more 'entertaining' than it already is will unfortunately always be there.</p>
<p>Not sure why with this though, it's creepy enough as it is.</p></p>

<p><p>I mean, it's already difficult to filter through all the crap on MSM. Some are real, some are overly biased and worded smartly to make it sound just the opposite. </p>
<p>But with fake information embedded in these alternative media sites like RealTrueNews.org, which actually has "Fact Checker" and all, it's just messed up. </p>
<p>No wonder it's so hard for people to WAKE UP! </p></p>
