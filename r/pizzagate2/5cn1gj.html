<p><p>Putin and his cronies get billions of dollars hard cash frozen. Putin retaliates by preventing Americans adopting Russian children.</p>
<p>Strange?</p>
<p>Do you think Putin is trying to give out a signal here?</p></p>

<p><p>It's definitely a lead I'd say. Maybe we should look more into Putin? If there is any type of secret international ring then I'd bet money that Putin at least knows about it.</p></p>

<p><p>guys, i doubt this sickness shit will never go down in Russia. It is simply not how our "power hungry" minds would work. no offence, but a lot of reasons for this in the west is due to decades of decadent media normalising this shit (whilst in M.E their religion probably OKs them to do this). russia is hard core orthodox christian. </p>
<p>this is not to say that we dont have criminals doing this and like chechen mafia etc kidnapping kids etc, but what im trying to say i doubt theres a massive top putin level support for child crime. </p>
<p>Putin also said recently before election "a country that cant protect its kids, has no future" - or something along those lines. If anything, he knows how fucking sick Clintn was and thats why he hoped for a Trump presidency. </p>
<p>Maybe Russia will give all the info to Trump and they will all go to jail. </p></p>

<p><p>There was 5 different entities that hacked Clinton's server.  It's strongly believed Russia is one of them. This would be a reasonable response to what was uncovered, and just further corroborates that.  Especially in light of Russia's very vocal welcoming of Trump.  </p></p>

<p><p>Let's not start a fucking war here! I just think that Putin's recation seemed a little odd at the time, but there is clearly $$$$$ at stake here. Usually with investigations like this, the first thing one does is follow the money....</p>
<p>We need to start getting accounting records for these places. I don't know enough about american company reporting - it's public, no? Shareholders of companies should be readily available as public records. I've seen no one digging this stuff. Is there a place to start? Is this at a state or federal level?</p></p>

<p><p>I wouldn't put it past the minds of those in high positions to start a cyber war of sorts. I was probably sensationalizing a little there and that I will retract.</p>
<p>A possible Reddit attack thereby cleaning everything out and blaming it on the other side is possible - either a genuine attack or a false-flag. Discrediting any findings along the way. We're already hearing of DDoS attacks.</p></p>
