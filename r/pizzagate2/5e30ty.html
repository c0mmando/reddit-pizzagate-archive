<strong>Being suicided or getting clipped</strong>
<p><p>I would like to believe that this isn't a real concern. But could this be a possibility for any of us? I'll put it this way I'm not very good with the technical side of cyber security. I'm more of a boots on the ground kinda guy. An been researching this for a while now. Should I or we be concerned ? I thought it was funny that a DNC field director followed me on Twitter a long time ago when I started tweeting about Mena airport. Maybe I shouldn't be laughing.</p></p>

<p><p>They "suicide" people like investigators... people with real evidence that can damage them... people who enter the king cobra's cave... I don't think they'll be killing random civilians just cuz they're posting images that are out there in the open already (alefantis' instagram pics... etc etc) </p></p>

<p><p>This. The most worried out of all of us would be diggers and investigators. Next would be publishers. But at a certain size it does not matter anymore. We have reached that size and more.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm not fuckin scared... I submit to https://tips.fbi.gov/ with my real name and address... I don't use a throwaway... these little creeps only get away with this shit cause of their FBI/PD enforcers... who aren't part of the equation anymore. Anyone involved in this is going to spend their time covering their tracks and leaving the country... not trying to hunt down some random anonymous nerd in a cloud of millions of them. As long as you don't go physically snooping around locations near you... you will be fine. </p>
<p>We've flipped on the lights and the cockroaches are running... fear nothing... fear of reprisal is the tool they have used to get away with this for so long... but they are neutered now. </p>
<p>I have faith that the 95% of the FBI/CIA/DOJ that got into the job because they love justice are ready to fix everything and shine up their tarnished image. James Comey is finishing the work of Ted Gunderson. </p></p>

<p><p>Damn I need to read up more on cyber security. Only thing I'm good at would be static surveillance. Not afraid either my friend. Would like nothing more then to take these people down. </p></p>

<p><p>I've been stalked by them but they haven't killed me yet and I doubt theyll kill anyone as long as you keep the information digging small time. They wacky people like assange and wikileaks, not redditors.  </p></p>
