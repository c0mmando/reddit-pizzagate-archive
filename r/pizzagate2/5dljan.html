<strong>I need little help for writing an article about pizzagate in my country.</strong>
<p><p>Hi reddit. I am from Poland and here on mainstream and even non-mainstream media there is no such info about #pizzagate. Not even an article. But we have big community wykop.pl (sth like digg/reddit) where I could force this sick trend. But, as you know, there is way too much info about pizzagate and podesta-related story. And whole info is decentralized, here, on chans etc. Sad thing is that there was interesting summary on The_Donald but somehow it doesn't exist now. Deleted. So I need a simple chronological summary to pizzagate. I don't need those pictures from chans but reliable confirmed info about what we know by now. Any ideas? And I need all pictures dump from comet insta. Can u help me?</p></p>

<p><p>I want to reiterate the first point. The occult and rituals may be a huge component in all of this, but including it in a synopsis for first time viewers will result in them dismissing it. Guaranteed. </p></p>

<p><p>Not necessarily. Maybe people in Poland would want to know how really weird the Americans are. I think that woman and her creepy art were very compelling evidence that the bunch of them are satanists. I thought it was very convincing. </p></p>

<p><p>That is a definite exception because it is well-documented. You're right. But I still wouldn't lead with it. More of a conclusion. </p></p>

<p><p>I disagree with the people who don't want to mention the occult angle, and I find it odd that so many people are pushing this idea.</p>
<p>The argument is basically that it is too far-fetched and will turn off people from taking everything else seriously. But that's BS. This whole thing is far-fetched and difficult to digest at first, but it's gaining traction because of the evidence, and the occult connections are definitely part of that evidence. It can't simply be swept under the rug. If anything, the occult provides a strong explanation for what motivates these people and how the abuse became institutionalized and so widespread. <strong>Please don't ignore this critical piece of the puzzle</strong></p></p>

<p>Yea but the occult is not illegal, end of story, people can read about that all they want, but what matters is what they are motivated to do.</p></p>

<p><p>I never claimed it was illegal. No investigation relies simply on illegal actions. Instead, it builds upon all relevant information in order to build a case, and I'm claiming that the occult is part of that relevant information. The investigation is incomplete if we ignore key details that could help tie the loose ends together</p></p>

<p><p>I honestly dont give a fuck about the occult, if you see so many people saying its a bad idea, maybe they are right. Its there, if people want to follow that route they can certainly find out about it. But you should not lead with its, its stupid as hell. You start with the crime and criminal connections.</p></p>

<p><p>Hello, friend from Poland</p>
<p>Here is where pizzagate ties into Poland...</p>
<p>Max Spiers was investigating the same cult that pizzagate is looking for and died in the process.</p>
<p>https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1998060/max-spiers-conspiracy-theories/</p>
<p>http://www.maxspiers.com/</p>
<p>April 2000 Warsaw, Poland; Tomasz Suszyna and Robert Krakowian pleaded guilty to murder</p>
<p>A 19-year-old woman and a 17-year-old boy were killed during a ritual Satanic mass in southern Poland, police said after finding the cut up and burned bodies. The two victims were members of a sect that staged the black mass in a disused bunker on the outskirts of the town of Ruda Slaska, but they did not know they were to die. Another teenage cult member who survived was taken to the hospital with multiple knife wounds. See, "Teenage cult members killed in Satanic mass," Agence France Presse, March 4, 1999 and "Polish satanists jailed for ritual double murder", Agence France Presse, April 1, 2000.</p>
<p>The story is the satanic ritual abuse occurring across the world, where investigations are being tanked, intentionally, to protect the higher ups.</p></p>
