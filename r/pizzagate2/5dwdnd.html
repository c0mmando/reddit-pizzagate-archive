<p><p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_satanic_ritual_abuse_allegations
http://www.inquisitr.com/3115673/elijah-wood-says-child-abuse-is-widespread-and-organized-in-hollywood/</p>
<p>I just want to start off by saying I always considered Alex Jones to be fucking insane and never really gave any of his opinions a second thought. It sounds absolutely fucking insane to say the US government is filled with pedophiles and ontop of that occult rituals.</p>
<p>But the fat fuck even <a href="https://youtu.be/FpKdSvwYsrE?t=1h51s">snuck into the Bohemian Grove</a>, filmed the freaky shit that was going on, proving this weird ritual stuff does take place and the elite are absolutely obsessed with it. But people still refuse to believe it.</p>
<p>So what I'm saying to the non believers and people who are still in denial... what is  the hard smoking gun evidence we need? 
Its doubtful any will be on the surface web, things are done on the dark web for a reason...we still have non believers saying we are just putting coincidences with edgy artists and innocent old people talking about food. How can you prove something so fucked up and undergound/hidden without photos of them in the act or people going out and doing some actual real life investigating?  </p>
<p>Individually we can't do much but search for more connections that sceptics probably won't bother looking at because of the level of tinfoil hat associated with this. Its also super dangerous trying to gather evidence IRL (been a few suicides recently from people looking into this stuff) But together nothing can stop us. Good will always outweigh Evil. Imagine if the whole world was reporting on it.... something would have to be done.</p>
<p>We need a sticky or something dedicated to spreading this like wildfire. Our power is in our numbers &amp; voices. I just pray to god Trump really does drain the swamp and doesn't get JFK'd beforehand.</p></p>

<p><p>Smoking gun evidence would be video/photographs that implicate people.  Also things like monetary transactions are helpful, but nowhere near as damning as a photo - thats the true nail in the coffin.  You only need to catch one person; one person who may have dirt on others and could flip (assuming our cunty justice system will prosecute/act)</p></p>

<p><p>So dig through all the cp dark web pages (if someone can find a .tor address that links to one of them and hasn't been cleared already)  and even if found how is anyone gonna share illegal photos like that? Its a crime to have CP and to send it to people</p></p>

<p><p>Technically, i think it is legal if it is for research/exposing crime.  But the people you are trying to catch are the ones who would be prosecuting you, so you wouldnt stand a chance.</p>
<p>Didnt somebody famous claim they were researching child pornography?  Pete Townsend maybe?  And nobody bought his excuse.  But maybe, maybe he really was digging to find something</p></p>

<p><p>I saw a link a few weeks ago that was being advertised as Bill Clinton raping an underaged girl. I can not verify if that is what it was or not because I never watched it. Watching it would be watching child porn if it is what they said it was. </p>
<p>"Smoking gun evidence" is illegal for us to pass around. Isn't that a clever cover up technique in order to make sure the public never gets wise to what they are doing? It is waterproof. </p></p>

<p>Trump is picking anti-globalists that are worse than him for his cabinet so hopefully they don't fuck with him </p></p>

<p><p>Yes let's trust the billionaire friend of the Clinton's that's made creepy as fuck comments about his daughter. He's totally different. </p>
<p>Wake the fuck up. This sub may actually be important, quit the fucking rhetoric and work the case. </p></p>

<p><p>ppl are always gonna be out diggin but this shit needs to blow up big time before they fuckin cover up everything.. Its still not mainstream enough none of my m8s have heard anything about it. They are also trying to bury it by bringing up old articles and tagging it with things like pizzagate. Its fucked</p></p>

<p><p>He seems to be into girls that are 16, not 1 - 10, there is a really big difference in how abusive that is. </p></p>

<p><p>It's as simple as looking at the history of pedophilia. Anyone saying pizzagate isnt true can't read.  It's that simple.  There are articles detailing these rings going back to the 60s. All the leaks did was make us say "hmm we should probably wake up and look into this". Don't let a shill tell you this isn't real.  History had proven this is very real</p></p>
