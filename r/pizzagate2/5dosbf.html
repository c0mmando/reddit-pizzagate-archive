<strong>Too Risky To Post Fliers Around My Town?</strong>
<p><p>I'm protected and everything, just curious if you all think that's a stupid idea. What would be the necessary steps in order to keep myself safe when printing these so they aren't traceable? I know that putting fliers out and raising awareness will help. Simply putting "Google #Pizzagate, Save The Children" or something like that.</p></p>

<p><p>Something simple with just #pizzagate should be enough to do the trick. Maybe put a QR code linking to a Google search.</p>
<p>I think the most important thing is to get enough people thinking about this, even if they don't do anything to make progress.</p>
<p>Plenty people I know dismiss this as just another conspiracy theory that will die down soon enough. If it stays consistent, it will reach a broad enough audience to make a real impact.</p></p>

<p><p>If you can, buy an old shitty printer off craigslist with cash, the older the better, as long as it works. New printers have watermarks on them, often times companies record who has what printer, for investigations, etc.</p>
<p>When you do go out, make sure you cover your face as much as you legally can if you think agents are onto you. Hopefully your online opsec is good too.</p></p>
