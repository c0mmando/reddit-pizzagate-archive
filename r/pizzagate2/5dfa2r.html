<p><p>In the fall 2008 Eric McFadden was using code language to arrange sex for customers with at least one underage girl in the Brewery district of Columbus Ohio. </p>
<p>He was convicted in Jan 2009.  Juliana Gendelman notified John Podesta. </p>
<p>He had been connected with Podestas group - Center for American Progress.  He was "Hillary's liaison" who represented Catholic concerns.  (Ironic)</p>
<p>So here is a known case where a real person with ties to Hillary Clinton and John Podesta was operating out of a normal looking business using code language to traffic underage prostitutes. </p>
<p>So why is it such a stretch to believe that something similar was / is taking place at Comet Pizza given all the other dark, twisted and long string of "coincidences"?  </p>
<p>And what happened to this group of individuals who understood the code language and paid for these services?  Who are they?  Code language only works if more than one person understands it. </p>

<p>"McFadden used complex encoded postings on Craigslist that would look like useless or corrupted data, in which he would embed the information of the woman available, the type of sex interaction she would be willing to perform and the place to meet her."</p></p>

<p><p>Bruh, you seen the new episode of South Park where Garrison is elected? The episode contained so much based shit. </p>
<p>there was part where the entire internet history of a whole town was released, and it turned into complete chaos and bedlam as everyone started killing everyone else over what they found, and then the whole town was walled off from the world "because there is no telling who's internet history those people saw" </p>
<p>They had Bill Clinton and Bill Cosby doing a dance talmbout "we are gonna teach you boys how to be gentlemen so we are starting Bill Clinton' Gentleman's Club" all but saying is he a rapist, then they had him smiling when he saw Butters put his dick against the glass door, and later in the episode he went to Butters house and asked to see Butters, his dad protested but then his mom said cmon he is the gentleman, let him in</p>
<p>He is taken upstairs, butters has his dick out, and they let him in butters room, and closes the door to leave them in private. </p>
<p>It was all in the context of other jokes but I am sure that Matt and Trey know what's up. </p></p>

<p><p>Is anybody here checking craigslist listings in the DC area? Craigslist is an easy way to, um, advertise goods. Wouldn't be surprised if it was a common way for these kinds of people to communicate.</p></p>

<p><p>That's a really good question.  I've been thinking about that a lot.  And you know what?  the thing that makes the most sense is exactly what the critics of pizzagate find most ridiculous: using common words with hidden meanings.  Easy to remember.  Easy to explain away. </p>
<p>Thus, pizza, pasta, sauce, coffee, big, small, etc...</p>
<p>It would be wonderful if someone had a contact in the Columbus police dept who could possibly access that file and see exactly what the "coded language" was.   </p></p>

<p><p>Let me re-state:</p>
<p>Say I'm a "john" looking for a good time on Craigslist, and I stumble upon an ad somewhere. I am not aware of its meaning or codes, so I gloss over it.</p>
<p>How do I know what I am buying? Obviously having some middle-aged horndog create an algorithm to search for sexy codes seems like a stretch.</p></p>

<p><p>An old friend worked on this type of project and he said there are codes they use- much like the stuff coming out about the food references....I guess they tell each other on the dark web, I am not more sure as that is above my pay grade</p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reflecting on this guy's background, interviews, and experience, it was clear that he was a very militaristic liberal who seemed to be using his faith as a springboard to political success. It's sad to think that anybody can call themself a Catholic, a Luthern, a Muslim, a Jew and leverage that associate for their own good. The result is that it underminds the true faith of the religion they claim to be a part of and gives another excuse for those who do not believe to say, "see, that's why I'm not religious."</p>

<p><p>Great find.  Thanks!</p>
<p>Here's the most interesting part: 
"Through the course of 2 hours, we unraveled what was a tangled web of online coded prostitution. We uncovered what looked like jibberish. A combination of some computer language, an asian language, english, and a system of numbers.
After analyzing this for about 10 minutes, it was clear to me that a code was embeded, it wasn't just jibberish or computer code. There were real names, addresses, and descriptions about what type of sexual favors these women would perform. He used this code to solicit sex on Craigslist."</p>
<p>So it looks like his code was different from the food-based code words that have been the main part of pizzagate.   Hmmm...</p></p>
