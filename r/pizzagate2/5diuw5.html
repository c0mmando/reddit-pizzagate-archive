<strong>How Was This Missed?</strong>
<p><p>I think this article may have been overlooked.  It's awfully damning through the lens of Pizzagate.  Also notice the report mentioned now links to a 404.</p>
<p>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/10/27/madeleine-mccann-kate-gerry-mi5_n_4167645.html</p>
<p>Archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20161117222632/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/10/27/madeleine-mccann-kate-gerry-mi5_n_4167645.html</p>
<p>"Evidence recently presented as a “breakthrough” in the hunt for Madeleine McCann was reportedly produced for her parents by a group of former spies in 2008.
Kate and Gerry McCann hand-picked a team of former MI5 agents after becoming fed up with the pace and direction of the original Portuguese investigation.
The intelligence report was kept secret for five years as it was deemed “hyper-critical” of the McCanns and their friends, reports the Sunday Times."</p>
<p>A spy looking into something like this would have likely unraveled things quickly.  Did the McCann's get mixed up in CP?  Did they owe a debt?  Were they targeted? I've not had any luck finding the intel report or any more detail than what the UK news services picked up.</p>
<p>Oh, and as an added bonus, I've yet to see this Wikileak anywhere - a direct link (maybe) to HRC:</p>

<p>Why always so specific?  Why don't they just say lunch?</p></p>
