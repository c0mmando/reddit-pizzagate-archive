<p><p>Well if it was me being accused of this, I'd just spread some CP on said boards and tip off the FBI. That way I can get rid of a big chunk of these "investigators".</p>
<p>So please, don't do it. Don't fall for it. Keep digging tough, but try not to cross any legal boundaries.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm getting so confused about what the legal boundaries are because of all the warnings posted here. Looking through WikiLeaks isn't illegal, right? Google business names and looking through publicly available databases isn't illegal right?</p></p>

<p><p>Of course that isn't illegal. Watching/saving child pornography material on your PC may get you in trouble  tough. If they somehow raid you, and accuse you of posession of CP, how can you deny you're not a pedophile using #pizzagate as a cover?</p>
<p>There was a post about a lawyer / law student a few days ago. She recommended making a diary of everything you do and find regarding this matter. So you can prove, that you were indeed searching for possible pedophiles. There were some really helpful tips in there, I'll try to find it for you.</p></p>

<p><p>Thank you. I know looking at CP is illegal, but if someone tricks you is it really illegal? Like if I tell you to google some innocent looking words and CP pops up, can you really get in trouble for that? Can I if I didn't google it? Can you get in trouble is someone tweets CP at you? The rules get blurry for me.</p></p>

<p><p>Practically no. Theoretically yes. Just downloading the image is illegal by law in pretty much all countries but you won't really get charged unless you actively look for child porn sites. Law enforcement tries to take down CP networks by infiltrating them, they don't really care much about some random guy who accidentally saw some CP.</p></p>

<p><p>I stopped going to chans years ago because rumors were people were getting changed for CP even though just thumbnails were on the computer.</p>
<p>Some people are posting that some of these pics are hard core can't unsee pics.  Trust them, you gain nothing by seeing.  If you did see, protect yourself by wiping the drive with a bleachbit like app, reinstall OS.  Don't let this ruin your life.</p></p>

<p><p>There was CP in 4chan at least dated back to 2006.. I can horridly attest to seeing sometimes 10s of said links. </p>
<p>I'm not talking about weird obscure subs, but random, probably it's most popular.</p>
<p>Most browsers cache, ergo a very dangerous place to visit even innocently. This holds true today.</p></p>

<p><p>We joked about CNN saying it was illegal to open the leaked emails but for real it is illegal to even have caches versions of cp on your computer.</p>
<p>Don't fuck around with this shit. </p></p>

<p><p>Yeah, unless you know what you are doing, and I am not even gonna advocate anyone do this but...
Burner phones/laptops, 4g prepaid hotspots/public wifi. Use a VPN like Tor, use Linux Kali, boot off a flash drive or sd card, delete everything when you are done, by nuking it with a strong earth magnet.</p></p>

<p><p>Don't rely on Tor for your VPN it is 100% not safe. Use Ivpn, airvpn, or another well known paid vpn service AND tor. Also, throwing an HDD in the microwave will suffice, if it an SSD fucking break it, burn it, then throw it in a river. But for real don't look at this stuff. You will go to prison if caught and beyond that its not good for your emotional and mental health. Leave it to the 'pros' to dig into the actual CP content. </p></p>
