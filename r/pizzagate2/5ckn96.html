<strong>[meta] /r/pizzagate is picking up a bit...</strong>
<p><p>This subreddit is getting increasingly popular. I've seen a lot of commenters from /r/all who ask to be caught up since they're out of the loop, but at the same time I've seen a few commenters who are attacking people,getting aggressive, mocking the whole sub etc.<br/>
I'd like to just provide a friendly reminder that as this subreddit gains ground and more subscribers please refrain from attacking people. Whether they're mocking or attacking the sub first, or just being critical as they're new, or even a regular poster. Keep it civil, please. Provide material for someone to look at if they are asking for proof or don't believe any of this.<br/>
Thanks, guys. Keep up the hard work. I know this is some dark, disgusting and scary shit, and it's real. So take a break if you start getting stressed, but seriously thank you to everyone who's doing whatever they can, whether you're actively digging into new material through wikileaks or other routes like that, or if you're just sharing the material on social media and in person to your friends/family; keep it up! Stay safe, guys.</p></p>

<p><p>It has gone from 3000 subscribers to over 4500 in about 24 hours.  I can barely sleep.  This is going to be the biggest turning point in all of history.  Shills are coming in HARD AND FAST.  They are trying to distort conversations, give us bad ideas, and are telling us not to investigate further.  The shills are coming in hard because we have momentum, evidence, and a cause worth risking our lives for.  They have everything to lose once the public finds out.  Keep up the good work everyone.</p></p>

<p><p>The Besta logo change was the nod for me that we're on to something.</p>
<p>Keep looking for info on Ibrahima Diallo. He links Besta Pizza to an orphanage and a beauty pagant! And the orphanage was given an award in 2015 by the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>You're right, but wouldn't you also put a notice on the site with some sort of explaination? And what the hell is the WHOIS doing pointing to a man that runs this Orphanage (named as the director on the site). How many Ibrahima Diallo's are there within a 5-10 mile radius of the place? And the fact the only two organisations we've seen directly responding/scrubbing happen to be the two we've connected. WHOIS reccords were being changes on saturday for some of 'Abe's' other websites.</p>
<p>Commet Ping Pong have changed nothing. Other than the personal account of the owner. The protected section is still available!</p>
<p>And why has not a SINGLE person from that area that knows these places come forward? Not ONE! Not even an innocent customer who can post a little comment to say 'hey guy's, there is nothing to see. The place is great!'</p>
<p>It's an open forum and anyone can have their say.</p></p>

<p><p>All I'm saying is if it was my business I'd change it ASAP and not say a word about it. The last thing you want to come out and explain is that your logo had any sort of pedo connection, its just not good publicity. </p></p>

<p><p>If it were me, I'd leave it. It's already been spotted. I may put a message out saying something, but I think to change it by stealth as if nothing has happened (leaving all the menus and shop front in tac) is a poor strategy.</p></p>

<p><p>You'll knowingly leave a pedo symbol up after it being pointed out to you by an angry mob of people? You'd just say "Meh, fuck it, Ill keep the pedophilia symbol on my pizza business amidst this big pedophilia and human trafficking scandel."?</p>

<p><p>Wasn't the message they put out explaining the logo change kind of fishy too? Like they stressed the point they were carry out only and had no way to interact with customers in a restaurant setting? I'll see if I can find the source. </p></p>

Given the small sample size (around 5000 subscribers atm), it's not hard to imagine that there aren't any people from DC, let alone people with first hand knowledge of the restaurant.. </p></p>

<p><p>Yep, I'm pretty sure. We have addresses also for the orphanage and Besta Pizza. At the orphanage also has connection with the Clinton Foundation. I'd say 90% certain it's the same person. FBI will be able to interview staff/customers for descriptions. We can only do so much behind a keyboard.</p></p>

<p><p>Rather than make this an investigation of a possible child abuse/sex trafficking ring (which actually sounds like something in the realms of possibility),  I think shills are really trying to push the "Satanic Panic" angle to delegitimize anything genuine there may be...

<p><p>I think it's important to remember that the anger, ridicule and disbelief is exactly what these people rely on for protection.  </p>
<p>If you're in their shoes, you're thinking "Who would <em>believe</em> this stuff, it's crazy".  </p>
<p>Remember though, the same people who may or may not be doing these things, these rituals involving effigies of humans and in some cases actual humans are the same people who have installed the belief that anyone who "worships a sky daddy" is certifiably insane or a backwoods hillbilly. </p>
<p>Maybe the ultra religious backwoods hicks have had it right all along? Maybe the infamous "bless your heart" so many southerners get flak for isnt so meaningless. </p>
<p>I don't know man.  Fuck you guys in this sub lol. I am in the middle of a crisis, questioning everything I've believed my whole life. </p></p>

<p><p>I've been up 2 nights and not slept. We are all living through a nightmare at the moment. But we must do all we can and we must act fast, as evidence is being distroyed. I'm hoping the FBI and those that can really help are watching.</p>
<p>I know for sure that THEY are watching us.</p>
<p>Be smart people. And trust NO ONE.</p></p>

<p><p>Try and get some sleep. Honestly, thank you for keeping up and working hard on this, but don't get yourself ill by losing sleep. Go have a day off to do something you like doing and relax. This is a group effort and the movement won't stop moving when you leave for a day. You'll come back refreshed and with your wits about you, and see some new stuff posted by others that you could likely add onto with what you've already been working on. </p></p>

<p><p>I'd nominate this article as a decent "recap/summary" - it doesn't hit everything, but it's a quick read and might help get people from /r/all up to speed.</p>
<p>http://theantiglobalist.com/eyes-wide-shut-suspected-pedophile-ring-exposed/</p>
<p>It was recently posted to /r/conspiracy - not sure if it'll help or not. </p></p>

<p><p>I saw this as it was posted on /r/conspiracy. You're right, it is a good recap/summary of what's been found so far and is a big help, especially for those new to the sub. I assume you already have, but post it where you can on social media and where it's relevant. I'll see what I can do in terms of getting it visible for those coming from /r/all</p></p>

<p><p>I just found this sub this morning, and am now subbed. </p>
<p>I've been noticing something that seems to be occurring with increasing frequency with people posting, and that's assuming any unusual piece of evidence is damning in some way. That's approaching the evidence with the conclusion already reached, and looking for evidence to support it. You can't do that. </p>
<p>Right now there's suspicion that there's a child trafficking ring operating in DC. Cool. However approach each piece of evidence as if you don't know for sure if the original theory is true. Kinda like the scientific method. </p>
<p>"What does the evidence tell you", vs "does the evidence fit the narrative." So when you're looking through social media accounts, and scanning through pictures, don't assume that everything unusual is incriminating. If you see something unusual, look deeper into that aspect of the evidence to see if it's <em>actually</em> unusual, or just unusual to you.</p>
<p>Overall though, I'm seeing some pretty crazy shit, and I still don't want to believe that a lot of it could be true, at least the way the evidence is currently pointing. I suggest you all cancel your gym memberships, delete your Facebooks, keep a lawyer on retainer, and write an anti-suicide note tucked away somewhere for safekeeping. Just kidding (or am I?)</p>
<p>One thing I do want to add, just from my own observation, is that I think the Satanic (or Luciferic) angle of this thing is being way overplayed. The whole spirit cooking thing set it off, and I think it's actually just one of those 'edgy' things rich people do when they have nothing better to do with their time. "Ooh, we're eating bodily fluids, so edgy." And that got blown into a full-blown Satanic cult.</p>
<p>I'm not saying it isn't possible, just probably isn't likely. So I wouldn't be looking for a common 'satanic' thread between what appear to be pockets of grooming rings, since it probably plays too little of a role in the overall narrative.</p>
<p>Good luck, and I'll be filtering through this stuff with all y'all. It's exciting, but scary as fuck at the same time.</p></p>

<p><p>I would not be worried if I were you.  Too much toothpaste is out of the tube already.  There are way too many people on social media who are doing the same as you are and they don't have the resources to go after anyone except the ones they might feel are most dangerous to them.  And that ain't us.  They'll be focusing their efforts on damage control and putting pressure on those within the legal and law enforcement communities to try and stop any investigations in a top-down approach.  You got nothing to worry about.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm honestly not sure if we should keep this sub off /r/all or not. We're flying under the radar at the moment, and the shilling is to a minimum, but we're starting to hit /r/all.</p>
<p>As soon as we become big and known, we become a target. We will be subject to CTR-style shilling - because people in power will go to jail for the rest of their lives if any of this stuff is true.</p></p>

<p><p>I saw the post of yours that was deleted. I didn't delete it, but in my personal opinion that particular post wasn't linked with this. I looked through that guy's posting history (I don't know if you did or not) but it looks like he was just posting the usual me_irl type material. His history was just standard shitposting memes which were all generally hit &amp; miss. I think you were reading into it a little too much. I personally think that if your post wasn't deleted it wouldn't have gained much ground anyway since it doesn't seem legitimate in relation to this research, although now it's already been and gone I guess there's no consolidation in me saying that other than moral counsel. (is that the right phrase? Do you get what I mean though?)<br/>
Anyway I saw a comment /u/fido5150 wrote in this thread and in he mentioned to look at the evidence we see as "what does the evidence say" vs "does the evidence fit the narrative."<br/>
I understand the stuff that's been uncovered so far can have some serious existential consequences for your mind, so try not to get too paranoid or overreact at everything you see. Remember, pizza is a very common junk food. It's so common it's no wonder the elites have been using it as code for so long, but try not to mix up what's genuine with what's just regular chat. Think critically, keep your wits about you, and if you think you've found something seek the thoughts of someone else who's aware of this first before posting it as if it's fact. I hope this helps. Stay safe.<br/>
(also I apologise for any spelling/grammar mistakes; I'm posting from my phone)</p></p>

<p><p>Thanks for this, some good logic in such a ridiculous mess, I'm normally a critical thinker but this has all been so crazy. I'm pretty convinced this stuff is everywhere though. This was the second post on me_irl before they scrubbed the entire child-trading subreddit https://i.reddituploads.com/7174197bdeee43d2a244affc06c79277?fit=max&amp;h=1536&amp;w=1536&amp;s=5e9997c080e5ae0cb92f6988f1a501c4, human trafficking is everywhere.</p></p>

<p><p>I think it's time to consider moving to a different platform. Reddit is good for <em>sharing</em> information, but not really good for <em>organizing</em> information. Also, this site is well known to be populated with pro-censorship personnel. We're small now and have already seen some small resistance, but if this blows up we'll be going up against a full <strong>funded</strong> army. </p>
<p>I'm not really sure of any "ideal" places for this transition personally. But I think it's time to start discussing communication <em>outside</em> of reddit.</p></p>

<p><p>What's something I can do to help? I'm relatively new to the subreddit and I don't want to just sit at the sidelines and speculate. I want to help.</p></p>

<p><p>MODS please remember to remove any Spirit Cooking/ Satanistic posts - they have nothing to do with Pizza Gate which is about the child pedo ring.....neither is it illegal to worship Satan.....it will lead nowhere in court</p></p>

<p><p>the Podestas have a link to both in that they know the owner of Comet and have had fundraisers there -  most of the people associated with Comet certinaly have an interest in Satan/Pagan gods - but I have not seen evidence that spirit cooking has anything to do directly with Comet or Pizzagate.  Pizzagate is about the pedo ring.</p></p>
