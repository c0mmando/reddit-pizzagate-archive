<strong>Podestas in Portugal @ Same Complex as Madeleine McCann at time of disappearance, staying with convicted Pedo Clem Freud</strong>
<p><p>This is a site I found that places both Podestas in the same complex as Madeleine at the time of the abduction, staying with Clem Freud, a convicted pedophile: http://victuruslibertas.com/2016/11/do-john-and-tony-podesta-have-a-connection-with-missing-child-madeleine-mccann/ It is anonymously sourced. There was a CFR meeting in Lisbon, Portugal May 3-5, 2007. See if anyone can find hard evidence.</p></p>

<p><p>Just be careful to not jump too quick on associations; the Murdoch as for the Rothschild are big families with DIFFERENT agendas sometimes. One side of the family can be all about social issues and the other about science.</p>
<p>What I mean is Murdoch father might do totally the opposite of what the daughter wants. </p>
<p>Regarding Murdoch the father, he seems to be pretty smart and always 10 steps ahead of everybody if you noticed. I'm sure he had a very fun time during the elections :-)</p></p>

<p><p>Freuds, Podesta, Portugual, Murdoch in leaked emails married to a Freud (or was) in 2007. They all defo know each other for sure. Just need evidence to place them or one of them in Portugual in May 2007 which will be impossible though as we know.</p></p>

<p><p>Interesting side note related to all of this: Podesta's own wiki page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Podesta) was changed to include the following, on November 6 (see footnotes on the page): "Podesta cooks as a hobby, specializing in Italian dishes such as risotto and biscotti.[44][45]"</p>
<p>That sure seems coincidental to make this change right after the pizzagate story, giving a cover story to their obsession with italian food and dishes. Archived page prior to the change: https://web.archive.org/web/20161028181522/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Podesta, when Podesta was still listed as a "Roman" Catholic.</p></p>

<p><p>Odd that Mrs. McCann said when meeting Clement Freud 'He cooked a “bloody marvellous” meal of watercress and egg salad followed by a chicken and mushroom risotto, “the best risotto we’ve ever tasted before or since'.  Seems he was a specialist too.</p></p>

<p><p>Clemet Freud first got attention as Briton's first "TV chef".  </p>
<p>EDIT: Not saying that changes how bizzare it is that it turns out the parents of a missing girl ended up being cooked dinner by a known pedophile who lived near where she disappeared from.</p></p>

<p><p>We need to keep going where the leads take us. Even if the parents are involved, of which I am neutral since I do not have enough info, it does not in any way preclude the involvement of others. Sicko pedos have many ways to source their targets, sometimes with the cooperation of the family. Just look at the sickening implication in this one email, which causes my stomach to turn: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736</p>
<p>That whole Tamera Luzzatto chain deserves some more attention: https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dfiek/master_thread_pizzagate_needs_to_delve_more/</p></p>

<p><p>That first email just reads as so strange... kinda makes you wonder if the word "pool" is a euphemism for harem or something. In which case the word "swimming" would mean...</p>
<p>Idk. The issue is that it could also just be the pool and that some oddball felt like the ages of the kids merited a mention. </p>
<p>It's bizarre though... I mean, why would you swim in 60 degree weather? I mean, sure, you could do it - but why mention that they bring sweaters and then also mention swimming? It's just peculiar. </p>
<p>I'm wracking my brain for a casual, logical, non-pervy explanation for that email and I keep striking out. </p></p>

<p><p>Agreed. Creepy as hell listing the ages and that they will be in the pool for their "entertainment." At best, this is a weirdo whose farm I would not want to visit. At some point, it ceases to be a few strange coincidences. </p></p>

<p><p>I'm from the UK and followed the story closely, there have been some good TV shows (for want of better wording) about the whole thing. And the father prevented a cadaver sniffing dog from doing its job raised my eyebrows. Why would you want to restrict the investigation? May find them shows on YouTube if you're interested.</p></p>

<p><p>You're not the first. If I recall correctly, people (private investigators and I think even some bobbies) believed the parents are in on it, far before any of this pizzagate stuff. Did a quick google, a detective who believed the parents faked the abduction 'recently' (Aprival 2016) won a court case against the parents - they sued him for libel.</p>
<p>They wouldn't be the first parents we'd suspect for willingly dragging their kids into all this - that Evlyn girl who was posted here no long ago would have been in a similar situation I guess, except if the mcCann parents were in on it, the abduction story would have been a ruse to collect money or whatever. It's a sickening thought, but the seriousness of the situations means these thoughts need to happen.</p>
<p>A bit more 'digging' - the detective (ex-cop) should be releasing a 2nd book soon <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1909497/ex-cop-who-accused-mccanns-of-faking-maddies-abduction-plans-second-book-slamming-brit-cops/">apparently</a>, should be interesting.</p></p>

<p><p>And follow leads that are based on facts. You won't see me saying otherwise and trying to tear everything down here. I don't share falsehoods, at least I try my best not to. But in this particular case I provided actual evidence that wasn't constructed that the wiki page wasn't a lie. But I will eventually read those leads and actually check them.</p></p>

<p><p>I think Podesta might actually be a professionally trained cook. I think he went to culinary school. I can't confirm at the moment, but something to look into. I think the food messages are a mixture of codewords and real cooking talk.</p></p>

<p><p>Good point. He also makes "walnut sauce" regularly. Google Podesta cooks for running team and you can watch a video of him cooking it. For such reasons, not all foodie talk is code. Still the conversation with Jim Steyer is a bit suspicious. E.g. Why does he forward it to his secretary who tells him Steyer has no idea what he is talking about. </p></p>

<p><p>HERE IS PROOF FROM THE WASHINGTON POST, THAT THE PODESTA'S OFTEN TRAVEL OVERSEAS FOR THE WEEKEND TO SATISFY THEIR "ART COLLECTING HOBBY":  </p>
<p>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43480-2004Sep22.html</p>
<p>Also note this quote:  "But the Podestas' stock of artists know well the benefits of securing such politically connected patronage. Uniquely capable of advocating for their artists using the lobbying skills of their day jobs, Tony and Heather can secure access, lend advice and connect artists to curators and coveted museum shows. It's backing more valuable, at times, than dollars."</p>

<p><p>The Freud-Podesta connection is interesting. I think we ought to conduct an investigation on not only Clement Freud, but his brothers and associates as well. Clement Freud seems like the perfect scapegoat to blame for a kidnapping crime. Knowing his grandfather's personality, I wouldn't be surprised if his brother or somebody was selling him out.</p>
<p>He flaunts his pedophilia to the public because he knows he's safe. At least this guy doesn't try to hide it, like everyone else.</p>
<hr/>
<p>On a separate note, Podesta's mother died 2 months prior to the kidnapping. Possible motive?</p></p>

<p><p>At most likely, his mother just happened to die. Sad.</p>
<p>At least likely, her death was to ensure Podesta's sudden travel with his brother would not be suspicious at all.  News articles in the Washingtonian says Tony Podesta travels to Europe for weekend trips to buy artwork, but that no one seems to specify where exactly he's going.</p></p>

<p><p>You mean a blog without any proof only claiming their FBI-informant said so?<br/>
Not even close to a strong link. I wish we had one though. Dig into Matthew Freud and the connection between Murdoch and Podesta.</p></p>

<p><p>Take away the FBI part, still a strong case.  There is a link between Freud and Podesta, we should check to see if they've visited that Villa before.  If they have it seems entirely too coincidental.</p></p>

<p><p>They control all the machinations of law and media. The truth is what they tell you it is unless a true outsider gains control of the rule of law. That's why they are trying so hard to derail PE Trump. Literal Laws have been written to facilitate their actions. Look into the Georgia State Senator investigating Child Protective Services(now Dead along with her Husband). ALL missing and exploited children services have been setup by these people. This is the FAR left and the FAR right manipulating all information so we fear each other and not pay attention to what the elites are doing. How is their going to be evidence when they are in a position to destroy all the evidence.</p></p>

<p><p>The big thing here is that, at least for me, this is the first I've heard of there being a residence of a known pedophile near where she disappeared. The next, most logical step to me would be to look for evidence of some sort of relationship between Freud and the Podesta's. Once we gather that info, we might find evidence of them being there that night.</p>
<p>Aside from that, whoever their "inside sources" might be, they need to get in contact with wikileaks.</p></p>

<p>They didn't know at the time that he was a pedophile, until June this year, when the documentary <em><a href="http://www.itv.com/news/2016-06-14/late-politician-sir-clement-freud-accused-of-child-sexual-abuse/">Exposure</a></em> came out. </p></p>

<p><p>"WE" did not know at the time that he was a pedophile. You cannot assume that the sickos engaged in this are not aware of their brethren, even if undetected by the public. These pedos are able to easily connect through their common interests and communication schemes. This is why the pizza code thing seems so important, only discovered by us due to Wikileaks exposing the strange communications. The date of discovering the pedophile is not nearly as important as the fact that they were suspected or found to be one.</p></p>

<p><p>The strongest link we have.</p>
<p>Remember the facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Podesta has traveled to Portugal before</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Podesta's emails before the Mccan kidnapping are wiped</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Podesta was apparently not able to respond to his email at the time of abduction, had an assistant do it for him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Podesta has ties to Freud</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freud <em>is</em> a known pedophile </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freud has a villa less than a mile from where Mccan was kidnapped</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Combine this with the circumstantial evidence surrounding it (the fact the Scotland Yard claimed higher-level interference, Freud's sudden death a few years ago, Portugal having undergone their own government-ran pedophile ring a few years ago) and it begins to come together.</p></p>

<p><p>There's no way for us to determine if he entered the country secretly, he has no travel logs as he's not technically a public figure.  Also his brother is absolutely just a lobbyist so no one was tracking him. Best guess, if he did get into Portugal illegally, he was on a chartered flight without his name, was there for a night and returned to show up for an alibi.</p></p>

<p><p>Two more</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Podesta Group received funds for consulting work from Tyco Electonics and Tyco Industries within that calendar year. That company has 3 facility and office locations in Portugal. Could provide a second motivation for visiting the area within that time frame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need to find a roster for the Trilateral Commission for 2007. Podesta was a member, but it's unclear for what years. The Trilateral commission organized the WTTC Summit in Portugal on May 10 to 12 2007.</p>

<p><p>Sharp thinking re: being skeptical of intentional alibi plants, even though the dates make this irrelevant! I think the lack of email activity prior to May 4 (deleted), the assistant sending email on his behalf on May 4, the uncanny resemblance to the sketches, CFR meeting that coincides in Portugal, etc. There are far too many coincidences, and I came to this AFTER I had already started to become convinced of the broader sex-cult issue from the workings exposed in the core Pizzagate thread. Godspeed to all for good work, and beware of the trolls and those trying to cover their tracks.</p></p>

<p><p>If we see an article suddenly appear with an alibi, it's definitely fake. I searched TO THE PITS for an alibi. Using "quote specific word search", searching newspaper archives of different languages, usin different search engines, etc.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO ALIBI. </p></p>

<p><p>I agree. The search to try to place them ANYWHERE on May 3, 2007 has been pretty exhaustive. Of course, a legit law enforcement investigation could easily show where they were based on credit card, phone, etc. The timing of the CFR meeting in Portugal May 3-5, 2007 fits perfectly, but I still cannot find a hard link to it. Could be easily buried from the past, but impossible to hide if the meeting happened. </p></p>

<p><p>I have an idea. Wikileaks actually provides quite a bit of frequent flier info for the podestas....that's a start. Need to look in those, they wouldn't necessarily have city names but would maybe have airport codes etc...</p></p>

<p><p>I read that it was in Lisbon May 3-5, 2007 and scoured the CFS website (http://www.cfr.org), including archived versions and regional looks, and I just could not find it. This should be easy for someone who really knows how to dig for events...for the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). Please help as I would guess that would be the reason to pop over to Portugal.</p></p>

<p>You can look up CFR meetings <a href="http://www.cfr.org/about/meetings/index.html?groupby=0&amp;filter=2007+5">here</a> by date or location. The only location outside the US that they list is London. You have to be a US citizen to be a CFR member, although many events are open to non-members, so I doubt that they would have a multi-day meeting in Portugal.</p></p>

<p><p>In my flurry of digging, I read it somewhere but cannot find it. I do not think it was hyperlinked, just mentioned in prose. Some others have found other good motivators...just to visit their friend Freud's place (maybe opportunity-driven), Tyco client meeting, Trilateral Commission, Portugal as a hub for art (a clear high interest for them)...</p></p>

<p><p>Problem is the crime occurred in Portugal. And the Portuguese have said they know who did it but can't charge them. FBI can't intervene unless someone else gets involved, i.e. Interpol.
Maybe the Ports are waiting until Obama is out to act. </p>
<p>Has anyone directly called the FBI about this yet? </p></p>

<p><p>Diplomatic immunity is leveraged and done in secret usually. Our State Dept did so often and it's the ugly and dirty side of it. People get away with murder, literally or risk harming 'bilateral relations' - There's some of these memos in the HRC DC Leaks and FOIA docs</p></p>

<p><p>Beware of those who clearly seem to be trolling. I think pizzalolpizza is one. The name is a giveaway, mocking the ideas we are developing. Those who have clearly set up accounts after the initial discoveries, who are constantly downgrading or pointing fingers toward rabbit holes and looney conspiracies, need to be reported and booted. If uncertain, click on the names of someone who seems to be trolling against the building case to see the pattern.</p></p>

<p><p>The coincidences are just too striking for me, and it is extremely disturbing there is near complete MSM/police authorities silence regarding the McCann case and the possible connection to the Podestas. The e-mail cut-off, the uncanny sketch similarities, the associations with pedophiles (Hastert) alone should ring bells, but they don't. It's an outrage, actually. Citizens should not have to do detective work at this level, but seem to be forced to due to overwhelming circumstantial evidence of corruption and protection at the highest levels of government, aided and abetted by a sycophantic and compliant, corrupt MSM.</p>
<p>Well, this thread seems dedicated to trying to place the Podestas in Portugal on May 3, 2007.I'll try to help out.</p>
<p>Some suggested frequent flyer connections. John Podesta's recent 2015/2016 Wikileaks released emails showed he used United, with frequent flyer number: UA-XXXXX888. Unless someone illegally has a contact with an airline (and I'm definitely NOT suggesting this) this is a no-go. Plus, there's no assurance he used United in 2007, nor do records probably go that far back.</p>
<p>However, I wonder if it's possible to LEGALLY retain a lawyer and sue for access to entry/exit records for either Portugal and/or the Schengen Area. Other possibilities may be to have a local law enforcement officer, acting upon good cause and with proper authority, request that information.</p>
<p>You'd need Podesta's passport number: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/53350</p>
<p>You'd need information regarding the database record keeping systems and policies around that time: https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09LISBON71_a.html</p>
<p>And possibly information regarding the national Portugues entry/exit information database and the Schengen Area entry/exit database: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Information_System</p>
<p>The information that I quickly reviewed suggest that it may be difficult to show specific entry/exit into Portugal (could be any Schengen-area country), however, as the Podestas are non-Schengen area citizens, those records are likely there, if they are there. </p></p>

<p><p>Years ago I discovered Alex Jones.  The tell, the perceptive tell, that convinced me to basically believe in conspiracies was that while some of the theories are outlandish, there are just too many hard factual weird things about he world, politics, and history.  And these facts are completely ignored by the mainstream narrative and often run counter to them.</p>
<p>It might not seem like much, but it's hard not to conclude that "something" is going on.</p></p>

<p><p>Looks like concern trolling central on the thread - Despite the clear police suspect renderings and all the rest - I think they're just as sick to discourage the investigative effort and should BTFO - No one helping here is the FBI or agency with the tools or powers to fully flush out leads. They are leads. We may get hard evidence but the critics probably have a few kids locked up in their basement</p></p>

<p><p>I do not want to trap us into the CFR event idea as I had read it somewhere, and it was just one possibility. I found that the CFR site only seems to list events in the US but not overseas, but they do have meetings in other regions. There are other possible reasons to be in Portugal mentioned earlier. We need to keep an open mind as we keep building leads.</p></p>

<p><p>Very interesting article that helps explain why you have seen some odd behavior in trying to get to ground in the Madeleine case. It is like salmon swimming upstream when you have the politically-connected, the judicial system, high government officials, and the media fighting to protect their perverted ways.</p></p>

<p><p>Here's the people related to Freud:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Caitlin Klevorick, worked/works for Hillary/Podesta. She's related to Freud comm. through her ex-boss Matthew Hiltzik from Hitzik Strategies, who founded Freud Comm. and is also related to Harvey Weinstein (a friend)... who by proxy, is related to Mark Cuban through his partner Todd Wagner. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freud Communication donated to TerraMar, owned by Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ester Freud wrote a book called "Hideous Kinky" that has some pedophile flavor to it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The husband of Emma Freud, Richard Curtis, did the shocking 10:10 campaign (NSFW: https://youtu.be/FS5CH-Xc0co)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elisabeth Murdoch might be connected but know that Rupert Murdoch "enemy" was the father of Ghislaine Maxwell. Father and daughter might not share the same agenda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Freud family also seems to be very big and not all close to each others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These info come from Wikipedia or their own websites. Nothing secret.</p></p>

<p><p>This is a combination of verifiable stuff and easily disprovable non-sense. Once people get a hold of the non-sense, they will use that to discredit facts. Please delete this and re-post with 100% verifiable facts. </p>
<p>This serves to discredit the whole thing. </p></p>

<p><p>Are you a shill/troll? You seem to have a track record of downplaying legitimate leads and information, not just here but elsewhere. Those reading, please click on his name to see his history of telling people to close down their investigation...nothing here!</p>
<p>The way to build a case is to follow leads and go where they take you. Some of the leads turn out to be dead ends, or bad intel, so you close those down. You don't close down a whole thread with good thinking because it includes some conjecture, ideas not yet proven NOR disproven. Most of what we have in this thread is consistent and not in any way contradicted so far. If there was no CFR meeting, that does not disprove a trip to Portugal. It was one idea of many posited in this thread.</p></p>

<p><p>No, just someone who has been working on this for over a month and knows that the quickest way to delegitimize all of our hard work is by posting non-sense and openly accusing people before we have enough evidence, that way they can't cover their tracks. </p>
<p>I can't speak for alts, but you've been here for 11 hours. You don't know what you're talking about, and people like you are ruining any chance of turning something useful. </p></p>

<p><p>With face recognition or expert analysis, it could be determined if this is same child. I also remember reading about a unique pattern on one of her irises (pupils). Then, easily, DNA comparison to parents or siblings can be pretty conclusive. Are authorities involved?  Those mug shots are just too much!   </p></p>

<p><p>Eye witness testimony from Charlotte Pennington:</p>
<p><strong>CHARLOTTE PENNINGTON (20) Year 2007 (Mark Warner Nanny)</strong></p>
<p><em>Former Mark Warner nanny Charlotte Pennington said she spotted the man in a small dinghy just off the Praia da Luz seafront at 11.30pm. She claims he was kicking at an object stored in the boat's hull. When she moved closer to investigate, the man - whose name she has given to Portuguese and British police - stooped out of sight then hurriedly rowed away.</em></p>

<p><p>At this point it's a matter of getting this information to more people, because if you don't believe this after such facts you gotta be intentionally not-accepting truth. Too many coincidences at this point.</p></p>

<p><p>The incongruity I see in this line of thinking is that it ignores the findings of the Portuguese investigators.  The cadaver dogs clearly tied a dead body to the McCann's room and the car they rented many days after their daughter's disappearance.  If Podesta was involved in an abduction, what did the dog find?<br/>
The investigator indicated the parents used a sedative on the children to make the sleep while they had dinner.  It seems likely that the drugged girl woke and injured herself or died tragically and the parents didn't want to be exposed as selfish &amp; negligent so they tried to cover it up with the abduction story.  </p>

<p><p>If you look at the "cards" picture closely, and compare her to any other picture of Madeleine, all features, all spacing between features, her unique ears, her age, resemblance to mother (with father's nose and coloring. The girl in the photo is Madeleine McCann, and I don't see anything abnormal about the photo. Before 4Chan was wiped of it all, one poster named the source as the NYPD.</p></p>
