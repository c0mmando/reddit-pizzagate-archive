<p><p>Notice that all of the Wikileaks email accounts are from clintonmail.com and not clintonEmail.com as ATS has on their page. </p>
<p>They aren't the same domain name. </p>
<p>Interesting note: </p>
<p>The Clintonmail.com domain doesn't have private registration and is registered under Diane Clinton, which is Hillary's middle name. It also has the address of a normal house in Illinois. Kinda odd. </p></p>

<p><p>~~I'm a computer sysadmin who manages Outlook 2010 servers, which are nearly identical to Hillary's private server, and wanted to provide some insight: There's no doubt that this email exists on their server. Also, if the sysadmin wanted to remove the mailbox, it would be a matter of two mouse clicks to make it happen.~~  </p>
<p>~~A quick Google-search for the term "catamite-in-chief" shows that this is a term that has been used to refer to Obama in an insulting manner for years, so perhaps it was made as a joke.~~   </p>
<p>~~Let me know if there are any questions about Outlook 2010 accounts, mailboxes, etc.~~  </p>
<p>Edit: Scratch everything, it looks like safeguards are in place on their server that I'm unfamiliar with, so requests to verify the existence of the mailbox reach the server and go no further. Basically it's giving a false-positive.</p></p>

<p><p>~~Sure thing. Using verify-email.org, we can send a request to the email server basically asking "Does this mailbox exist?". This is referred to as an RCPT command, and can have one of four replies:~~ <br/>
   ~~ 250: Mailbox exists~~ <br/>
    ~~251: Mailbox not found, but message has been forwarded~~ <br/>
    ~~550: Mailbox not found and no further action taken~~ <br/>
    ~~551: Mailbox not found, try this address instead~~   </p>
<p>~~Since verify-email.org returned 250 for catamite-in-chief@clintonemail.com, we can confirm that it is currently active on the mailserver.~~</p>
<p>Edit: Scratch everything, I tried with random numbers/letters and still received a reply of 250. It looks like safeguards are in place on their server that I'm unfamiliar with, so requests reach the server and go no further. Basically it's giving a false-positive.</p></p>

<p>Ok so you can neither confirm nor deny the abovetopsecret story? And it's very possible that they wrongly thought that the 250 on calamite-in-chief lead them wrong? I mean you wrongly assumed at first as well.</p></p>

<p><p>Awe man those ATS guys are dumber than a box of rocks...and hysterically their moto is "deny ignorance". They were stupid over this...you know why? Because the tards never went to wikileaks and ever read the emails or they'd know obama's fake email was bobama@ameritech.com</p>
<p>HA butthurt ATS tards.</p></p>
