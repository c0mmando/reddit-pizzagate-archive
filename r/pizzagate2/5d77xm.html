<strong>How to overcome this?</strong>
<p><p>What I'm going to say is a matter of opinion so take it as such. A lot of thought went into this and I hope it reaches someone, even if this garners no replies.</p>
<p>It is safe to say that this all came about because of all of us. We allowed this to happen. Even though it was done in secrecy and through tactics of silence, it was still our fault.</p>
<p>When a person is isolated they become vulnerable. They want any input they can get. This goes for people of influence and this goes for the innocent child. People with ill-intent realize this also, but there is still another problem that needs to be addressed. Where does happiness come from?</p>
<p>You get money, are you happy? You get esctacy through drugs or sex, are you happy? You have power over people, are you happy? These are all disconnected and fleeting feelings of happiness, it's never enough. So where does true happiness come from? That's the human struggle and that's the opposite of anti-christ cults.</p>
<p>If we open ourselves to the idea that we lie to ourselves more than we like to admit we can overcome our own obstacles and ultimately bring about unity.</p></p>

<p><p>This is not our fault. Happiness comes from within, and it doesn't involve hurting children. Maybe these people get some temporary enjoyment from stealing innocence, but they are not happy. To some people happiness is helping others; to others happiness is a warm gun. </p></p>

<p><p>I agree with you that happiness comes from within, but lets say the devil made a deal with you and it gave you a position of power. These deals are irreversible as we're seeing today. Their free will has been taken from them because otherwise it results in death.</p></p>

<p><p>Death is a better choice than what they're doing. The bible says that for people like this, they're better off having a millstone strung around their necks and drowned in the ocean than to continue doing what they do.</p></p>

<p><p>Well this goes to my idea of isolation; I'm sure you've heard the phrase "divide and conquer." If they realized and admitted to their crimes, what do you think their punishment should be? The first step to bettering one's self.</p></p>
