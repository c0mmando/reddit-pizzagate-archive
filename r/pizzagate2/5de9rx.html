<strong>Strange employee bios on the website of the IT company owned by Bill Havre</strong>
<p><p>In light of everything else that's surfacing, these bios just seem really odd...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bryan is a certified pentester and doomsayer for Zanarkand. He grew up on the southern tip of Antarctica and was raised by penguins. A kindly sea captain picked him up when he turned fourteen; upon returning to port, the sea captain promptly retired and married Bryan, and they have been together ever since.</p>
<p>Jane is VP of Customer Relations for Zanarkand. Trained as a cryptozoologist, Jane gained acclaim from an early age for discovering definitive proof of the existence of the Jersey Devil. Shortly afterwards, however, she realized man was the strangest animal of them all and left the field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest are also equally cryptic: https://www.z-sec.io/about.html</p></p>

<p><p>In the FAQ section, one of the questions asked is: what are the strange symbols at the bottom of the website. There's a thread in PizzaGate linking this to the missing McCann case. Not sure how true or reliable or solid the connection is, but this reveals that the website owner is aware of the symbols and are not afraid to bring people's attention to it. What does it mean? </p></p>

<p><p>You mean the whole thing, or the reading/translation of the cipher? The site's been around for around/over a year though, before all this broke out.</p></p>
