<strong>Blurred Private Message Photo FB</strong>
<p><p>FB is involved heavily. On my private messaging on my real account they blurred an image that I shared involving Pizzagate. No other images when retrieved presented the same blur. Wish me luck and continuation in life. Be careful! </p></p>

<p><p>Would it be possible to screenshot the original pic before uploading, and the pic on facebook for validation?</p></p>

<p><p>When you first send pictures, a lot of times it puts a heavily compressed version up first, then follows up with the high quality version.  I see this happen a lot when I'm sharing things in FB messenger on my PC.  </p>
<p>I wouldn't jump to any conclusions on it until you can document a clear pattern of it happening over a length of time</p></p>

<p><p>Using #pizzgate in a status makes your post invisible on other peoples news feed. I tested it out and even my girlfriend who is usually notified topmost of my posts never saw the posting with #pizzagate in the status. Then I tried without and it was at the top most recent for her and received likes by others.</p>
<p>Facebook is under the guise of protecting an innocent pizza store owner... Why haven't they done similar things to the other harassment brigades in recent memory like Cecil the lion guy or thousands of threats railed at female hunters etc. They've never censored hashtags like this as far as I know.</p></p>

<p><p>I tried PMing a friend a pic of She-Obama with a sign that said "Trump touched my penis".  It would not let me send the image.  Tried another one and it worked.  My guess is you could probably confirm this yourself with the info I have provided.</p></p>

<p><p>At this point I'd imagine I'm already on their radar for discussing with friends and family on social networks. I am not compromising myself any further. </p>
<p>Run a test yourself by sharing one of the Instagram photos with questionable comments and you'll see they blur it so you can't read the text. </p>
<p>The user also showed away for a while and the messages showed up as seen. Can't validate if that's normal behavior. I've set up a lot of failsafe already to inform people that I have no intention of suicide and am in good health and that if I'm compromised people should look into shit. </p>
<p>I'd love for nothing more than for all of this to be a big hoax right now.</p></p>

<p><p>Open chrome if you're using Firefox (or the opposite), and open another FB account. </p></p>

<p><p>Can you screenshot this? I'm not going to go off of: "See for yourself and send a picture"</p>
<p>This sub is going to go quickly off the rails with speculation on top of more speculation unless everyone can offer photographic proof of the things they allege. </p></p>
