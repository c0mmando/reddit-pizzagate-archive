<strong>Question about pizza.jpg</strong>
<p><p>I have read explanations for the now infamous pizza.jpg image, and I seem to recall that people explaining it away as an old image from a trip Clinton took to North Korea (please correct me if I am wrong).  The reason I ask is that I can find no instance of the image prior to the 11/4/2016, and I want to steganalyze it against the original.  All of the ones I can find are from the podesta leaks.</p>
<p>I should have started with this image but I was going through the powerpoints from lo_johnson and have just now had time to go back to this jpg.  Let me know if someone knows of any earlier instances of this image on the internet.  </p>
<p>Thanks!</p></p>

<p>I'm guessing there's no record of the image existing online before 11/4/2016 because it was privately exchanged by Podesta and Co., not published in the media anywhere.</p></p>

<p><p>I have my doubts that wikileaks would ever spread cp even through their leaked emails, which could be why the first email of this that was leaked had no attachment, but the next leak of it suddenly did. There may have been steganography in the original, and wl edited it out.</p></p>

<p><p>there was an r/outtheloop thread about pizzagate, where someone explained that pizza.jpg was a photo from Bill Clinton's visit to North Korea to rescue two investigators.  If this were true I would assume the pictures were not first circulated in the Podesta emails, and that there would be older versions on the web.  </p>
<p>Interestingly, that thread has disappeared...</p></p>
