<strong>Possible New Lead: Norfolk Academy &amp; Norfolk Virginia Child Abuse - connected with Comet Ping Pong</strong>
<p><p>I think I might've uncovered a new Pizzagate lead. It's not that solid, but it is something, and gives us some new directions to look while establishing some more vague connections.</p>
<p>It started with an image on google I found while searching for comet ping pong:</p>
<p>http://www.literacyfellows.org/comet-pizza/</p>
<p>This link led me to look into Literacy Fellows, which is a program for advanced learning within Norfolk Academy. The program director is a Dr. David Kidd, who is a teacher at Norfolk Academy. It seems like the program picks out advanced students and then they go on a number of field trips helping out impoverished communities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As part of the Norfolk Academy Center for Civic and Global Leadership, the Literacy Fellows Program engages high-achieving students to understand, communicate, and solve the national and global issues inextricably linked to literacy. Understanding that abilities with reading and writing are crucial for empowered and responsible citizens, the Literacy Fellows Program serves to advance literacy as a way to break cycles of poverty in Hampton Roads and beyond. Fellows work alongside Norfolk Academy faculty to grow in their own writing aptitude, while collaborating with outside organizations and communities to gain first-hand knowledge of the far-reaching implications of literacy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the blog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before going to an author’s reading at DC’s famous bookstore Politics and Prose, the ’19 Literacy Fellows had dinner at Comet Pizza, which looked like an ordinary pizza place. However, there was something special: they had ping pong. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this could all just be a simple field trip to see an author speak at a bookstore. Nothing more to see. But there was a connection. Did you catch the name of the bookstore?</p>
<p>That's right, it's Hillary's favorite bookstore, right down the street from Comet Pizza. I think this is the post about the author they went to see:
http://www.literacyfellows.org/ari-berman-at-politics-and-prose/</p>
<p>He writes for The Nation, and seems pro-DNC (an article he has is titled Ari Berman - This Election is Being Rigged - But Not By Democrats) could dig into him a little bit but doesn't seem too relevant.</p>
<p><strong>So lets explore more:</strong></p>
<p>First of all, its a 4h drive (or 1hr flight) from Norfolk to Washington. 
<a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/dir/1585+Wesleyan+Drive,+Norfolk,+VA+23502,+USA/Comet+Ping+Pong,+5037+Connecticut+Ave+NW,+Washington,+DC+20008,+USA/@38.1643264,-76.785639,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89ba9689aa6b4e1b:0x658044aa5eba5b11!2m2!1d-76.1936348!2d36.873487!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c9b98f61ad27:0x81a8bf734dd1c58f!2m2!1d-77.0699666!2d38.9559497?hl=en">See map here</a>
Its not a stretch to think they would travel to DC for a field trip, and it does seem like they go all over the place, so that doesn't seem out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of things that stand out as weird:</p>
<p>1 - Dr. David Kidd</p>
<p>2 - Norfolk Academy</p>
<p>Dr. Kidd is probably just a normal teacher, but he seems to spend a lot of time with with young girls from Norfolk Academy travelling.</p>
<p>http://www.literacyfellows.org/center-for-book-arts-826nyc-greenlight-bookstore-meeting-with-julianne-escobedo-shepherd/</p>
<p>We've seen in the past that most powerful people hiding something tend to place themselves close to it. Many of these pedophile organizations are somehow tied to kids charities, disability centers, and other places related to kids. The recent discovery about the daycare is an example, Jimmy Savile and his work with kids is another. Everything is tied to the kids.
The other weird thing to note, his linked in says he was a teacher in Spokane until 1996, which is when Clinton &amp; Co. moved to the white house. That's when he moved to Norfolk Academy.</p>
<p>English Chair</p>
<p>Norfolk Academy</p>
<p>August 2000 – Present (16 years 4 months)</p>
<p>English Teacher</p>
<p>Norfolk Academy, Norfolk, VA</p>
<p>August 1996 – Present (20 years 4 months)</p>
<p>English Teacher</p>
<p>Saint George's School, Spokane, WA</p>
<p>August 1992 – June 1996 (3 years 11 months)</p>
<p>So, did anything interesting happen in or around Spokane around that time?
Unfortuanately, you probably guessed it already. One of the biggest child abuse scandals in history.</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenatchee_child_abuse_prosecutions</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1995, forty-three adults were arrested on 29,726 charges of child sex abuse, involving 60 children; Child Protective Services removed some fifty children from accused parents and relocated them in foster homes.[5][6] Parents and Sunday school teachers were charged, and many were convicted of abusing children, often including their own, or their foster children. While some were released, eighteen pleaded guilty, mostly on the basis of signed confessions. All who confessed later recanted; stating that they were threatened that unless they confessed, they would never see their children again. Others claimed they were told that if they confessed they would be treated in the community, rather than go to prison. Many said they were told that if they signed, their children wouldn't be placed in foster care or put up for adoption. Ten were convicted at trial. Three were acquitted. Eighteen went to prison.
Sure gives you a reason to get the fuck out of dodge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, in 1995 a 12 year old gave birth in a Spokane Hospital
Washington State paid her $3m to avoid trial. Possible cover-up? We've seen this before (ie. Marc Turi weapons case)
http://www.pcvalaw.com/woman-settles-child-abuse-case-for-3000000/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The State of Washington has agreed to pay $3,000,000 to a woman, identified only by her initials R.R., who alleges Child Protective Services failed to protect her after she gave birth when she was just 12 years old and entered state protective care.  R.R. alleges the same man, her mother’s boyfriend, impregnated her again within two months after she gave birth and continued to sexually and physically abuse her over the next decade while he held her captive and she raised his sons.  The settlement will allow the State to avoid a jury trial that was previously scheduled to begin today in Tacoma, Washington.
In January 1995, Washington State’s Child Protective Services was notified that R.R., a sixth grader at the time, had just given birth at Deaconess Hospital in Spokane, Washington.  Given her age and lack of prenatal care, the hospital’s workers asked CPS to investigate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now lets look at Norfolk Academy. Why does it stand out as strange?</p>
<p>It is a private school ($18-23k+ a year) for children grades 1-12. It dates back to 1728.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Academy
http://www.norfolkacademy.org/page/admissions/tuition-and-financial-aid</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Super elite school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>spans entire childhood</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2008 a teacher was being investigated for having a relationship with a 17yr girl:
http://www.topix.com/forum/source/wavy/TCHVAUA7MUMR1T32C
So we have an elite private school for kids grades 1-12, 4 hours away from Washington its in Norfolk. For those who don't know, that is CIA country.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Norfolk has a long history as a strategic military and transportation point. The largest Navy base in the world, Naval Station Norfolk, is located in Norfolk along with one of NATO's two Strategic Command headquarters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Norfolk gives me the creeps. Just spend some time digging around child abuse, satanic ritual abuse + Norfolk/Virginia. There seems to be so much to go through (don't confuse this with the HUGE pedophile case in Norfolk, Norwich England). Due to the huge Naval Base, it seems there are numerous reports of human trafficking and child abuse. </p>
<p><strong>So what do we have?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A huge naval base with a history of being implicated in satanic ritual abuse, a central hub for this stuff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A super elite private school for children grades 1-12, where a teacher was previously implicated in sexual abuse of a minor (17 year old girl)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A different teacher who runs a special program for a small group of high achieving children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travels all over with said children (him and 5 young girls go to NYC)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They travel to Politics &amp; Prose in DC (Hillary's Favorite Bookstore)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They go to Comet Ping Pong</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Does this tie the Norfolk Academy into everything? We've seen private schools (namely boys schools) be used numerous times for child abuse.</p>
<p>Also, checkout this Sex Trafficking charity in Norfolk. Creepy AF.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Overview: News reports state that self-described Satanist Russell John Smith, 38, a former guard at the Prince William County jail and founder of a satanic worship group on the internet, plead guilty to four counts of rape. He claimed that most of the sex acts with a 12 year old girl were part of his Satanic rituals. Police who searched his home found numerous Satanic items, including robes, black candles, goat’s skull, a pentagram and an altar. See “Virginia Fugitive Arrested in Oregon,” Associated Press, Sept. 4, 2002; “Self-described Satanist Sentenced to 48 years for Rape,” Associated Press, July 25, 2003; “Sentencing Delayed for Satanist who Raped Girl,” Associated Press, June 19, 2003; “Metro in Brief,” The Washington Post, July 28, 2003 </p>

<p>Overview: News report states Terry Dale Duncan, 30, a self-styled Satanic high priest, pleaded no contest in an attempt to murder his one month old son. His child would have died if not for the intervention of a nurse and social worker after the child missed a doctor’s appointment. Duncan’s child had suffered fractures to a leg, a shinbone, both collarbones, and bruises covered his nose, forehead and eyes. The authorities also discovered a wound that appeared to be a cigarette burn at the back of his throat. </p>

<p><strong>February 6, 1996, SUZANNE HUGHES v. DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ARLINGTON COUNTY, COURT OF APPEALS OF VIRGINIA, 1996 Va. LEXIS 77, Termination of Parental Rights Affirmed</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overview: Appellate documents state a baby was removed from the custody of the mother, Suzanne Hughes, after evidence of abuse. The mother was eventually diagnosed with Multiple Personality Disorder. The child was returned to her, but after further incidents of abuse and neglect, she was taken into custody again. The mother's counselor testified that the mother stated she was involved with a Satanic cult that killed adults and babies, and they had threatened her. She stated she was involved with them since she was 7 yrs. old and she reported members of the cult abducting and raping her.</p>
<p>Under cross-examination, the mother was asked about the maternal grandparent’s failure in reporting her own abuse, and the court was concerned that she was living at the maternal grandfather's home. The trial judge expressed concern over the continued existence of the Satanic cult, appellant's inability to help the police prosecute a member of this cult, appellant's continued residence in the same family home where she had been verbally and physically abused as a small child, and lack of family support that was missing when appellant was an abused child. </p>
<p>The appellate court found that the evidence of Ms. Hughes participation in the cult described was relevant to the proceedings.</p>

<p><p>Can I also just point out that... Why the hell is everyone obsessed with ping pong? "However, there was something special: they had ping pong."</p>
<p>That is not that special. Ping pong kind of sucks. It's like going to a bar and being amazed at them having a pool table or darts. Definitely something weird there.</p></p>

<p><p>I don't often see "Friend of" on business websites. Sort of like the babysitting website linked to their massage business. It's just odd. It doesn't make practical sense unless you have customers going to your site looking for affiliates, which most customers just go to the place directly. They don't lurk on the site.</p>
<p>Also Politics and Prose has "The Den" which is directly connected to "The Little Red Fox" nearby, a cafe. They connected after opening. Both logos feature the same illustrated red fox.</p></p>

<p><p>I went to this school. </p>
<p>Don't mean to be a downer but I highly doubt anyone at the school is involved in the trafficking of kids/satanism. </p>
<p>Mr. Kidd (at the time I went there) is extremely well liked. Now, that is NOT to say that he is involved in shady activity. I would even go as far as to say that those that are in high positions of authority do tend to exhibit deviant behavior. But this school? I just don't see it. Most of my classmates attended from 1st grade all the way to graduation. If there was something going on it would completely destroy the school. </p>
<p>Going on a witch hunt implicating innocent people can backfire on us when it comes to investigating occult activity. Just my .02 </p></p>

<p><p>nothing i say will prove to you that i'm not a shill. i'm a truthseeker just as much as everyone else on this sub. the ISSUE is that if you start implicating innocent people it can backfire. no amount of what i say will make you believe me. I went to this school, and the time that I was there, did not have anything fishy going on.</p></p>

<p><p>If you read about Fiona Barnett, who was victimized by the Australian branch of Project Monarch (Dr. Gittinger, Dr. Antony Kidman), the mind control handlers had special interest in highly intelligent children.</p></p>
