<strong>My story about a hot dog stand and some rough internal things: emailID 30231</strong>
<p><p>Let me tell you a story of an email between JP and I think Todd Stern (tdstern) correct me if I'm wrong</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30231</p>
<p><strong>Original text:</strong></p>
<p>The next three months are going to be rougher internally than in 
<em>Beijing.</em> Between <em>7th</em> and <em>1600</em>, no fun. Hope you're doing ok. 
I'm dreaming about your <em>hotdog</em> stand in Hawaii...</p>
<p>Complete Speculation but let me explain the key words to you:</p>
<p><em>7th</em> (class) is the range of age a person has when he or she is in 
7th class in school (eg.1 - 8th class possible)</p>
<p><em>1600</em> should be a monetary value, plain and simple.</p>
<p>He (Stern) refers to it (<em>Between 7th and 1600</em>) not being <em>fun</em>.
Maybe he would have preferred something like "3rd" and "300".
Maybe he had some of those in Beijing , that has been less "<em>rough</em>"</p>
<p>we know there have been a lot of rumours about Hawaii, I guess you can imagine
what that private <em>HotDog Stand</em> could be.</p>
<p>Whats your idea about this? I know some have been talking about this mail, but 
I thought this would be an attempt to give every line of words a certain meaning.</p>
<p>Todd Stern was at least in 2009 in Bejing.

<p><p>I was thinking the 1600 has to do with the Whitehouse, which is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. </p></p>

<p><p>I think it refers to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (the White House) and the 7th Floor Group, ie the shadow government referenced in the FBI vault postings.</p></p>

<p><p>I think 7th and 1600 refer to two offices... the White House and maybe something on 7th Street in DC? I didn't see any addresses associated with Stern's positions that would qualify (the closest would be 7 World Trade Center NYC, which is associated with Wilmer Hale, where he once worked... in anti-money-laundering, interestingly). The only really suspect thing about this email is the hotdog stand statement.</p></p>
