<p><p>For what it's worth, I know someone who is a pretty big actor but a little younger and he was invited for a large cash sum just to show up at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Azim_of_Brunei">Prince Azim of Brunei</a>'s party. Was very strange invite and now this makes more sense.</p></p>

<p><p>Not sure why this hasn't had more attention. This is a big part in connecting the dots here. </p>
<p>Some links I found in regards to Brunei and Bill:</p>
<p>Huffpost of course being biased, reporting only on her fashion, but I am just establishing her connections here:
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/06/hillary-clinton-photo-style-brunei-china_n_1861487.html</p>
<p>REALLY great subreddit that has been investigating the Clinton Foundation. With this much evidence, these people should be in prison.

<p>For those who may not have seen the flight logs of Bill on Epsteins plane:
http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/05/13/flight-logs-show-bill-clinton-flew-on-sex-offenders-jet-much-more-than-previously-known.html</p>
<p>I bet the Rothschilds and Rockafellers and all these big dynasties and families absolutely hate the internet. If we didn't have this resource we wouldn't be able to connect these dots. Wouldn't it be some shit if it comes out that the big bills on internet restriction was being funded by these fucks? (sorry for the tiny rant)</p></p>
