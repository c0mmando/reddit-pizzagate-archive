<p><p>GUYS! I just spoke with the woman who posted this. She knew Monica directly and contacted sources in Colorado where the Human Trafficking Center us located. (Their fb made a statement on Monicas death) </p>
<p>this is what the woman told me: Ok I checked with my people in CO.  They say " She committed suicide. She left a note. She felt overwhelmed by a number of things that weren't panning out in Haiti. I wish she would've told someone but she didn't. The only person who knew was her BF who had flown to the states for his father's funeral. He is devastated. Many people are in shock.</p>
<p>Btw her family didn't know about her advocacy work in behalf of sex workers.  Billie knew her very well. Monica was hiding it from her family. We should be thoughtful regarding that I suppose, even though I want to publicly thank her for what she was doing. Not sure how to approach it. I'll be at the memorial service on Friday. </p>
<p>I can post a screenshot as well in my own post if you guys would like</p></p>

<p><p>Given the information already dug up this seems like the most relevant lead thus far, how are any of our efforts going to make a difference though? I mean, who would we even forward this too, it's all too possible that FBI, CIA ect. are most likely privy to information like this already, just feels kind of hopeless right now.</p></p>

<p><p>Haiti hates the Clintons...there is a decent chance their government would cooperate with an actual investigation into her death.  Infowars did some work in Haiti during the election, this might be something to put them on if possible.  Joe Biggs perhaps.</p></p>

<p><p>That it seems like anyone who makes an attempt to engage these people winds up suiciding themselves. </p>
<p>I mean, this work needs to be done, but common Internet sleuths physically going out and exploring these places is fucking insane. Going to the third world to investigate the Clintons? I'd be bringing Seal Team fucking Six. </p>
<p>The documentary "Gringo" about John McAfee shows what money can buy you in poor places around the world. He was one guy with some money, and had a police force and a private posse of criminals protecting him and threatening/killing people who got in his way. The Clintons are 100x what McAfee is. This girl was naive/insane to think she could roll into Haiti by herself and ask questions that would implicate groups of people with net worth in the billions.</p></p>

<p><p>I honestly can't see them being brought down by the F.B.I, the C.I.A or people in our own Government. I honestly don't even see a world wide joint task force of law enforcement bringing down the Clintons. Trump might have a chance. I feel like this is up to the citizens with cold hard facts to bring truth and justice. I mean every time there's something or someone involved with Clintons that ends up dying or coming to light nothing ever gets done to bear down real justice on them. Are they protected by some dark forces? Like what in the actual fuck? Our own intelligence community won't even do anything about it. 
Edit: This denial or inability to dole out justice from our own government also hampers on our ability to help government in time of need. It's all one fucked up injustice. </p></p>

<p><p>You're not wrong. Are you suggesting we not hire a firm of private investigators to look into this? Edit: I have no intention of spending out internet sleuths nor would I advise anyone on doing so. I'm suggesting we hire a top notch firm of private investigators. </p></p>

<p><p>She needs to go to the FBI. They may not be able to do a lot until Loretta Lynch is gone, but they can at least document this stuff, the Haiti connections, maybe even get an inquest going regarding Monica's death and the research she was doing. </p></p>

<p><p>tl;dr</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real significance of this scandal ... is human trafficking happening through the Clinton's Caraol Complex. 
****That's two huge human trafficking scandals, an environmental degradation scandal, a social displacement scandal, a Presidential election scandal, a scandal with billions in unaccounted for earthquake aid.... all leading directly back to the Clintons racist cronyism in Haiti.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additional (shorter) post: https://i.sli.mg/ItSG4n.png</p>
<p>tl;dr - "Some wisdom you can only get from fieldwork. Quite the scandal... If the Clintons plan to disseminate Haiti with their gold looting... I guess we know why Martelly's guy is set to steal the elections....[sic] Ms. Clinton has corrupt &amp; dirty business to finish in Haiti. The people suffer so."</p>

<p><p>This in lies the problem, the biggest mistake people investigating it make is making themselves known. It's tragic what happened to her but she played the role of the sacrifice hoping that her namesake would be enough to keep her alive, and it didn't.</p>
<p>Situations like this, you have to be vocal, but also secretive, attempting to create an alias that is ignorant to it all. You can't go on a solo run to investigate a scandal on this level because what's at stake here is a lot of people's political clout.</p>
<p>They will gladly kill a single woman to silence her and make it look like a suicide because she is in a foreign land surrounded by the enemy.</p>
<p>You have to play it smarter than that. You have to get into the head of these sick people, learn their lingo, stake out hot spots, casually comment on certain interest and integrate yourself into the world without getting in to deep. </p>
<p>You have to try and reveal yourself as one of them without revealing your true intentions. If she went on commenting about Clinton or George Soros, she was a dead gal walking. However if you just go around comment on adoption, or looking at the options, or pizza and hot dog, or if carrying a colored handkerchief actually works as a calling card you can get in.</p>
<p>Though your face is also very telling, you can't be disgusted by what's being said or being done, if you see the evil going on, you have to sadly roll with it, remind yourself this already happened to a bunch of children and in order to stop this you have to fight through and sadly let it happen while you think of the greater good.</p>
<p>It's scary, while I can do my best to express the best way to get into it, I'd never have the courage to do it myself, just way to much risk of blowing your cover and then your in the Wolve's Den as good as suicide(dead). Drugged, hanged, needle, in a room by yourself. Door locked, fingerprints wiped, cops paid off. It's way to easy to cover their tracks since they have the money to pull it off.</p></p>

<p><p>Very good question. Will have an answer shortly. Checking into it now.</p>
<p>Still digging but have found a link.</p>
<p>Tony Rodham is associated with Greentech Automotives. GA was founded by Charles B Wang, located in Massachusetts. He's also connected to The National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children.</p>
<p>I'm still digging but that's the basic link I've found.</p></p>

<p><p>What no one seems to be pointing out with regards to all these suicides...Real suicides, information/note is broadcast FIRST, then suicide comes next. Not getting the message out, but instead taking it to the grave is abnormal and unlikely. Most suicidal people attempt to make peace with the world before they go. This "note" might tell more but I doubt it.</p></p>

<p><p>There are two different spellings of her last name going on here. You're doing both "Peterson" and "Petersen."  The correct spelling (according to her Facebook account) is "Petersen."  - just sayin'</p></p>
