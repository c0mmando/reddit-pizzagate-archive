<strong>Can we get this to Kanye?</strong>
<p><p>He's been creating a lot of controversy with pro-Trump and anti-establishment/anti-media rants at his shows recently. He is risking his career and his life to red pill the masses. He has the ability to reach millions. And now he is the father to a young child. He would be the perfect advocate and spokesman.</p>
<p>Pizzagate is picking up momentum, and this could really push it over the top and bring it into the mainstream. Exposure is the only way we are going to get these sickos, and Kanye could be the vehicle for that. If we can make him aware of this through tweets and hashtags (idk how this shit works) it could be a huge lift to the cause.</p>
<p>I don't know if I'm way off base here but this satanic child rape shit HAS to end and I feel powerless as a nobody. If someone of notoriety took this information to the top, we'd have more power behind us to take these people down and stop this from ever happening to another child again.</p></p>

<p><p>I've thought about this too. Kanye is also an outspoken Christian. He could blow this thing up with one tweet. Everyone tweet him about Pizzagate and send him this very good video summary by a Christian man https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkmT4O0LGYQ  </p></p>

<p><p>The sextape was leaked by Ray J and she took an opportunistic clever option.</p>
<p>Instead of letting some dickhead ex destroy her daughter, she sued and got her daughter a fat amount of money and publicity out of it. </p>
<p>That's clever turning shit into gold management.</p></p>

<p><p>not only that when they explore criminal enterprises they dont blur faces or change/bleep names. people come forward to give insight into dark markets under the understanding they will be protected and vice does em dirty by exposing their names and faces. so not only do they not have safety thru authorities for whistleblowing on their enterprise they are likely dead in a ditch thru ID of their enterprise. but at this point whats the difference between the authorities and a criminal enterprise. they cooperate. vice feeds the whistleblowers to the system.</p></p>

<p><p>Good idea, but if you do it, make sure you summarize it really well and "dumb it down" for him. Not because I think he's stupid, but it's a complicated topic and he might get bored after a couple sentences and blow it off.</p></p>

<p><p>They can't kill anyone famous or well-known that speaks out about this. It would be too obvious and would bring more attention and credibility to the "theory"</p>
<p>They would try to discredit him instead.</p></p>

<p><p>All the people hanging from Kanye's nuts all of a sudden just because hes been praising Trump are pants on head.</p>
<p>2 weeks ago nobody here would have taken him seriously if he alerted us the sky was blue. Now hes our hero and is going to take down pedorings? The Einsteins over at whereisassange are doing the same bullshit "QUICK ALERT KANYE" you all sound so fucking stupid right now.</p>
<p>FUCK KANYE WEST. I don't give a shit if he wanted to vote for Trump or not.</p>
<p>Not to mention I'm sure each and every one of you thought or said how stupid it was every time another Hollywood Clinton supporter came out of the woodwork "Nobody cares what you fucking think about politics you shitty actor/actress/whatever" Stop being hypocrites people. Again - FUCK KANYE WEST.</p></p>

<p><p>Fair enough. We are in strange times, I don't know what else to do. Figured there's a lot of ears/eyes on him right now and could be a good avenue to approach this from. Or could be a disaster. I do appreciate the criticisms.</p></p>

<p><p>Sorry, I wasn't trying to single you out specifically. I can understand the idea being floated around.. I just can't understand the hive mind nodding its head every time someone does going "Great idea! Kanye will fix this!"</p>
<p>Not to mention Kanye has talked about running for president. I think we all need to take two giant steps away from Kanye and stop playing with the dumpster fire. That guy will burn us sooner or later.</p></p>

<p><p>I can agree with this. I saw Kanye as a potential conduit to raise awareness, not necessarily the saviour. At this point maybe Infowars would be a better place to bring this?</p></p>

<p><p>I think almost anything except for Kanye is a great idea. Celebrities in general, lets avoid them.... we laugh at the Democrats when they do it.</p>
<p>Infowars/Breitbart/Random youtubers/flyers in your local neighborhood. I'm really not trying to say don't spread the word.. just fuck kanye and celebrities as a whole...but especially Kanye.</p></p>

<p><p>I agree Infowars would be the best bet at this point. Strange times, just gauging the waters. When I first posted this I thought there could be a chance for potential but the more I think about it there seems to be more risks involved than benefits. Infowars is a much better shot at awareness.</p></p>

<p><p>We may just have to wait until Trump takes office to hopefully learn more. Even if he is aware of whats happening there is probably only so much he can do in regards to a lot of the current issues we are having ....Assange, Soros, etc. </p>
<p>I'm not saying to stop trying, just trying to give some hope to the situation.</p></p>

<p><p>That's a good thing to keep in mind. Most people are of the opinion that it was planned out and intentional, possibly to set the table and get people to pay attention to something bigger in the future. I wonder if there will be anything tonight? Not saying this is the perfect plan but this has to blow up somehow.</p></p>

<p><p>Has anyone else noticed how strange his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kanyewest/">Instagram</a> page is?</p>
<p>I know he's super into fashion, and supposedly it's an "art" instalation. But if you look at the way the pictures flow, they create bodies divided into head/shoulder, then torso, then legs/feet etc. They don't all do that or follow that pattern, but it seems really fishy to me that there's clearly "fragmented" pieces of bodies that come together to form the whole.</p>
<p>This is some serious MK Ultra level shit, my friends. </p></p>

<p><p>Does anyone actually take him seriously?  He's a joke.  Attaching anything to him is a good way to sink it.</p>
<p>Celebrities in general are bad spokespeople, partly because there's no requirement for intelligence, critical thought, or education to become one, and because so many have their heads up their asses.  </p>
<p>If you want credibility, and if you actually want justice, find someone with an education and a reputation for fairness and bravery.</p></p>

<p><p>don't know why you're getting downvoted. I agree, public perception of kanye is pretty low among people who aren't his fans. Loads of people think hes an idiot and crazy. The perfect spokesman to detract credibility from this, indeed.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah, I really don't even trust myself but just found his recent activity to be... Interesting? He's put himself in a very strange light it could possibly something that could be used to our advantage to spread info. Since I posted this I have seen posters come here from links that were shared on Facebook, didn't expect that. There are probably better avenues to take than Kanye but just wanted to put the idea out there for criticism.</p></p>

<p><p>Whoa there, buddy. I don't know who you are, what you posted, or what you asked for. I am not responsible for your thread getting deleted. I'm not asking for his help, I'm asking for opinions on if it's a plausible avenue to take. The more I've thought about it the more I am leaning towards "no". Didn't think this thread would get so much attention but I'm about to delete it becuase I'm tired of getting these messages and having to explain myself over and over.</p></p>
