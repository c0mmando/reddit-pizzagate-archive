<p><p>If you're deleting stuff, I really hope your privately archiving too else you could be destroying evidence which could hold ever worse crimes.</p>
<p>Pople have posted WHOIS with the guy's name clearly listed. Exactly the same name at that on the orphanage's About/Team section. And clearly with links and picture to Clinton! AND his name is on WikiLeaks. What more do you want!!!?</p></p>

<p><p>How do you think any investigation starts!? We're in the PROCESS of collecting information!</p>
<p>I think we need a private member's section tbh. This just isn't organized AT ALL. I'm not sure working on this stuff publicly is the best way forward. We need a wikileaks style of investigation. Trusted people can work together privately and then once we have hard evidence, it can be shared out more publically. Obviously we don't want to stop people investigating, but we're running a very close race here against these evil forces.</p>
<p>I guarantee we have the highest of the high in politics/government/NGO's swarming over all this as we speak.</p>
<p>It only does more to reassure we're onto something.</p>
<p>We need Wikileaks' help. I'm pretty sure they are on this. Julian - help us!!</p></p>

<p><p>The only information that has been collected: DC businesses and politics are deeply entwined. Absolutely. Do you know how many fundraisers for different politicians there are in DC every year? Do you know how important it is for a business in Washington DC to cozy up to a political party for fundraising? Alefantis is connected to the establishment and he uses those connections to host fundraisers at his restaurant, I would imagine because it is incredibly lucrative.</p>
<p>Also, most of the posters on this sub don't have any familiarity with modern art or the hipster aesthetic at all, or how to run a successful, slightly more eccentric social media campaign.</p>
<p>Much is made of the bands that have performed at comet, and the art for the posters. Look up any hipster rock venue across America and you will see a similar aesthetic. Are they all working for the global elite and a part of the pedophile ring? How would that be humanly possible.</p>
<p>Much is also made of the "kill room" pictured on the jimmycomet Instagram account, how a walk-in for a pizza place would never be that size. Well, how about a walk in for both the pizza restaurant and Bucks hunting and fishing, the restaurant next door that he also owns. Ditto for all the "tunnels" being duh that supposedly link to a sort of Shanghai tunnel complex running under DC.  Dude is using his space to more efficiently operate two restaurants next to each other.
<a href="http://www.metroweekly.com/2015/04/from-scratch-james-alefantis/">See: </a></p>
<p>Also, in the linked article, Alefantis mentions that his brother has a young child. Could this possibly be the child in all the "sinister" Instagram pictures, who some posters think is Madeleine McCann?</p>
<p>Again, there is nothing here that can be substantiated. There is a risk of this sun being shut down but that is due to the fact that people are starting to witch hunt and doxx innocent people with no proof of any involvement with any sort of pedophilic behavior.</p>
<p>Edit: Banned. Oh well. Have fun finding pedophiles under every rock.</p></p>

<p><p>We need to keep our wits about us. You have to understand the difficult position that mods are facing. On the one hand, we need to compile as much evidence as possible and expose the people and groups involved. On the other hand, posting too much personal information can get this sub shut down. I think some posts/comments are being deleted because the actual individuals being identified have threatened legal action</p></p>

<p><p>I agree, but it's too late. The cat is already out of the bag, and the public disclosures will continue regardless. However, we also have to remember that different agencies are almost guaranteed to have significant evidence of these abuses occurring, yet they allow it to continue. Perhaps significant public exposure is the only hope we have.</p></p>

<p><p>Yes, I just hope we may have helped them in some way. I hope we've not hindered, that's the only danger. Someone needs to create a startup for these types of investigations. Public forums can be great, but not for something this high profile. It doesn't get any higher that this. I can possibly even have connections with royalty (Prince Andrew has always been on the radar over Lolita Island for example).</p></p>

<p><p>This is 1984 in action folks. This is why the NSA are so keen to censor the internet. THIS is what they knew about.</p>
<p>I wouldn't be suprised if there is a false-flag cyber attach coming up VERY soon. It's fucking scary. These people have too much to lose but too much power to save them. They will no go down without a fight. And boy will they fight.</p>
<p>What started off as a few silly mentions of Pizza has turned into something dark. Darker than anything anyone can even imagine. What have we unleashed?</p></p>

<p><p>There's definitely a campaign to counter the aim of this sub. Proof that you're on the right track.</p>
<p>On the other hand this is a witch hunt and there are likely to be innocent people picked up as false positives. Evidence gathering is what needs to be prioritized.</p></p>

<p><p>Don't you think someone in charge of an orphanage a few miles away from this place would be desperate to HELP us. But instead he's trying to get it all taken done. SMOKING GUN AGAIN? And the fact Best Pasta were the FIRST to change their Logo. All a little fishy if you ask me. His actions will make us all the more diligent.</p></p>

<p><p>It's good he says he's contacted the FBI. Other members have also contacted them. They will ultimately need to make the direct connection, as keyboards only get us so far.</p>
<p>I pray the orphanage has NOTHING to do with this. I really do. No one was directly saying they were doing anything wrong, but we were in the middle of making connections. We DO know the man's name matches though. And we DO know the orphanage was awarded a prize from Clinton Foundation in 2015. We also DO know that Besta Pizza and the Orphanage WHOIS address are only minutes away. This things are FACTS.</p></p>
