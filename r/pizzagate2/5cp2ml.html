<strong>So I found somethings by looking into the creator of the Dr pingpong website, but not sure if I should post it all</strong>
<p><p>Decided to post it and report it to authorities. </p>
<p>Part 1 The creator of pipto.com is lassejensen.gmail.com found his email in this seemingly secret conversation with others: http://archive.is/3Q2D4#selection-2007.45-2185.4 I also found this http://domainbigdata.com/nj/DlYRmhB0q1wurK-AV2S1cQ that shows all the domain names that are registered to lasse jensen. One of the website's spiked my intrest was called bestsexprice.com which is apparently offline.</p>
<p>Part 2 I typed in "bestsexprice" into google and the first thing that popped up was an interesting site called flagsworld.ru/directorycfo which link you to directorycfo.com as well as other possible websites. -These websites seem to be a market place of sorts.. links to this guys twitter- https://twitter.com/PeteGouldSocial?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</p>
<p>Part 3 - Forgot how I came to this, but its the most disturbing so far. http://successfulmarketing4u.blogspot.com/ and it is how I reached this website: http://archive.is/wYDPS -look at "Family Vacation are Fun" shit even the creepy fucking van too... but that directed me to this other website for child prostitution in vietnam (I believe). http://archive.is/LXzVn why does it make you choose child as infant or children, and the price only changes when you add a child/infant to your cruise but doesnt change with another adult. http://imgur.com/a/rjRkz</p>
<p>Part 4 Using http://spyonweb.com/jkdstreetdefense.com I went to adatravel.net, which is in the same IP address as jkd website which sends you to the vietnam cruise. I found a document on google that had the adatravel email address, hwallace@adatravel.net. Finally this lead me to http://www.universal-spanish.com/children.html which I believe to be the similar to the vietnam cruise but for mexico. To try to further prove my theory I looked up the universal-spanish address on google maps. Right next door to the business there was a sign with a heart and a baby in the middle of it. Picture of the sign: http://imgur.com/a/AFr4a https://www.google.com/maps/@18.9212806,-99.2415729,3a,66.6y,237.94h,75.4t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1snng2HV57PQsDjT6VK8bhug!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1</p>
<p>OH and fucking Ping pong !!!!! http://www.universal-spanish.com/activities.html</p></p>

and it is how I reached this website: http://archive.is/wYDPS
-look at "Family Vacation are Fun" shit even the creepy fucking van too...
but that directed me to this other website for child prostitution in vietnam (I believe).

<p><p>Should have recorded how I came to certain websites with more detail, but I have another website that is whois protected and not sure if it links to anything. http://instabucksmailz.com/blog/tag/sugarmailz-com/</p>

It's from succesfulmarketing4u website. </p></p>

<p><p>Playing the Devil's advocate here, but...</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Looks like very typical online affiliate ad spam crap to me.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Automatically spun content reads like shit like that. You can see that the URL's dropped in there match the keywords of the site behind the URL. This was (and I guess to some degree still is) <em>the</em> main search engine optimization method years ago, and people used so-called satellite blogs with this type of content that was only aimed to look legitimate for search engines in order to get the sites they link to rank higher.</p>
<p>I can't see anything "out of the ordinary" here either.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>If you'd had ever travelled, you'd know that dividing children into infants and "regular" kids is a very normal thing, as it all comes down to pricing. Typically kids under two are "classified" as infants and as such they could be allowed onboard even for free, whereas kids up to, say, 15, are e.g., half the price of an adult.</p>
<p>As to why a pricing script of a website is not working correctly on an archived page (or even the original page for that matter), proves absolutely nothing. Such issues happen even on updated sites every now and then.</p>
<p>Unless your post is deliberately misleading, you're just looking too much into it.</p></p>

<p><p>Okay the JKDSTREETDEFENSE.COM and http://sugarmailz.com/?rid=6 uses "WHOISGUARD PROTECTED" which throws redflags immediately. I would believe that if it weren't a series coincidences like having a pedo van, creepy talking under the family vacation are fun. I mean, " That is why all-inclusive circle of relatives vacations are the satisfactory manner to take your dream experience." The part about 'all-inclusive circle' with the given context of pedophile circles seems to much, but hey maybe I am looking into it too much. There is however too much of a coincidence that each child adds $150-200 to the total while adults do not add anything. I tried it in multiple scenarios and all of them have the identical "bug." </p>

<p><p>I make an extra $9 whenever I add it. That's why I do. Also I would guess most people buying a domain for the first time wouldn't know to remove it from their cart. On namecheap and godaddy I think it's in there by default. I'd be curious what percentage of domains have it.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm starting to think we got some CTR on here now. This website has zero ads on it, whoisprotected, and links to a website that is most likely used to book a perfect pedo trip.</p></p>

<p><blockquote>
<p>This website has zero ads on it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SugarMailz is one of the dead "get paid to read email" type of craps that were popular in the 90's. Essentially you'd log in and read "email" in the system on the site, and get paid for that. There isn't supposed to be any banner ads <em>on</em> the site.</p>
<p>The other one is also not meant for <em>banner</em> advertising, and it's (most likely) just a part of larger blog network that were used in to push "link juice" to the domains they link to, in order to make those sites rank higher on search engines. Once again, <em>they're</em> not the sites the advertising happens on. Everything here looks very usual to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>whoisprotected</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like another user said, not only is WHOISGuard typically either included on the price of the domain, or very cheap, but in itself there is nothing overly shady about the use of it. While it's something that is in many cases used by those who have something to hide, it's also an easy way to just make your public information private. Something a private person might appreciate, as you're required by ICANN to keep that information up-to-date and legit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and links to a website that is most likely used to book a perfect pedo trip.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like I wrote in my previous message, I really think that you're just looking way too deep into this. The content reads weirdly because it has been (re)written by a machine that replaces nouns and adjectives, thus it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to imagine that the original article contained the word "group", which the program changed to "circle" in order to make the article seem more unique than the original one.</p>
<p>Also I still don't get where are you pulling these prices from? The snapshot obviously doesn't have the script working on it, and using the live version of the site seems to give pretty valid prices to me, and changing the combination of people doesn't give any unexpected prices to me.</p></p>

<p><p>How does the pricing seem normal to you? Why does the price only change when you add a children? What is the probability of having a website with a pedo van linking to a website for curises in vietnam that has a faulty script not working for adjusting prices on just adults and not children? Also, what do you think about the mexico trip website and the business next door on google maps? It just seems like the probability for all of this to occur is extremely low. </p></p>

<p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>One room (max. 2 people), one adult, no children = $125<br/>
One room (max. 2 people), two adults, no children = $190<br/>
One room (max. 2 people), one adult, one child (4-12) = $125<br/>
One room (max. 2 people), one adult, one child (0-4) = $125<br/>
One room (max. 2 people), two adults, one child (4-12) = $200<br/>
One room (max. 3 people), two adults, one child (4-12) = $285<br/>
One room (max. 3 people), three adults, no children = $285  </p>
<p>So yeah, they pretty much do seem normal to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does the price only change when you add a children?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't. If anything it doesn't change when changing the age of the kids.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the probability of having a website with a pedo van linking to a website for curises in vietnam that has a faulty script not working for adjusting prices on just adults and not children?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we take into account how you're just pulling these accusations like "pedo van" out of your ass, probably around the same as AVIS being the transport network of a pedo ring because they rent out vans and have a photo of kid looking away from the camera on their front page (clear sign of turning away from evil).</p>
<p>Just because you refuse to believe that the sole purpose of weirdly reading blogs like that to even exist is to make the site they point to rank higher in search results doesn't make it any less true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, what do you think about the mexico trip website and the business next door on google maps?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just think that you're really starting to see things where there probably aren't any. Hope you don't run across the old GB Glace logo... Really, I couldn't go two blocks to any direction where I live without running into pictures of kids and hearts, and if I started to draw conclusions like that I'd probably see pedophilia rings literally everywhere around me too.</p></p>

<p><p>Adults should add to the price. I understand that infants can be free for travel while 3 &amp; up ect. are charged, but adult tickets should definitely be full-priced. I agree, this is suspicious.</p></p>

<p><p>Check the Javascript of the website and see if they have a Google AdSense tracking tag or Google traffic tracking tag.  If they do and if they are connected to the same account you'll have more evidence.</p>
<p>edit: for that matter they might have alexa tracking tags or a whole slew of other tracking options in there.</p></p>

<p><p>Using http://spyonweb.com/jkdstreetdefense.com
I went to adatravel.net, which is in the same IP address as jkd website which sends you to the vietnam cruise. I found a document on google that had the adatravel email address, hwallace@adatravel.net. </p>
<p>Finally this lead me to http://www.universal-spanish.com/children.html which I believe to be the similar to the vietnam cruise but for mexico. To try to further prove my theory I looked up the universal-spanish address on google maps. Right next door to the business there was a sign with a heart and a baby in the middle of it. https://www.google.com/maps/@18.9212806,-99.2415729,3a,66.6y,237.94h,75.4t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1snng2HV57PQsDjT6VK8bhug!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1</p>
<p>Am I crazy?</p></p>
