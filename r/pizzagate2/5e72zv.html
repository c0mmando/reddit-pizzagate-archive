<strong>On The Legitimacy Of This Investigation (with an important message to fellow journalists I know are lurking on this sub)</strong>
<p><p><strong>Edit: this is a throw-away account, I will not be using it further nor answering any questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Edit2: impossible to get such a piece passed my editor, so I'm leaving it here for people to distribute (send it to journos if you have the emails, it will silently resonate)</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>We are told the work on /r/Pizzagate (and other message boards) is illegitimate because people are rushing to conclusions, or because they are being paranoid, or partisan (despite so many of different political complexions provably working together). The subtitle here of course is that the State is solely legitimate to suspect and investigate crimes.</p>
<p>But what if the State itself is, in a systemic way, responsible for said crimes? It wouldn't be a first; after all, democide (death by government, a word surprisingly absent from conversations) <a href="https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM">was the first cause</a> of non-natural deaths in the 20th century. Whether one is from the right, left, or center, one cannot deny government is the number one abuser, enslaver and serial-killer in History. We may honestly disagree on the ways to eradicate the phenomenon, or we may regret that fact, but we cannot deny it.</p>
<p>So, if the State itself is committing crimes, it is the people's sovereign and sacred duty to expose it. Those who understand this truth best tend to become journalists. At least, that's what drove me to the profession.</p>
<p>Now specifically on this work. First, there is context; institutional child abuse is already a <a href="http://pastebin.com/Jn2LfXg4">common-knowledge</a> phenomenon. From the Presidio affair to Jimmy Saville and the BBC, or from the Vatican's historic involvement in covering-up pedophilia to US legislators' documented trips on the "Lolita Express", from the questions still surrounding Dutroux to the Hampstead doubts, the scourge has been featured in the news, movies, documentaries, art work. There have also been many policymakers, prosecutors, investigators and victims denouncing the very phenomenon; see for example British MP John Mann <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8QV2dn3gMQ">passionate speech</a> before Parliament on the subject last year, or the <a href="http://www.childtrafficking.org/cgi-bin/ct/main.sql?file=view_document.sql&amp;FULL_DETAIL=Yes&amp;ID=1156">extensive report</a> by former undercover Interpol agent (Bannon). Indeed it is a secret de <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulcinella#Miscellanea">Polichinelle</a>. So the only possible disagreement can be on the scale and systemicity of the phenomenon. </p>
<p>To honestly decide whether that's what we are seeing in the Podesta emails, please have a look at <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736">this one example</a>. Look at the invitation at the end of the thread. Ms Luzzatto is inviting people (among which are John and Mary Podesta) to a farm in Lovettsville. This is what she says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so youâ€™ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Impossible, you say? They couldn't possibly be speaking about abusing the children! After all, what step-grandmother would offer three innocent children up for group abuse?</p>
<p>This is how invitee Drew Littman answers the invitation: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've never had an affair, so I pass the Walter Jones test.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you aren't aware, Walter B. Jones has for 20 years been the U.S. Representative for North Carolina's 3rd congressional district; in DC he's regarded as the absurd caricature of a do-gooder, i.e. he is a noble man indeed.</p>
<p>Agreed, if that example was the only one, one could dismiss it as baroque misinterpretation. But there's more, much more. Let's not even get into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief_code">handkerchiefs</a> and codewords - even though "cheese pizza" is a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cheese+pizza&amp;defid=5020199">known</a> euphemism for "child porn" (and there are abundant examples in the Podesta emails where that term is used in very strange and out-of-context manners).</p>
<p>How about the fact that John and Tony Podesta are old friends of Jeffery Epstein, Dennis Hastert and Clement Freud, three convicted child molesters? Who has so many child rapists as friends? Who <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48488">stays friends</a> with child rapists after they're exposed and convicted?</p>
<p>How about the Katy Grannan <a href="https://archive.fo/vddrO">photos plastered</a> around the Podestas' mansion, depicting naked teenagers? </p>
<p>How about Tony Podesta writing he's <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/49348">"very good and a little wired"</a> from being seated next to "the kids" on an airplane?</p>
<p>How about the underground vault on the Podestas' property which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2004/apr/20/usa.world">admittedly</a> allows them to watch "very complicated video pieces"?</p>
<p>If you are feeling ill-at-ease, that reaction is honorable. And the worse thing is you haven't yet seen much. But for more, you'll have to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pizzagate+summary+site:reddit.com">look</a> for it. Indeed one might be breaking statutory laws by linking to some of the clues Internet sleuths have found in the past three weeks.</p>
<p>For example, did you know James Alefantis, listed 49th "most influential" person in DC by GQ, chef and White House regular, boyfriend of David Brock, owner of Comet Ping Pong, had an Instagram account filled with references to and depictions of child abuse and torture? Indeed it's not just the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GOluiqWYHU">frescoes</a> in his restaurant or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlhBn_zSIro">"artists"</a> he hosts there; it's not even the fact his menu and the logos of three other iconic businesses next door feature <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/FBI_pedophile_symbols">FBI-recognized</a> pedophilia symbols. No, this is about his own posts, pictures, comments and friends on social media. Again, you'll have to <a href="https://www.google.ch/search?q=alefantis+site:reddit.com">look it up</a> for yourself. It is hardly ambiguous. Indeed it is Alefantis who puts the pizza in #Pizzagate.</p>
<p>If that surprises you, did you know Arun Rao was caught "liking" several of Alefantis' creepiest toddler Instagram posts? Again, that could be dismissed - only there's all this context, and the fact Mr Rao is a Assistant US attorney, and charged with prosecuting child pornography and abuse.</p>
<p>And if you're still not distinguishing the pattern, did you know that Laura Silsby (Gayler), the woman <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case">caught</a> trying to <a href="http://archive.is/NdmLd">smuggle</a> thirty-three children out of Haiti (a country where the Clinton Foundation <a href="http://www.snopes.com/monica-petersen-killed/">isn't</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/06/13/did-the-clinton-foundation-raise-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-for-a-hospital-in-haiti-that-was-never-built/">without</a> <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/437883/hillarys-america-secret-history-democratic-party-dinesh-dsouza-clinton-foundation">controversy</a>), whose release from jail became a <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3465">personal</a> <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/25620#efmADVAEeAJCAL2AMfANj">matter</a> <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/2772">for</a> Ms Clinton, thereafter <a href="http://archive.is/xFplZ">became</a> an associate of MyStateUSA, which changed its name to AlertSense, and which is the one <a href="http://azbroadcasters.org/wp-content/uploads/AMBERAlertpressreleaseFINAL11-15-06.pdf">providing</a> the technology to issue Amber Alerts?</p>
<p>Enough already. If anything I have proven the legitimacy of the following question:</p>
<p><strong>Is there a systemic pedophilia problem in Washington DC, as we <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/05/30/the_dark_side_of_hollywood_the_secret_is_out_now_the_alleged_abuse_of_children_must_be_confronted_and_investigated/">already suspect</a> there is one in Hollywood?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of national systemicity, the statistics are eloquent. The <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150412061921/http://icmec.org:80/en_X1/icmec_publications/ICMEC_mech.pdf">International Centre for Missing Children</a> (ICMEC) estimates that 8 million children are reported missing each year around the world. Of that number, according to U.S. Department of Justice research, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151109150213/http://www.missingkids.com:80/KeyFacts">an estimated 800,000 children</a> will go missing in the United States alone â€” a rate of over 2'000 missing children each day â€” with <a href="https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/about-us/cjis/ncic/ncic-missing-person-and-unidentified-person-statistics-for-2014">466,949 of those cases</a> entered into the FBIâ€™s National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database in 2014. With a <a href="http://www.childstats.gov/americaschildren/tables/pop1.asp">current child population</a> (aged 0 â€“ 17) of around 74 million in the United States, the U.S. Department of Justice figures equate to around 1 child in every 92 going missing in the United States each year.</p>
<p>This looks like a systemic problem indeed. Childhood disappearances <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/282929.php#top_10_leading_causes_of_death_in_more_detail">outnumber</a> cancer deaths in the United States by one third. </p>
<p>Therefore, given the sheer amount of leaked emails, and the suspected phenomenon's scale and repartition, it is likely the data dumps (Podesta and other Wikileaks, Guccifer 1/2, DNCLeaks, etc.) provide some clue to the problem. Therefore, they should be investigated thoroughly under than particular lens, and suspicions need to be corroborated with other (and previously) known facts.</p>
<p>So, my fellow journalists, why aren't you all looking into this? Is it easy for you to dismiss it as confirmation bias?</p>
<p>I'm not going to answer the question for you. At least hop on the bandwagon: this is coming out with or without your help. But remember some moments are defining, in one's career, for one's conscience. </p>
<p>I'll conclude with two <a href="http://www.mediawise.org.uk/european-union/">excerpts</a> of the Munich Declaration of the Duties and Rights of Journalists (kind of our own Hippocratic Oath).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The responsibility of journalists vis-a-vis the public has precedence over any other responsibility, in particular towards their employers and the public power.</p>
<p>[A journalist's duties include] respecting the truth no matter what consequences it may bring about to him, ... defending the freedom of information, of commentaries and of criticism, [and] not suppressing essential information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>... and one question:</p>
<p>If this doesn't matter, what does?</p></p>

<p><p>Edit: I was permanently banned for posting Anthony Weiner and Bill Clinton's cell phone numbers and emails off of 8ch.net/pol (I can only let you guys know about ban via edits as I can't respond).</p>
<p>There will be a revolution. It is not about the pedophilia. This is a method of blackmail by which our politicians are controlled. They sell their souls to Soros, Rothschild, etc by giving them damning evidence of their crimes against humanity. In return, they wield the propaganda power of our media, the economic power of our banks and businesses, and the judicial power of our secret government. They must not diverge from the visions of their masters. It's no different than the Sinaloa cartel or the Italian mafia, it's just a global occurrence. The fathers of the Rothschilds and Soros's today are the same men whom Hitler tried to expel from Germany, and did in the 1930's. The only mistake he made was he lost. Most of our history on Nazi Germany was ~~written~~ <strong>(lets not discount hard work done by good historians)</strong> heavily influenced by the winners of WWII, these supermassive Jewish bankers and international business men. Look into it for yourselves. We live in a propaganda state. Keep in mind that I have no problem at all with regular Jews. <strong>I have a problem with about 30 people in this world.</strong> I have a problem with the bankers and highest businessmen who own our country, ~~who just happen to be Jewish~~ (15 to 30 people). </p>
<p>THE CREDENCE OF THIS INTERNATIONAL CLIQUE DOES NOT MATTER. WE CANNOT PERSECUTE JEWS. THAT WOULD BE THE SECOND BIGGEST  MISTAKE IN HUMAN HISTORY. THE LARGEST IS THE MISTAKE THAT HITLER MADE. MANY OF YOU DENY THE HOLOCAUST. IT IS A MOOT POINT. WE CANNOT EVEN INTERN JEWS. THEY NEED OUR LOVE MORE THAN EVER AT THIS JUNCTION. IF WE GAIN TRACTION THEY WILL TRY TO MAKE US ATTACK JEWS. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CONSPIRACY IS ONLY A HANDFUL STRONG. WE. WILL. END. THEM.</p>
<p>I like Bernie Sanders. I like affirmative action. I like nationalized health care. I'm liberal, not a neonazi. I respect those who disagree with me, as I feel the forces we are combating do not know political party lines. </p>
<p>With that said. We are united against this syndicate. If you are American. If you are British. If you are Canadian. If you are Turkish. If you are Indian. If you are Polish. If you are Russian. If you are Brazilian. If you are a citizen of this Earth. Fight. Fight for your bloodline and for your people and your land. We will not battle each other. History is going to stop repeating itself. We are going to overthrow this international clique. We don't need a one world government. We need a world free of hatred and the manipulation of countries against each other. The idea that the "other is evil" is a fiction created to distract us from a monolithic conspiracy raping our world. </p></p>

<p><p>That's exactly what they don't want to hear - it's not blacks vs whites, christians vs muslims, men vs women, straight vs gay, ... it's the people against the bankers and the State they control.</p>
<p>Divide and conquer, hegelian dialectic, disagreement through semantics, human domestication, that's what that hermetic cult of knowledge seeks.</p></p>

<p><p>They're compromised. Assange is on the Guantanamo Express. Please don't make me prove it to you. The dead man's keys are already out there with the keyholders trying to get the info out. There were massive ddos attacks on wikileaks and twitter to prevent a monolithic response. They doxxed the entire Clinton Foundation on 8ch.net/pol. Ask me if you have any questions. I'm like 90% sure on this one.</p></p>

<p><p>I think the PizzaGate stuff and some of the rest of this is the DMS. It's one of the few things disgusting enough to everyone outside the very few extremists who use it as power or signalling to make normal people hang everyone involved. Those who are legitimately perverts like that in the first place are the ones organizing this as well.</p>

<p><p>PM me. I read about it but if you can provide a detailed synopsis of what you know thatd be cool. (Assanges departure)</p>
<p>Also what about the deadmans keys? I heard the switch was compromised by the massive ddos attack.</p></p>

<p><p>There was a post in /r/conspiracy detailing the flight path the night his internet was cut, however, a post earlier this weekend detailed information on a cell phone and camera package was sent to him and it returned pics every 10 sec to a server. This implies that he was taken or killed even earlier than we thought. He wasn't there to have his internet cut. It was a ruse to hide the fact that he was already dealt with.</p></p>

<p><p>I remember they shipped a camera that took pictures every ten seconds a few years ago and he took pics holding up signs to tell everyone to remember various people and keep fighting.</p>
<p>Have people tried to re-send such a camera recently? What happened?</p></p>

<p><p>If you notice carefully, neither quotes mention Jewish. There is an argument to be made that it was Zionists. </p>
<p>I really don't want to invite a long discussion into the Hitler conspiracy because it's not one I can defend. But I respect its right to exist--disagreements should be fought with fact and discussion, not using labels to silence people. </p>
<p>You have a point that Pizzagate may not be the place for it, but 90% of what this person is saying has serious merit.</p></p>

<p><p>"zionists" is the pc way of saying "jews".</p>
<p>Hitler wasn't right in anything that he did regarding his expulsion campaign and the extermination camps. He needed a scapegoat, and since jews already kept apart, it was easy to single them out.</p>
<p>My point was just that this guy is a nut, and because of people like him the investigation loses legitimacey.</p></p>

<p>Not at all true. This is like saying Neocon is a pc way of saying Evangelical.</p>
<p>Judaism is a religion, plain and simple. Zionism is a political ideology.</p>
<p>I am not Jewish but I can be Zionist. I can also be Jewish but not a Zionist. I can be neither, and I can be both. </p></p>

<p><p>You're right, I was unclear. </p>
<p>Saying "I hate zionists" is the pc way of saying "I hate jews".</p>
<p>Zionism is literally just the belief that jews belong in Israel, it's nothing sinister. Saying something like "The zionists control the media" is just a prettied up version of the same crap your racist uncle would say, but for some reason it's cool to say.</p></p>

<p><p>As well as he did state that us regular Jews are not to be blamed, as well as there are quite a few of us that are sick of all of this. I have kids man. If anyone hurt my partner or even thought of doing the sick things they are doing to my kids they will have to kill me or I would kill them in a heartbeat. This is why we MUST look past labels and religious ideologies and all work together to get rid of these sick fucks.</p></p>

<p><p>I too agree with this, I mean honestly I was brought up in that there are good people and shitty people in all races, religions, orientations. As a Jew I'm not going to deny there are some really shitty asshole Jews (i.e. George Soros), as well as there are some amazing great Catholics and then asshole Catholic priests that molest and murder kids and people if you listen to anything that has been said about the Illuminati. People are just people and we are on the side to protect other human beings, whether that is women or kids, or gays or what have you, or we're one of the jerks that abuse these groups. </p></p>

<p><p>This, unfortunately. I would love to have someone refute that argument effectively. I've yet to see such an argument. Askhistorians did a decent refutation on the matter a while back, but even then, unless you research yourself, you're just regurgitating others' opinions. </p>
<p>Silencing any questions about the history behind Nazi Germany is probably the biggest reason people become alarmed at "facts" they'd never heard before. It prompts one to consider the adage, "To find out who rules over you, simply find out who you can't question." There is little doubt of how powerful the victim status is of Jews in general, let alone a global banking elite. If I were a part of such a dynasty, I couldn't conceive of a better safeguard than critical immunity. </p>
<p>Again, this coming from someone whose best friend, and several other friends are Jewish. My offspring are biracial.  I assume such communication muzzles have been used to varying degrees before. But being accused of racism post-WWII, as a certain ethnicity, has become one of the most powerful subversions, historically, that I am aware of.</p></p>

<p>ok into it for yourselves. We live in a propaganda state. Keep in mind that I have no problem at all with regular Jews. I have a problem </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to make pizzagate legitimate you're going to have to take that "Hitler did nothing wrong" stuff out of here. Its irrelevant and false, not to mention just more salt on the wound of people who have grandparents that went through that shit. You're never going to convince me personally that a man that whined about Jews and orchestrated death camps and experiments is anything less than a piece of shit. Jews don't work together to convince themselves the holocaust happened, plenty of Jews receiving 0 reparations with only haunting memories to take from all of it can tell you word for word what truly went on.</p></p>

</blockquote>
<p>If Hitler was such a nice, open minded guy that was just trying to do good, why did he lead a party who actively wanted to eliminate all other parties and opposing views, then proceed to order the execution of millions of people who didn't agree with those views - men, women or children?</p>
<p>Isn't that a tad evil / indicative of a guy who is perhaps not someone to be holding up as some sort of hero / martyr?</p></p>

<p><p>I've been thinking the same thing all day.  You can't compare Nixon and Watergate with Podesta et al. and their rape, (ritual?) abuse, and possible murder of young children.  What is left of America's true journalists are on this site - surely one of you can craft a more fitting phrase.  The sooner you do that, the sooner the general public will begin to pay attention.  </p></p>

<p><p>Why are there people downvoting this? This is eloquently written and connects the evidence with common sense. It's also perfectly packaged to pass along to other journalists or people new to pizzagate. I recommend for other users to comment or bookmark this post so that you have easy access to it and can share it.</p>
<p>Edit to add: We should also use this whenever journalists try to write hit pieces on pizzagate. Don't call them names or demean them; just forward them this write-up and hope that it speaks to their conscience and journalistic integrity.</p></p>

<p><p>It's not censorship, it's just people who think this is bullshit. I'm not one of them, myself (I'm undecided), but there are a lot of them, and it's very important to acknowledge them. Assuming everyone who disagrees must be "in on it" is the kind of rhetoric that discredits the very interesting and valuable work being done here.  </p>

<p><p>It doesn't provide proof of anything, relies in too many "ifs", it looks like the usual conspiracy where "everyone is involved", politicians, police, journalists...
Also t_d is obviously biased (yes, I know that THE MEDIA IS BIASED, no need to remember me, but doesn't make t_d less biased), and it's where all of this story originated and where many users around here are active users. Also they have a pretty extense record of pulling any kind of bullshit that will make THE LIBERALS look bad.</p>
<p>All and all, this looks too much like the usual conspiracy theory, which I usually don't believe. There are some details that support the tale, but not enough for it to be believeable to me.</p></p>

<p><p>Well, I understand why there are downvotes now. This thread has obviously spread outside of this sub, so it makes sense that there's a larger array of differing opinions. But I made my reply just a few minutes after the OP posted this thread, so I was curious as to why people were just hanging out in "New" at pizzagate and downvoting things without reading them.</p></p>

<p><p>Totally agree. What I've found to be a useful tool is to check the "detractors" post history. If all they've posted are detracting comments, probably a shill, but if they show a variety of interests, probably not. </p></p>

<p><p>Having followed this sort of accusation over many years and this sub specifically (and its peripherals since the Epstein case), I tend to agree. But it might be good fun to investigate the investigator and <em>really</em> go down the rabbit hole.  ;-)</p>
<p>I'm rather surprised the NYT piece didn't get more specific instead of just relying on innuendo, though. </p></p>

<p><p>If one reads the post superficially and without context (as the casual news junkie might), it just sounds like an extreme case of perverse confirmation bias. All of these citations, coincidences, and conclusions can be explained by pattern recognition, guilt by association, and perhaps the author's personal "issues".  </p>
<p>But then there is the mural shown at :38 in the referenced youTube link. </p>
<p>To all investigating this "fake news" story (implication per the NYT), it would be very helpful if at least a few of those millions of trafficked kids could be located and induced to bring positive indictment against the principals claimed here. (Surely <em>some</em> of them must have survived over the years, and surely a few of <em>those</em> must have gone on to live credible lives.) It would be a lot more convincing than <em>Hillary Clinton literally cannibalizes little children</em>. </p>
<p>More to the point, the <em>entire</em> FBI and international law enforcement community can't be complicit in a coverup; at least a <em>few</em> of them must be parents-- or former victims of child abuse themselves. </p>
<p>Now, if you could catch these people abusing cute, furry little house pets, the public might demand official investigation.  /s</p>

<p><p>I lived through The Lords of Bakersfield too - in a personal way.  Dana Butler lived two blocks down from me and across the street from my best friend.  I'll never forget the day I learned she had been found MURDERED.  That tends to leave a lasting mark on a kid.  I've no doubt there was ritual child abuse going on in Bakersfield then (maybe still?) But the theory now is that psychologists, arguably unintentionally, planted false memories in the children/victims.  So if any of the children are ever found - and if they are then willing to testify - great care must be taken in the way they are counseled so that the defense can't say that they were coached or that their memories were altered.</p></p>

<p><p>ArchonFall4All, I think that's a great approach. Like most people, journalists--myself being one, kinda--don't like hearing narratives incongruent to what they already believe. BUT, in most cases, the weight of truth will bring them to their senses. All of which is a long-winded way of saying that I believe your strategy--to bombard with evidence--will inevitably prove effective; not just with this story, but in general.  </p></p>

<p><p>I think the best place to start is the hotdogs from chicago emails and the pizza handkerchief emails, along with any other pizza/hot dog emails. </p>
<p>TO ME, the whole 'kids in the pool' one is less compelling, as children actually are entertaining. Though I admit that is strange, but it doesn't warrant an investigation on its own.</p></p>

<p><p>Because there is no actual evidence of anything and all it really shows is that the people propagating these claims are themselves obsessed with child abuse, or at least willing to manipulate the idea of child abuse for political reasons.</p></p>

<p><p>Thanks for sticky-ing this, mods. Let's get this shit to all.</p>
<p>Newcomers are going to find this info very difficult. The natural reaction is to dismiss, ignore, and leave. </p>
<p>I'm begging you all - look this beast in the eyes. These are the worst possible crimes. These are our kids. </p>
<p>Look the beast in the eye. There are so many more of us. There's power in numbers. We the people can judge this to be a sin against humankind, regardless of your religious views.</p>
<p>Look the beast in the eye. It will blink first.</p></p>

<p><p>I told a friend the short version of pizzagate and this, how the pols are controlled by being compromised.
People instinctively doubt this level of evil. But as this whole thing has fallen into place, I have followed. I read the podesta emails  when first leaked. The truth is horrifically stranger than any fiction.</p></p>

<p><p>Thank you for being centered enough to make that organized post. I was "doing ok" with Pizzagate until I saw the Twitter pages which made it so much more real. Any journalist who wants descriptions please feel free to scroll through my posts.</p>
<p>Emotionally...even though I have been subject to many of these same things...knowing how it feels...all I can feel now is despair. I'm ok...myself. You get better and it's just a story in your life...but to visually see children currently suffering, and in these instances I realize they are not going to be ok, that no one is coming for them, that no one loves them, that this is their life? I have no words for how this feels inside. This is real...as much as I wish it were not, it is, and I know the outcome for those young boys once they get too old...and I cannot think how to manage knowing that. </p>
<p>Those children may not be able to be saved, but by shining a light, by refusing to be silent, by telling this story, maybe other children can be saved.</p></p>

<p><p>I know how you feel... I want every person torturing these children to rot in solitary confinement for the rest of their lives. Screw them all. I'd devote myself to this if I could survive at the same time. I'd love to bring every pedo down in the dark web, Twitter, Hollywood, and Washington. </p>

<p><p>Twitter was bad enough...I don't even want to know about the dark web...I want to know where the guy who posted that filth on here claiming to have gotten it from the pizza computer...got that shit..and if any effort to turn his ass over to LE has been made.</p>
<p>If someone has that dark a heart to just post that shit...there is something literally not right in their head. </p></p>

<p><p>Had to choke back the tears reading your comment. I'm sure most, if not all, following pizzagate have had similar reflections. </p>
<p>I've had nightmares. I look at my nieces and nephews and feel overcome with relief that they aren't victims to the depravity that is unraveling before us. </p>
<p>Horror, disgust, sadness, and fear threaten us to inactivity and despair. We must Grieve for those who have fallen victim to these cruel oppressors and grieve also for those who still yet suffer. </p>
<p>If we are to take back the future that has been stolen from us, we must Keep the fires of indignation burning high and focus onward- that is our only hope, that is our only choice. </p></p>

<p><p>What is bothering me the most is I know what I saw...I know the Podesta stuff is real as well...people demanding a level of proof that is so illegal it makes one wonder what the agenda is...the Alex Jones pulling that fake ass shit...with the photo...there is enough truth here we don't need to fake anything.</p>
<p>Faking things takes away from the truth...his fake tears...hold nothing on the real ones I've been struggling with all day. Why do this?</p>
<p>We've had people coming here claiming to have evidence that posted such horrific things but their story was a lie...who does this? What possible agenda could someone have to do that? For the lulz? Seriously? They posted real child torture photos in an attempt to make the entire pizzagate thing seem invalid by claiming they got them from a pizza place computer...this is the shit that needs looking at. WHO HAS that shit readily available to post like that?</p>
<p>We're in deep trouble when we let the truth get lost in lies..it is a purposeful act to do that. They are as guilty as the others.</p>
<p>That makes me indignant...there were very valid questions after 9/11 and the truther stuff got lost in the insanity once the liars entered and started the "there were no planes" blah blah it made the whole idea of even questioning the official story seem insane...and they're doing it here too.</p>
<p>We must be vigilant and focused on truth.</p></p>

<p><p>Anything that picks up massive attention is likely to attract bad actors: paid dis-informants, attention-hungry individuals, those with personal self-interests that run tangential to the campaign/effort, ..</p>
<p>And let's not forget big brother who has at its disposal, the resources and many tricks to discredit movements such as pizzagate- installing instigators (like the DNC), suppressing/misrepresenting truth and spreading false information through moles and through MSM, etc.. </p>
<p>It's hard to wrap one's head around horrid practices and the system which maintains, propagates, and protects said practices. Such is the human condition. Absolute freedom goes both ways. </p></p>

<p>This is one heck of a video. One of the Dutroux victims recounted her story and I remember her mentioning them taking her to a pig farm. There was a British Columbia similar case involving high ranking pedophilia and cannibalism that was taking place on a pig farm also. When the Podesta email about the 3 young children being brought up for entertainment was leaked, I couldn't help but notice the place where it was taking place. Another isolated farm... Something else. Last week, there was a post on reddit about a BostonPizza foundation logo and page  https://twitter.com/BostonPizzaFdn
 When I the checked its montreal franchise twitter page, the first thing I saw was a post about a missing person and prayers going to this "Benjamin Cole Brown".
https://twitter.com/hashtag/benjamincole?src=hash
Here it is. The date is very important here. Just about a couple days after the Laura Silsby story came out on reddit, his plane crashes. http://www.theledger.com/news/20161018/plane-crash-kills-3-aid-workers-who-were-working-with-auburndale-man-in-haiti
Another 3 bodies... the count rises still.</p></p>

<p><p>This is the best and most persuasive/cogent write-up I've seen to attract mainstream belief in the possible revelations of Pizzagate. People, make some anonymous email accounts, copy and paste this post including the hyperlinked sources, and start sending them to newspaper tip lines or reporters in your city.</p>

<p><p>to cover this officially cannot be easy. i hope it will be done, though i am not one with the power to do so. i think my personal reaction to this must have been kind of typical in this day and age - and it is a problematic one. </p>
<p>in my country, there were good careers wasted in the ninetees when someone young said in a newspaper interview that swastika is a lovely symbol that is very positive in its original indian meaning - which is true but everyone went nuts when they heard swastika. boom, career over. in this context it seems especially sickening that a thing like pizzagate should pass unnoticed. but one also gets the feeling that all that can be done publicly is just to poke the tip of the iceberg. that the evil stuff will survive. my reaction to this is something along the lines - why the fck do you people still pay taxes, move to fcking panama city, i have. and that's indeed the problem. </p>
<p>i am convinced this will be eventully covered, but not without good damage control. which makes me sad.</p></p>

<p><p>Good post. The FBI and DOJ are complicit and negligent, and until they restore the rule of law and take serious action, it is up to the people to find the truth. How do we know they are complicit? There are many of us who have provided indisputable evidence of unspeakable levels of criminal corruption, and are still waiting for them to enforce the law. Tick tock... Will the law and our rights ever return? Will Julian Assange? </p>
<p>What happened to the discovery from yesterday, Sunday, November 21st about another pizza place? Why did it disappear so quickly and why did so many people call it a hoax or honeypot? Who would be so stupid to post something like that? Of course no one should post anything illegal, but if they were not lying, there could be much more to that. Same with Twitter issues from today - it sure is a coincidence that Twitter, Google, Facebook and others are hellbent on controlling the information. Add Reddit to that same team. Everything is fake news except for the truth, and the truth is being silenced. Where is Seth Rich? Ted Gunderson? Marc Turi? Eric Braverman? The list goes on and on. </p>
<p>This entire sub is infested with shills who are downvoting and covering up possible leads. Who would dismiss such accusations unless they are trying to cover it up? I do not trust the moderators here. Who would have a name pizza party with kids that cares about the truth? I have seen too many strange activity to dismiss things that may have validity. Reddit is becoming a swamp. Are the foxes guarding the hen house? It sure looks that way. </p>
<p>At this point we could trust Kanye more than our own government. At least his eyes are open. Trump has done the opposite of draining the swamp, and is throwing a life jacket to the Clintons and others involved while they take away our rights and our voice. </p>
<p>Pizzagate is real. Corruption is real. Complicity is real. Double standards are real. Is the law real?</p></p>

<p><p>I agree that Trump is still a bit an unknown, but pedo rings have no partisan lines. </p>
<p>What all of us are quickly realizing is that those in control foster pedophilia because they can better control the pedophiliac govt officials to do what they want. </p>
<p>It's like the mafia code of omerta, except instead of turning incriminating stuff to the police, they don't turn incriminating stuff over to public eyes. </p></p>

<p><p>according to the title page of spirit cooking, it is also an aphrodisiac, as complete control over someone, to rape or murder, is a thrill to these people.</p>
<p>Besides traumatizing victims into delusions, amnesic memories, or dog trained behavior, it also I suspect teaches them how to better manipulate others including adults.  Insight into cognitive dissonance and what people will ignore and forget, reactions, etc.</p>
<p>like dissecting frogs to learn, but it's children.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm so sick of hearing people believe it's "Marxism" or "Communism." </p>
<p>It's not any political ideology, but rather sick sociopaths who exploit whatever avenue they can to maintain power and control. </p>
<p>The fascists are the same, the communists are the same... to say it's left or right is missing the entire point.</p></p>

<p><p>They recruit people who are interested in sex with children, or caught. They offer them a choice, go to prison - or work for them. If they work for them, they get to indulge their perversions and get protected. The only drawback is, they are owned by the establishment, and must obey. They often perform acts on camera, often video, very sick stuff, like sex with children maybe even murder. These tapes are used for leverage, and blackmail. This is a very sick, but effective system. You get the loyalty of the pedophiles and total control of them. This rotten system is being held together by pedophilia. It is beyond sick. Just look at The Franklin Coverup, that stuff was going on in politics, media and law enforcement. So it never went anywhere. Same in the UK. </p></p>

<p><p>It's like the mafia, but it's the occult.  They are indistinguishable if you talk enough to many of them, as they will be typically involved in something like drug smuggling as well as their occultic practice.</p>
<p>Probably the most useful occultic practice to a criminal is anything like hypnotic amnesia (look it up) - getting your victim to forget what you did to them.</p>
<p>btw, the "thuggees" were a very similar wide spread murder cult in India, where we get the term thug from, that had over a million members at one time, all murdering victims.  look it up for an example of how wide spread a secret occult group can get.</p></p>

<p><p>Right, but you could legitimately argue that person was trying to help those children and bring them to a better life. It's basically what Angelina Jolie is doing with all her adopted kids. It's an admirable thing.</p></p>

<p><p>wait... back in early 2000s I hunted pedos on the net... if you ever came across anything the FIRST place you were to report it was NCMEC ... this is giving me the creeps I am having an xfiles moment. This means you turned over evidence to the leader of the criminal ring. FBI was the worst. They compromised multiple pedo investigations where pedos literally went free... my head is spinning</p></p>

<p><p>Great post, OP! Btw, if you want people to immediately see what you are referring to in the emails, there is a highlight button at the very bottom. You can select the words you want highlighted, and press "H" on the keyboard to highlight them. Then click the highlighter at the bottom of the page and click the permalink button. </p>

<p><p>I'd like to point out to anyone still reading these comments.  The FBI reports regarding pedophile euphemism's was made in 2007.  Now, I'm sure it was just the year of the publishing date and all.. but how insanely coincidental is it that the same symbol is clearly visible in this late 80's/90's home footage of a child drawing out her encounter with a man in a white robe standing about her.  Tell me what you see :(</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL7IisIqHxI ( Around the 1 min mark, but I suggest watching the entire vid.  Powerful stuff)</p>
<p>Late edit: Only cause I would want someone else to do the same, but after going back and re-watching, I believe the pedo symbol I had thought to be present in the footage looks that way cause of the old tech and crummy resolution.  Looks like it's actually another complete triangle in a complete circle like the child's first drawing @ the 1 min mark.  Doesn't take away from the heavy nature of the video though.</p></p>

<p><p>Just a question, where are the white hat hackers ? Isn't it a job for them ? I'm sure they know all of this shit, so why we don't heard anything about them ? It's a little bit more important than shutdown the psn or xbox I think ... for one time they can be really helpfull.</p></p>

<p><p>"white hat" means using commercial security tools only. "grey hat" means using both commercial and security community tools. Anybody who is serious is grey or black hat. What you need for this is someone who is willing to crack a few hundred servers and then submit everything via torrent.</p></p>

<p><p>I haven't updated my lingo in the last 6 years, but when I started going through my studies of TCP/IP and DNS that's what we used. Back in the days when AlephOne published landmark stuff. At the time, there was a lot of very expensive software that did almost nothing and a lot of meaningless certificates that merely demonstrated you could use the useless software. </p></p>

<p><p>Yes, and it's really good ofc, but have they stoped the work ? I don't think ... but why no communicate so ? Habitualy they do something like this, no ? </p>
<p>But, maybe it's better than what I think ... maybe they are working better than all of us and gather more stuff to send or make anything ... but it's a really really little hope. if not, I think I have no hope for all this shit come in real sanction IRL.</p></p>

<p><p>Trump was doing what all rich business guys do, which is network with anyone and everyone who could help perpetuate his deals. </p>
<p>For he himself to turn in Epstein, singlehandedly, would result in the whole system coming after him because of how deep that rabbit hole goes. </p>

<p><p>If it somehow would turn out that Trump is involved, which I've really seen nothing to show he was, he should go down as well.  There's no room for bias in a deal like this.  All involved should be outed and should go down like the Hindenburg.  I believe this overall story is true, and I also have no doubt that it will turn out that some (unnamed/unknown) asshole, who I previously liked, will be culpable as well.</p></p>

<p><p>I've seen images like that before, and I always assumed them to be elaborate fakes. Now that I know their true context, I'm so overwhelmingly sickened that I almost broke down. </p>
<p>We have to stay strong, all of us, and especially the ones who are putting their lives on the line to fight against this unspeakable inhumanity, this fucking evil. This is a crusade if there ever was one, and while I don't know if praying really works, I sure as hell am going to pray for some divine retribution to set this world straight.</p></p>

<p><p>I've been focusing a lot on these supposed code-words, and I still don't see how any of them could be assumed to mean anything. The quote you leave about the Luzzatto kids could easily be explained as some of the guests could bring their own kids, and they'd have someone to play with. To me the context and the rest of the conversation just doesn't make any sense to assume they're talking about pedophilia, even with other circumstantial evidence around it. What I'm trying to say is that these code words and hidden messages in the e-mails are complete dead ends imo, but I hope you can show me why I'm wrong.  </p>
<p>As someone who has a mild interest in art and several friends who are big into it, the artworks and the instagram posts don't strike me as suspicious either. I wouldn't be surprised to see my friends post similar things on IG, and I'd say the children in the IG posts are probably relatives or children of friends.  </p>
<p>The symbology talked about is also very far fetched. Even if I can concede that there is some semblance to the logos and symbology it just feels absolutely ridiculous that they'd advertise pedophilia like that if they were actually doing anything.  </p>
<p>The convicted pedophiles are the strongest selling points. However if the angle of pizzagate is not just pedophilia but satanic rituals I don't see the connection. The link from a few cases of pedophilia in washington to a huge occult conspiracy is missing.  </p>
<p>I'm very willing to discuss any and all points further, and I feel like meaningfull discussions are the best way to further these investigations because for every discussion you're forced to look into more and more evidence.</p></p>

<p><p>They never thought their emails would be subject to scrutiny by the public.  They believe(d) themselves to be above prosecution and that is what enabled them to talk in what is, in my opinion, a rather thinly-disguised code.  It's all a game to them.  Do you really believe that people as rich and powerful as they are would spend time sending these cute little messages to each other about how the fucking pasta sauce really tasted?   Here's a thought: have Podesta make that walnut pesto dish RIGHT NOW.  Think he knows how? That fucker orders out.  But he COULD come up with black male children to abuse.</p></p>

<p><p>Trying to google for it now is just about useless because of all the clickbait sites about pizzagate are covering the result page but I saved the link:<br/>
http://www.rodale.tv/video/john-podesta-can-cook<br/>
He doesn't look like an expert chef, but certainly like a guy who enjoys cooking and would like to present himself to the world as a guy who knows how to cook.  </p></p>

<p><p>No we can discuss the coded words as much as you like.<br/>
https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cr74l/pizzagate_link_compilation/<br/>
I have gone through the "Coded wikileaks communication" many times, I've searched for them and looked for context. I don't just read what others here write but I actually follow the links, read the full e-mail threads. It takes time but the more I read the less suspicious they get.  </p>
<p>So first of all, what are the sources for what these code words mean? We all know cheese pizza is a word used frequently on 4chan. But what about map = semen, or pasta = young girl? They're very specific and the only source which anyone can provide is an anonymous comment on 4chan. Did that commenter have specific insight into the inner circle? Was he whistleblowing on 4chan? Why did he provide so little information?  </p>
<p>What if I told you that Hamburger is codeword for beastiality, and the podesta leaks has 64 different e-mails talking about hamburgers. I'm sure we could find one e-mail where we can shoehorn my codeword theory in two out of 64 e-mails?
Do you follow my point here of the code words being retro-fitted?  </p>
<p>And last of all I'll provide you with an example which keeps getting reposted here: <br/>
https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html <br/>
Everyone has read that e-mail right? Has everyone read the rest of the conversation?<br/>

<p><p>This has more to do with the fact that there is a huge possibility that children are being trafficked through the Clinton Foundation's business dealings and the amount of paedophiles that are associated with the Clinton's, Podesta, Brock and cohorts is frightening. The supposed art is depicting child distress, torture, powerlessness and vulnerability to adults, complete domination. I'd suggest you take off your blinkers. Maybe the words don't always mean what is suggested and maybe sometimes they do. Your thoughts are fair analysis but you are trying to process something that is easier to explain away than to admit something's not right. Maybe we are off the mark with the emails but I will guarantee you that children are being kidnapped and raped within this group of powerful people.</p></p>

<p><p>There's no ONE piece of evidence that proves everything yet. You have to step back and look at the whole picture:</p>
<p>The obvious emails</p>
<p>The connections with <em>convicted</em> child molesters</p>
<p>The creepy Instagram pictures/comments</p>
<p>The pedo art at comet</p>
<h1>Twittergate and the connections there</h1>
<p>The shady Haiti dealings and deaths of people who have investigated the Clinton's</p>
<p>The podestas and their creepy "art"</p>
<p>The police sketches in Portugal</p>
<p>The odd occult symbolism everywhere, including in email attachments of people's grandkids holding upside-down stars and stuff</p>
<p>The accusations of people who said they were raped by politicians but no one listens to them because they're "crazy"</p>
<p>The lolita express</p>
<p>There's so much more. It's a rabbit hole but it's real. If you don't believe it yet fine, but it at least needs to be investigated. </p></p>

<p><p>Yes I see what you're saying. I think every lead should be thoroughly investigated. I'm currently focusing on the emails because that's where it started (the leaks together with code words) and they don't hold up. So I try to discuss it here but pointing out the flaws only gets me accusations of being a shill/troll. Check out my comment history in this board and see the replies (or lack of) I get to legitimate questions.</p>
<p>The instagram pictures and the art work is sketchy because of the emails and the emails are sketchy because of the artworks. To me that is circular reasoning.  </p>
<p>And again I'm not questioning the pedophilia, just the greater conspiracy of code word usage and satanic rituals, which to me has no backing except far fetched conclusions from highly circumstantial evidence. It's like the meme of drawing illuminati pyramid on top of triangles and makes the whole investigation seem like crazy people.</p></p>

<p><p>Honestly I agree with you that the satanic stuff is the hardest stuff to believe. And that's why a lot of redditors on this sub are reminding eachother not to focus on that part. </p>
<p>I also agree it's circumstantial. It's just A LOT of circumstantial evidence. That's why we're searching for more. </p></p>

<p><p>Yes it's a lot of circumstantial evidence but a lot of them are also somewhat contradictory or don't add up. And a lof o the circumstantial evidence touted as smoking guns doesn't hold up under scrutiny. And I keep getting vilified for scrutinizing, which is worrying to me.</p></p>

<p><p>Why would you pick that email instead of the pizza handkerchief one? https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795
In an investigation their's always dead leads, like the email you mentioned seems to be. Too many people involved in this investigation are trying to make it political and pretend it's only democrats involved and this was one of the supposed ties to Obama. While I believe wholeheartedly he's involved, you're correct, the email you produced proves nothing. Would you care to take a stab at the pizza handkerchief email, or would you rather that one not be mentioned? Did you know Kim Noble, a woman who claims to have been a victim of these monsters, drew a picture of herself being raped by someone with what appears to be a handkerchief under her to collect the evidence? http://www.kimnoble.com/Nowheretorun.jpg</p></p>

</p>
<p><p>Well first of all I'm talking about one e-mail at a time. I picked the one that is most easily dissected because I think the context I linked is very conclusive that it is in fact just talks about hot dogs however not everyone is as easily convinced as I am. Regardless of that, thank you for conceding that, I'm actually glad you brought up the handkerchief because I do want to talk about each and every one of the e-mails that are suspicious.  </p>
<p>Now before we talk about the handkerchief e-mail let me just adress Kim Noble. That poor woman who has suffered so much and still suffers from DID is being made into a circus by conspiracy theorists for years about MKUltra and project Monarch. Now I'm not going to go into those theories unless necessary, but lets adress the painting you linked. Yes it was drawn by Kim Noble but I have absolutely no clue what your source is for her claiming to have been abused by "these people", and I'm not accusing you because I have seen many others claim that the last week as well. The only thing I can find which is a decent first hand source (and not just random blogs claiming it from thin air) is an interview with her where she claims she has no memories of the abuse. She was supposedly under the age of ten when it happened, in the sixties. <br/>
http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/kim-noble-a-woman-divided-413223.html  </p>
<p>So with that in mind we have this one e-mail which everyone touts as a smoking gun. Let me first question the accuracy of the codeword key which is taken as truth here. It is claimed by one anon on 4chan, in a very short comment, after the leaks were done. Nowhere else on the googlable internet is map claimed to mean semen.</p>
<p>Lets ignore all that and just imagine it was covered in semen. Well if I was a realtor and found a handkerchief with semen on it I'd throw it away and act like nothing. But the realtor wants to impress them and give them back the semen covered handkerchief, she e-mails them about it, just saying it's black and white to keep it simple. When John then finds out that he left a semen covered handkerchief at the rental house, what does he say? "Don't worry about it".   </p>
<p>Or the alternative story: John had a handkerchief with a black and white map motif, maybe of the area his favourite pizzeria is in.  </p>
<p>Sorry for the wall of text but I wanted to adress all your points, though I'm sure I failed to do it thouroughly enough.</p></p>

<p><p>Your comment does absolutely nothing to discredit the mounds of data that has been accumulated until now. Even if the meanings of these code words are erronous... one can't deny the links between all these people, the computer generated images of those who resemble the podestas, the sick images and comments on IG accounts, the link to that cultist witch, numerous fund raisers in a place that have kids parties in the afternoon and punk rock shows with sexual themes at night, with paintings symbolizing canabalism in the basement, the ties to Jeffrey Epstein, the more you dig, the more it's obvious that something is being uncovered and it's my delight to announce to you that your kind is about to get their asses kicked. Your argument does nothing to deconstruct the evidence uncovered until now and the links that have been made, see the above article for proof. You're on your last moves.  CHECK MATE Motherfucker.</p>
<p>Edit: I spent several days digging through data, images, evidence of links between people and I can assure you that I've broken down on a few occasions. I've had 2 culture shocks in my life, this is one of them. If you can get past the emails and dig for a few days and not get a similar reaction or at least one of disgust, it means 1 of the following: 
1) You're one of them, or paid by them. 
2) Your level of intellect or depth of perception is simply too low/shallow to allow you to connect the dots, or you simply have very poor investigation skills. 
3) You have no heart.
4) Yourself have been sexually molested and your brain has developed a defence mechanism against it.
5) You're one sick fuck...</p></p>

<p><p>So you keep resorting to name calling instead of actually responding to my argument.  </p>
<p>Please at least comment on the hot dog fridays (last part of my previous comment) and tell me wether you think it's code word usage or just normal office talk. Because so far no one in this sub has commented that they still think it's code word after I post the rest of the email chain.   </p>
<p>Actual questions I'd love to hear your thoughts on (not trying to be a dick here) <br/>
1. How come I'm the only one who found the rest of the email chain if I'm too dumb or not researching enough? <br/>
2. Why is the hot dog Friday email still used as an example of code word usage?<br/>
3. Do you believe it's (that specific example) code word usage?   </p>

<p>The cost of 65,000 USD in hot dogs? Ok I done some snooping around and looked at this one famous Hot Dog eatery Portillos. Looked pretty good and pricey so I clicked on this one via TripAdvisor. You can get a 50 hot dog party pack for 172.95. That also includes the cost of shipping it to anywhere in the country so that is covered. Let's just say for arguments sake that Obama was feeling generous one day and decided to get oh idk, 2000 hot dogs to feed everybody in the entire White House and probably half of Capital Hill. That is 40 packs at 172.95, that still is only 6918 dollars. Far less than 65 grand. Big difference in prices so unless he is getting those "hot dogs" made by Mike Ditka and Jeff Mauro themselves with wagyu and kobe beef with flipping buns that are wrapped in gold leaf, 65 grand is way too much money for just "hot dogs". </p>
</li>
<li>Heck yeah, you better believe that this is code word usage. I mean I don't know why you guys call your dicks names but hot dogs are not very big, unless you go to Sonics and get a foot long hot dog, but most of the time they aren't very big and why would he spend 65k on hot dogs? It has to be coded. Another thing about that email was the fact that waitresses were in quotation marks. There are too many holes in just that one email alone. Combine that with other emails, a whole lot of things just don't make sense. </li>

<p><p>Did you read the rest of the email chain I linked? You still didn't comment on it, and you didn't answer any of my questions.   </p>
<p>The $65.000 is obviously a joke when you read the rest of the emails regarding hot dog Friday's. It's a sarcastic <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/4/21/11451378/smug-american-liberalism">smug liberal</a> making fun of "Obama is a Muslim"-type of headlines. It's hard to explain the joke but it is way less far fetched than them having young boys visiting the office which they can all rape in the break room every Friday.  </p>
<p>Like even if we assume there was something which cost $65,000 was he asking his boss to spend that amount also? Of course not irregardless the 65,000 is a sum which is irrelevant for their plans. This weaponized autism is really ineffective for discerning normies office banter....</p></p>

<p><p>Dig deep... The Hawaii connection. https://sli.mg/a/hhe7CP (scroll down to see stuff related to one of your hot dog emails). Listen to this for a clear explanation of the above link, starting at 23:40. https://youtu.be/FlFfJz_xrCQ?t=1426 Take some time to digest, then comment. Thanks.
All ties into hot dogs and hot dog stand in Hawaii, so not off topic of code words. Don't come back in an hour with comments, you'll need more time than that to investigate because there's too much to this story. Lookup the Dave Flinstone connection, party planners were contacting this guy for "sleep partners" and was also selling used hard drives that were way overpriced. If you can't see this, you have a serious problem and it will prove that you're a shill. Once you're done investigating that, look at this stuff: https://aceloewgold.com/2016/11/20/pizzagate-clinton-podesta-what-is-it-and-is-it-credible/. It speaks of the chilling emails that use the handkerchief code words. You're delusional if you can't see that there's something messed up going on. Have fun deconstructing that info. Check mate. Edit: Hawaii and hot dog connection also covered here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi6ryNOg8z0</p></p>

<p><p>If you can't handle legitimate criticism of arguments, you might as well not have any. Put on your skepticism goggles for a moment and try again. "you're lying" is a weak and cowardly rebuttal and just reinforces this sub's image as an echo chamber that takes part in the very censorship it complains about. </p></p>

<p><p>If you're always only looking for one thing it's easy to fall into pits of confirmation bias and group think. I'm really trying to follow the theories and digging deep, but also trying to apply Occam's razor and question everything. And the email/code word theory doesn't add up. Please do me a favor and just for 5 minutes consider that I might be an honest, normal guy who is on to something, and read what I have said in my other comments without bias, and I will continue doing the same for you.  </p>
<p>The more time I spend in this sub the more cult like it feels. Especially when anyone who asks reasonable questions only gets accusations of being shill/troll/liar. And that makes me even more skeptical because any healthy movement should do introspection.</p></p>

<p><p>A skeptic is one who requires sufficient evidence for claims. When evidence is questioned, a skeptic does not fall immediately to weak accusations of lying. Yelling "CTR" is both hilariously pathetic and is just not good enough. </p></p>

<p><p>Can I point out the missing children number is being misunderstood - that number is largely inflated by runaways who are found very soon after, but still counted in the missing children total.  I believe the real value of children never found again is 24,000 a year.  Still way too much, of course, but nothing like the near-million you have made out. </p>
<p>I don't want people to dismiss our legitimate investigation here because of a minor error like that, and that oversight alone makes me question you being a journalist.</p></p>

<p><p>Thank you for posting this.  You are clearly a person of the highest journalistic integrity.  I can tell the verbiage used in this post that you are a serious journalist, someone who works for a major news outlet like The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, the NYT or some other outfit.  The facts you mentioned above, coupled with the call to action to your fellow journalists, who are likely afraid to say the very words you said here, give me hope.  It shows me that the mainstream corporate media will be forced to report on this story very soon.  I hope it is you who leads the charge, and emboldens your fellow colleagues to print the truth no matter what the risk.  </p>
<p>Thank you for joining us.  You are a brother/sister at arms here!  We welcome a noble 'knight' like yourself on our side of the battlefield.  </p></p>

<p><p>This is the greatest investigative story of our generation. The information is literally out in the open for everyone to see. </p>
<p>But where are the journalists? They are no one to be found.</p>
<p>Innocent children are being molested, but our spineless, gelatinous journos are MIA.</p>
<p>When this comes out, think what that will mean for the profession of journalism.</p></p>

<p><p>Molested is putting it lightly, I think. These kids are being systemically kidnapped from foreign countries, raped, tortured, mutilated and ultimately killed. If all that's coming to light is actually true, the fallout could shake the entire power structure of the planet. </p>
<p>Thinking of the implications of this has been literally making me sick to my stomach and I can't sleep through the night anymore. This is beyond crazy. </p></p>

<p><blockquote>
<p>equate to around 1 child in every 92 going missing in the United States each year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is the 1 in 92 children go missing every year in the USA figure correct? That seems incredible. That would be one kid from your school year, every year. By the end of school, 12 or more of your school mates would have 'disappeared'. I can't (hope) believe that is correct.</p>
<p>EDIT : Looking at the stats briefly because I don't have time right now, I believe the problem is that the 1:92 are children who go missing, the vast majority of whom turn up later and their 'disappearance' was for innocuous reasons.</p></p>

<p><p>The biggest problem this sub has is that the mods can't be heavy handed when they should be able to. Because of the sensitive nature of the topic. If they delete a post of someone trolling us like yesterday, then have the morons start screaming that the mods are compromised and/shills. Meanwhile you're getting trolled or at worst honeypot. </p></p>

<p><p>So what if they are either/or? Regular Joe citizens were the ones that blew open the entire Arab Spring on Social Media and letting people know what was going on. Any and all of us are no different. When this does come full circle, all of the peoples user names that found the smoking gun to put these people go away will become infamous. Which side do you want to be on? </p></p>

<p><p>What's cool about this post is it's all in questions so even a drunk fuck like me can reply to any paragraph with "no, you're just an idiot". You even made it super easy to deny by only linking sources in the most grasped at straws and not anything that might prove genuine evidence. </p>
<p>Take your antisocial heads out of your antisocial asses and take yourself to comet ping pong. It's a pizza restaurant that has concerts sometime, and in the world of normal people that's not a big deal.  What's the point in harassing a local business owner anyway when trump already won anyway? </p></p>

<p><p>Your compilation is absolutely appreciated!
Here is what I recently found - reported by USDefenseWatch, politicalinsider and here on another threat:
The publishing of the Podesta email by WikiLeaks and spiritual cooking opened the door to another report from the abduction of a young child in Haiti while the Clintons were active there after the earthquake. While the parents of that missing child were able to stop the transport out of the country by these Clinton foundation individuals - an investigator - Monica Peterson - working on the investigation of the trafficking involving the Clinton Foundation was found dead. She worked for the Human Trafficking Center and travelled to Haiti to investigate the abduction of this young child connected with the Clinton foundation.
I would warn all those who are investigating this 'black and big taboo' to be careful. Murder is not out of the question for these evil monsters. Please stay safe!!</p></p>

<p><p>People who thinks this is impossible are either too young or non-european, and therefore can't remember the Dutroux affair (a pedophiliac ring involving high ranking judges in Belgium and all over europe) and the affair of the Angers pedophile, with 66 people involved in provincial notability in a pedophilic ring (without ever mentionning the disapeared of Iseres, and the political ramifications of it)</p>
<p>Why would you believe it is impossible for something that has happened on numerous occasions to actually happen again?</p></p>

<p><p>Horrifying stat...</p>
<p>"The International Centre for Missing Children (ICMEC) estimates that 8 million children are reported missing each year around the world. Of that number, according to U.S. Department of Justice research, an estimated 800,000 children will go missing in the United States alone â€” a rate of over 2'000 missing children each day..."</p>
<p>Great post btw. We need more journalists investigating this.</p></p>

<p><p>I saw this news article recently, and one line jumped out. </p>
<p>"However, Animal Services noted that there were a number of enclosures, believed to house animals, that they could not gain access to."</p>
<p>I guess there was some illegal boarding for horses and dumping of trash going on with this property. </p>
<p>Struck me as odd they are just now closing it down bc I saw a commenter on facebook say the city has used the horses from this place in their parades..</p>
<p>Maybe someone could dig into it.. Probably nothing..</p>
<p>http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2016/11/21/horse-stable-faces-eviction-after-crackdown-on-business/</p>
<p>I found these threads after reading the Wikileaks AMA. Really grossed me out. Regardless of the truth as to whether or not this is real, the art work and "performances" tied to the people in question makes things pretty disturbing.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Pedophilia</strong>: for when you're so filthy fucking rich and can afford anything, only the most deviant, perverted things will get your rocks off.</p>
<p>I'm also of the mind that this is how they keep those in power under ultimate control.  They require them to do something like pedophilia and then they blackmail them with it.  "You won't ever betray me because if you do I'll "leak" this to the press," etc.</p></p>

<p><p>Fellow journalist here, and I'll readily admit from the jump that  I'm skeptical of whether there is a story here. </p>
<p>That said, there is nothing wrong with searching to find out, especially if feel a moral responsibility to do so. But you MUST be very, very responsible about this. I work in one of the bigger human-trafficking hubs in the country, and exposing rings like this takes a ton of organization, man-hours and, most importantly, patience. </p>
<p>You cannot expect this kind of reporting to be done in a couple days, weeks or even months. This is down, dirty, gritty, monotonous and sometimes even soul-crushing work. There will be moments where you think you have a story, but you can't get that last source to cooperate and you're back to square one. </p>
<p>To summarize, If you want to pursue it, pursue it. But it's also vital that you know for a fact, beyond all doubt, that you have every single duck in a row before you publish anything. Everything you write must be meticulously scrutinized for even the tiniest of slip-ups. Because it only takes one to zap any and all legitimacy from your story.</p>
<p>All that said, happy reporting. I wish anyone who jumps on this one luck. Go find the truth and let us know what's up.  </p></p>

<p><blockquote>
<p>To honestly decide whether that's what we are seeing in the Podesta emails, please have a look at this one example. Look at the invitation at the end of the thread. Ms Luzzatto is inviting people (among which are John and Mary Podesta) to a farm in Lovettsville. This is what she says:
We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so youâ€™ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.
Impossible, you say? They couldn't possibly be speaking about abusing the children! After all, what step-grandmother would offer three innocent children up for group abuse?
This is how invitee Drew Littman answers the invitation:
I've never had an affair, so I pass the Walter Jones test.
If you aren't aware, Walter B. Jones has for 20 years been the U.S. Representative for North Carolina's 3rd congressional district; in DC he's regarded as the absurd caricature of a do-gooder, i.e. he is a noble man indeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the context of that email that comment he made makes sense. The email looks ordinary. It only looks bad through this lense of CP. At least that is my opinion. The rest seems like very tenuous links. Almost like we are playing 6 degrees of bacon.</p></p>

<p><p>Let's say it's systematic and on purpose. Why does it matter? It's not really related to the pizzagate besides the general theme that pedophilia is everywhere. It steers away attention from stuff that is actually proven and we have hard evidence of, to stuff that is barely related and will be dismissed by many as confirmation bias.</p></p>

<p><p>All nonsense. You all should be ashamed. Where is any hard proof? Is every relevant law enforcement agency in on it too? None of them care about protecting children?</p></p>

<p><p>Look into the Dutroux affair (Belgium) and the Presidio scandal for historical precedent. These cliques infiltrate key positions in government, law enforcement, and media.</p>
<p>This is not "hard proof" that something of the sort is occurring here, of course. In fact, there is no such thing as "hard proof" outside the realm of abstract mathematics and logic. At best we can hope for hard evidence. By now, the circumstantial evidence is certainly more than considerable enough to warrant further investigation. </p>
<p>I know for a fact that if I had a friend who was known to associate with confirmed paedophiles, partook in weird occult ceremonies involving ritualistic consumption of menstrual blood and semen, proudly displayed "art" featuring naked teenagers and adult-on-child rape/murder innuendo, and operated a shady organization supposedly "helping" children in a country that a.) is a known human trafficking hotspot b.) does not consistently issue proper birth certificates, and furthermore had an underling of theirs caught red handed attempting to steal kids from their parents, I would be very suspicious to say the least.</p></p>

<p><p>It may well be bullshit, but it is definitely worth looking into if there is even a slight chance children are being abused. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.</p></p>
