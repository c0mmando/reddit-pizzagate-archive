<strong>They are fighting back: Censorship and Associating us With Actual Crazy Tinfoil Hatting</strong>
<p><p>Note that many of the most upvoted leads posted here are now missing. They are attempting to silence us. </p>
<p>Note as well that this sub is being saturated with nonsense and disinformation now. This started as an investigation into a specific case surrounding an area in DC, its associates, and empirically verifiable connections to the Clinton Foundation. Now it is being filled with diversionary rabbit holes and false leads, and even speculative new age assumptions about energy fields and the like.</p>
<p>How to counteract each of these tactics.</p>
<p>Re the censorship, archive everything online, external drives, and printed hardcopies. Email all of your friends and family. When content is deleted, re-upload it. Do NOT just leave your findings here, but pollinate them across all social media channels. Continue re-uploading, multiply your accounts, and getting the info out. </p>
<p>Re the saturation of disinformation. Debunk and downvote the false stuff if you have time, otherwise don't get bogged down in it. Remember, the shills are incompetent (they are druggies and child rapists, the bottom of the barrel). They don't understand that the decentralization and democratization of these channels form a digital natural selection for ideas. An idea's degree of truth is what determines whether it is fit to "survive" (i.e. stay afloat rather than sink). So let them post the disinformation in an attempt to make us look guilty by association. It may have worked in the 90s, but they are wasting their time now.</p>
<p>And best of all, the more they censor and spread disinfo, the more it confirms to attentive lurkers that they have something sinister to hide. </p>
<p>Their best bet at this point would literally be to flee the country. But as I said, they are incompetent. They don't understand that this information cannot be contained anymore. </p>
<p>Keep hammering the info out. Back up everything. Re-upload whatever is censored. Spread across multiple channels, not just reddit. Strike them even harder. </p>
<p>Edit: REMEMBER: there are hundreds of people who aren't posting here but who are silently reading and gathering the data. These silent lurkers are intelligent, they will notice that this sub is being filled with disinfo and they will take it as a sign that shill accounts are attempting to cover up. They will also notice the censorship.</p></p>

<p><p>Heh, the CTR army and fanatical Hillbots tried the "tinfoil hat" mocking when Bernie Sanders' supporters talked about the biased DNC, corrupt media and election fraud during the primaries. Turned out every "bat shit crazy conspiracy theory" was true. </p>
<p>The loser criminals, perverts and pedos in the Clinton Crime Syndicate have zero credibility, so to hell with them and carry on the work exposing the vermin. </p></p>

<p><p>They will die once the public wakes up to the fact they are helping pedophiles/human trafficking.  Some guy just came in as the first comment to a post yelling "tinfoil" and his post history is littered with him defending Hilary Clinton.</p></p>

<p><p>To the shills reading this: One day in the future, you're going to have live with the fact that you actively helped these child rapists get away with their monstrous crimes. You deserve to live with that soul-crushing guilt for the rest of your lives.</p>
<p>To everyone else in this subreddit:  We will win. We will expose these rapists to the world and they will get what they deserve. If they are hiring shill teams already, then they are scared.</p></p>

<p><p>Screw them.  Anyone tries to shill just point them to the Franklin Scandal, the Finders, the Presidio...and ask them why they don't want potential child rapists to be uncovered.  This has been going on ALL TOO LONG and it's time to stop it!  I don't care who thinks it's 'tinfoil hat'.  At some point, we need to wake people up about this...and IMO that time is NOW.</p></p>

<p><p>The way to stay ahead of everything is to outright state it is a conspiracy theory... they leave those alone... because it serves the narrative that these ideas are fucking insane. </p></p>

<p><p>Heap, it's only a theory until we end up producing proof that it's a fact. The second someone finds that, -send it everywhere- save it everywhere. And use a VPN, &amp; watch your back.</p></p>

<p><p>Look, it <em>might</em> be a theory in the case of Podesta (NOT), but it ain't a 'theory' in the many previous scandals.  Lots of evidence to try and convict, but no prosecutors with the bravery, ethics or balls to do the prosecuting.</p></p>

<p><p>I totally agree. (Not sure why I said, "heap"?) definitely feeling the Madeline McCann story is very compelling and don't get me wrong I think all this circumstantial evidence is VERY strong</p></p>

<p><p>Best bet is stay public as possible about it.  Keep pressuring media and even proper authorities since it's obvious they know.  They even changed national pizza day from fed 9th to nov 12 for fuck sake.  </p>
<p>Everytime you see some fluff piece online calling this bullshit sign up for the comments and link to easy sites like dcwordpress.  </p></p>
