<strong>via Knowledge Bomb Anon on 4chan: FOCUS ON HOLLYWOOD. DONT JUST LOOK AT DC. TAKING DOWN HOLLYWOOD IS THE ULTIMATE REDPILL FOR THE PUBLIC.</strong>
<p><p>Hollywood is a huge part, if not the biggest part of the pedo ring. We should be putting a lot of energy into investigating their involvement. The pizza in Hollywood would destroy the public's perception of Hollywood if it was uncovered. Given the level of celebrity worship in this country, if we expose Hollywood and connect them to D.C. then we redpill the masses.</p>
<p>Dig into the knowledge bomb threads on 4chan. Here are the most recent knowledge bombs concerning areas of focus:

<p>**Quote: "Hitting DC first is not a good idea.</p>
<p>Think strategically....... DC is military base.</p>
<p>Hollywood is a Communications/Propaganda/Supply location....."**</p>
<p>In other words, we're at war and need to think strategically. Except it's an information war. Think of the information being spread as the weapons/ammunition. They spread lies, we spread truth. We need to cut off the supply lines of lies to most effectively go after the stronghold. Otherwise they will call for reinforcements and "resupply" with more lies/propaganda. Their two major information supply routes are MSM and celebrity. Discrediting the media is huge and takes out one of their major supply routes. Celebrity is the other. If we attack DC head on they will fight back hard with MSM and celebrities. Cut off the supply lines for lies and go in for the knockout blow.</p>

"Really enjoyed the time together and I'm excited about the adventure and fun of us."</p>
<p>From his Wiki:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Together, Katzenberg and his wife have been highly active in charitable causes. They donated the multimillion-dollar Katzenberg Center to Boston University's College of General Studies, citing that the school gave their two children the "love of education."[35] They also donated the Marilyn and Jeffrey Katzenberg Center for Animation at the University of Southern California.</p>
<p>In addition to serving as Chairman of the Board for the Motion Picture and Television Fund Foundation, Katzenberg sits on the boards or serves as a trustee of AIDS Project Los Angeles, American Museum of the Moving Image, California Institute of the Arts, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Geffen Playhouse, Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts and The Simon Wiesenthal Center. Together with DreamWorks Animation, Katzenberg founded the DreamWorks Animation Academy of Inner-City Arts in 2008. In recognition of his efforts, Katzenberg received the 85th Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award at the 2013 American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Governors Awards Presentation[36] on December 1 at The Ray Dolby Ballroom at Hollywood &amp; Highland Center.[37]</p>
<p>Katzenberg has an estimated worth of $800 million according to Forbes. Katzenberg is reported to have donated over $3.5 million in political contributions since 1979: 33% ($1.171+ million) to Democrats, 66% ($2.33+ million) to special interest groups without party affiliations, and less than 1% ($7,000) to Republicans.[38]</p>

<p><p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Hitting DC first is not a good idea.</p>
<p>Think of it like a war. DC is military base. Hollywood is a Communications/Propaganda/Supply location. Cut off the supply lines first. Don't go after the military stronghold right off the bat.</p></p>

<p><p>After Pizzagate broke, I've gone back and watched a handful of coming of age movies from the 80s and 90s. Lots of pedo symbols and odd jokes that aren't really funny. There's likely dots connecting to DC, but I don't think we should allocate a bunch of time on this. We need bigger bombshells on Podesta/Clinton Foundation first</p></p>

<p><p>No. Pauly Shore and Heath Ledger. I think coming of age movies are likely picking grounds for Hollywood pedos. However, Sean Astin was in one of the movies with Pauly Shore, Encino Man. Lots of spirals throughout the movie, and jokes that are more creepy than actually funny. Nothing conclusive really, other than the symbols showing up way too often to be coincidence. Almost nothing is coincidence in cinematography.</p></p>

<p><p>Son in law, Encino man, and 10 things i hate about you are the ones I've gone back and watched so far. I don't put much weight into the symbols, but they continually show up in some of the films. If anyone were to be blatant and obvious about this sick behavior, I would put my money on Hollywood. </p></p>

<p><p>Disney also had the people drawing penis's in their movies. I thought that might have something to do with all of this. Maybe it's a stretch? But falls in line with the pervasive nature of adult's trying to corrupt children/subliminal messaging.</p>

<p><p>"Lost Boys" is pedo victim central - two Coreys, Keifer Sutherland, others</p>
<p>Also, "Lucas" - it's on the set of that movie where an "older young actor" (my guess is co-star Charlie Sheen) raped Corey Haim, according to Feldman</p></p>

<p><p>Hey guys, I saw this video about a week ago after this all broke. I thought the same thing, OP, and went digging through to see what Hollywood cases were hushed up.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS5n2L5Ga0A">This one about Charlie Sheen is pretty eye opening and frightening.</a> It's unnerving how certain Corey Feldman is of the problem and his inability to act.</p>
<p>Elijah Wood has spoken out about the plague of pedophilia in Hollywood as well, but I haven't quite yet looked into what he's said.</p>
<p>Maybe we can see what Hollywood execs are linked to politicians? Are there any connections between these fuckheads?</p></p>

<p>i think it'd prob have to be a big family-friendly actor to really hit the public hard tho not a behind-the-scenes person, and a huge portion of the tales of hollywood CSA seems to be about producers/directors and people of that nature. but i'm sure there's actors involved too, this shit is everywhere.</p></p>

<p><p>I still believe MJ didn't do what they accused him of. Saw a video where he talks to his fans about some of the things we've been talking about (not about pedo). Also about all the lies from MSM. Begging people to wake up.
He also told a few people close to him that he was in danger and that "they" were trying to kill him. He was scared. He was trying to go against the system, getting the truth out and they wanted to take him down, first by damaging his reputation and finally to silence him for good. </p></p>

<p><p>I can't remember, it's been a long time since I looked into the whole thing. Will try and look it up and see what that was about...but if it was after his death they could have been planted there. But who knows, maybe he did do these things, I just always thought his death was a little weird.</p></p>

<p><p>you gotta understand the blackmail aspect of it = MJ prolly was part of the ring, then was exposed by the ring </p>
<p>same as Polanski, Chaplin, Fatty Arbuckle, Marilyn =  all possible scenarios that fit this </p>
<p>MJ evidence was covered up until just this year when the sherrif investigaing FINALY released photos and details of the evidence found in Neverland - you should take a look at it and reconsider your stance on him</p>
<ul>
<li>or again he could have been setup....who knows</li>
</ul>
<p>http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/06/michael-jackson-police-reports-pornography-collection</p>
<p>then consider he died suddenly of overdose</p>
<p>same as prince, cobain, morrison, hendrix on and on</p>
<p>(just my crazy theory of course)</p>
<p>EDIT looks like radar online took the story down, swept under the rug again</p>

<p><p>Yeah I see what you mean and thx for the link to the article, it's pretty bad. 
I wonder why he was found innoncent on all charges then. But as we know a lot can be fixed.</p>
<p>Found this in the comment section http://vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/michael-jacksons-neverland-ranch-mind-control-programming-site/ </p>
<p>It's messed up. I do still think something was odd about the circumstances surrounding his death, but guess we'll never know what really happened.</p></p>

<p><p>I doubt Jackson was part of the ring based simply on his childhood as a child star with the Jackson 5, which to me reads much more like the background of the victims in this ring. He was extremely abused and exploited and this is reflected in his later life.</p>
<p>If anything he might have been a victim groomed for membership  who was deemed too unstable/a liability and preemptively smeared as a result.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm 100% convinced that Britney Spears' mental break a few years ago was a result of years of sexual abuse at the hands of her MKUltra Handlers and other music big wigs, probably going back into her childhood. She kept on going on about how she didn't want "them" touching her any more while she was shaving her head. And then after all of that blew over, when Diane Sawyer interviewed her, <a href="https://youtu.be/DMpguv7st7s">she had a major personality break right on camera</a>. </p></p>

<p><p>It's an old CIA program where they were testing the use of drugs, with a heavy focus on LSD, and physical and sexual abuse (among other things) to force confessions out of people or to put them under a form of "mind control." Heavy trauma can actually create fractured personalities in people which can be activated by trigger words (like "weird" for Britney apparently) or hand signs. It is thought that even though the program was officially discontinued in the 1970s, that it has continued to be refined by the CIA and the techniques are used to control people, music celebrities being chief among them. Why music celebs? Beats me...but a number of them have shown signs of multiple personalities that are triggered by certain things (Beyonce, Britney, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry...whose ex-husband funnily enough became a conspiracy theorist shortly after their divorce lol). </p>

<p><p>yeah Sam Lufti's involvement is always a pretty big sign to me. I just picked up on a new connection with him- Courtney Love is circled in Epstien's black book, she has worked with Sam Lufti now too. He was there for Amanda Byne's breakdown. Who else?</p></p>

<p><p>Hey guys, I recently found this youtube group called littlelightstudios that say how tv and movies are a form of self hypnosis because your brain switches on to alpha wave state. ALSO, the main thing I want to point out is that DISNEY has many symbols and refernces to trying to shape children's worldview in a sinister way. It has been shown that Hollywood is a place full of pedophiles, even ELIJAH WOOD talks about it as well. Even the word HOLLYWOOD, Holly is the wood that witches use to make their wands.</p>
<p>http://www.witchipedia.com/herb:holly</p>
<p>Watch this video by littlelightstudios!</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/jV64e1vSTn8</p>
<p>You may not be Christian, but with all the stuff occuring nowadays with looking into pizzagate, I want EVERYONE to take a chance looking at this video!</p>
<p>Littlelightstudios not only have videos on disney, but super heroes and Hollywood in general too.</p></p>

<p><p>Yes, um, I'm not going to go that far.  Since the stated goal of the Church is not to promote sin.  Whereas the stated goal(s) of many places in Hollywood is actually to promote it.</p>
<p>Are there bad apples in every sector though?  Yes, absolutely.  </p>
<p>Do those bad apples represent the stated mission and purpose of their respective organizations? Is my question.</p>
<p>And let's not forget that there <em>has</em> been known communist and homosexual (priests) infiltration of the Church, not to mention, the recent discovery of Podesta's apparent groups actively infiltrating in order to destroy from within.</p>
<p>"But I tell you if any one causes one of these little ones to stumble, it would be better for him if a large millstone were hung around his neck and he were drown in the depths of the sea." Matthew 18:6.   </p>
<p>Expose and encourage people to repent.</p></p>

<p><p>Again, I'm not going to disavow that it is or isn't.  But I will say that the express purpose of the Church is NOT to promote sin. </p>
<p>Jesus is definitely about protecting the weak and vulnerable.</p></p>

<p><p>Ok.  I'm not going to use this thread for that discussion.  Suffice it to say that I am a Bible-believing, born again Catholic who believes the Catholic Church to be the Church founded by Our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>We have a mission on this thread right now to help save babies lives and souls though and I want to focus on that.  (not a time to discuss Protestant-Catholic debates).  Thanks for respecting and let's pray for these babies!</p></p>

<p><p>I put this out on /pol/ .... I believe there to be ties to Texas and Houston. Remeber the strange room 322 at hotel ZaZa? HTX is Bush territory (Franklin coverup), home base of Halliburton, and ranked number 2 on the list of cities in the US for child sex trafficking. With Zaza they plan on opening another hotel in near memorial city mall; in an area called the energy corridor. The energy corridor its self has a lot of problems with prostitution. To my knowledge there was even an apartment complex that was a front for a brothel nicknamed "empty hollows".</p></p>

<p><p>Stop dragging MJ into this BS. They never found any CP in his house, no DNA, no nothing, and he was innocent. The story that they found "something" in Neverland is ridicolous and fake as fuck, he wasn't even in Neverland after the trial, so how the fuck they could find CP or anything, when they found nothing in 2003-2005? Go to read court transcripts and don't believe everything you read or see in the media. The same media who wanted to destroy him, are now trying to destroy Trump. Wake up people.
Btw. Trump supported him in the media during the trial. He knew he was innocent. </p></p>

<p><p>Exactly! People really should do some research, especially now when they know how the media can lie all the time about everything. They don't give a fuck if they'll destroy someone's life as long as they can make money. Same with his "vitcims" and accusers. </p></p>

<p><p>Yeah. And using Radaronline as a reliable source despite the man being dragged through court cases for years, the FBI seizing all his computers and investigating him for ten years; confirming he possessed no child porn and clearing him completely? It's literally laughable what people believe. <em>Radaronline said it so it must be true hur-dur, it's not like they collect tasty revenue off trashy fabricated click-bait</em>.</p></p>

<p><p>Yes, I'm so sick of this garbage. They'll never leave him alone, even after his death. Every sane person should see that something's not right, it's insane that the media and all of these sick people wanted to destroy him for decades. It's not normal. And they are still trying, they're still making up "he molested me 1000 years ago" and "they found CP in Neverland" stories, they're still claiming that he was a sick motherfucker. Fuck them all, fuck the media and tabloids. He was a good man. </p></p>

<p><p>He was a good man, too good for this sick world. What infuriates me the most is that all the resources are out there, as you said; the court transcripts, the shadiness of his accusers, the evidence that gutter trash wanted him dead, the case presented by his defence, the <em>truth</em>, and yet people don't care. They'd rather believe the bullshit Radaronline spew. They'd rather believe money-grabbing worms crawling out the woodwork. They'd rather see the downfall of an innocent man, because it makes money.</p></p>

<p><p>Well, maybe it shouldn't be surprising that some people don't want to hear the truth because they're too stupid and really don't give a damn about anything, but when I see Trump supporters thinking the same way, when they know how fake and bias the media are... it's very dissapointing. </p></p>

<p><p>Anyone associated with Marina Abramovic! Somebody needs to make a list with links to prove why they should be in the list.  I remember awhile back Miley Cyrus and her dad had some VERY weird stuff that came out about them that I thought was extremely inappropriate! She was hysterical when Hillary lost!</p></p>

<p><p>I doubt most of you guys follow hollywood gossip blogs, so you may not know about the himmmm situation a few years back - basically a guy commented on a hollywood gossip blog claiming to be an insider in the industry, and spilled some serious beans. It was speculated to be Robert Downey Jr, but RDJ publicly stated it wasn't him. <a href="http://gawker.com/5893793/did-robert-downey-jr-really-just-accuse-kirk-douglas-of-a-brutal-rape_">Overview</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.gossiprocks.com/forum/blind-items/178501-mystery-himmmm.html">Diane Jenkins</a> comes up a lot, for her book Room 23 - a "coffee table book" that has been rumored to be her 'client list'  of celebs that have sex for money. <a href="http://lunaticoutpost.com/thread-420657-page-14.html">But it really got people talking</a> about <a href="http://www.lipstickalley.com/showthread.php/684377-X-men-director-pool-party-tea-zac-effron-Taylor-lautner">long-running pedophelia in Hollywood</a> if you have the patience to comb through it. </p>
<p>It's all rumors and blogs, obviously nothing concrete, but where there's smoke there may be fire. </p></p>

<p><p>I put this out on /pol/ .... I believe there to be ties to Texas and Houston. Remeber the strange room 322 at hotel ZaZa? HTX is Bush territory (Franklin coverup), home base of Halliburton, and ranked number 2 on the list of cities in the US for child sex trafficking. With Zaza they plan on opening another hotel in near memorial city mall; in an area called the energy corridor. The energy corridor its self has a lot of problems with prostitution. To my knowledge there was even an apartment complex that was a front for a brothel nicknamed "empty hollows".</p></p>

<p><p>Video BANNED from Hollywood;</p>
<p><strong>Open Secret Trailer</strong></p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JpHUaMBARU</p>
<p><strong>An Open Secret Unedited Full Documentary</strong></p>
<p>"AN OPEN SECRET looks at the lives of children betrayed and abandoned by a system that essentially funnels them towards sexual predators without any oversight or regard for their safety. It documents not only these young peoples' experiences, but also how some have emerged stronger for their speaking out. It beg the questions of why children working in entertainment aren't afforded the same protections they are afforded at school, and argues for more effective treatment and stronger penalties for child sex offenders."</p>

<p><p>Just looked up some Charley Sheen quotes.
https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/c/charlie_sheen.html</p>
<p>I mean he had his publicized mental breakdown but some of the imagery he uses in context is just creepy.</p>
<p>"The run I was on made Sinatra, Flynn, Jagger, Richards, all of them look like droopy-eyed armless children"</p>
<p>"What they're not ready for is guys like you and I and Nails and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life, that we are high priests, Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes."</p>
<p>Don't mind if I do....</p></p>

<p><p>Pedophilia in Hollywood goes on with speculation that <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/survival/2015/06/mind-control-pedophilia-vip-ring-survivor-breaks-silence-cops-stood-guard-as-i-was-raped-by-politicians-2572892.html">MK ULTRA</a> programs are still going on there. In addition, it's said that MK ULTRA victims (like Cathy O'Brien) were peddled to high level politicians.</p>
<p>MK Ultra was carried out by the RAND corporation. This institution is also headquartered in CA, and to this day they do research about children, trauma, and children on psychotropic drugs. </p>
<p>I'm doing more research about the following below <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dx9oy/tavistockhollywood_connection/">here</a>, if you want to check it out: </p>
<p>The CEO of RAND is on the board of advisors for a nonprofit (Everychild) that gives money to various orphanages all over the world. Before becoming Everychild, it managed an orphanage in Romania and got caught for misappropriating the money. Recently, this group has also been given funds by the Clinton Global Initiative.</p></p>

"Really enjoyed the time together and I'm excited about the adventure and fun of us."</p>
<p>Jeffrey Katzenberg, CEO of Dreamworks</p>
<p>From his Wiki:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Together, Katzenberg and his wife have been highly active in charitable causes. They donated the multimillion-dollar Katzenberg Center to Boston University's College of General Studies, citing that the school gave their two children the "love of education."[35] They also donated the Marilyn and Jeffrey Katzenberg Center for Animation at the University of Southern California.</p>
<p>In addition to serving as Chairman of the Board for the Motion Picture and Television Fund Foundation, Katzenberg sits on the boards or serves as a trustee of AIDS Project Los Angeles, American Museum of the Moving Image, California Institute of the Arts, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Geffen Playhouse, Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts and The Simon Wiesenthal Center. Together with DreamWorks Animation, Katzenberg founded the DreamWorks Animation Academy of Inner-City Arts in 2008. In recognition of his efforts, Katzenberg received the 85th Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award at the 2013 American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Governors Awards Presentation[36] on December 1 at The Ray Dolby Ballroom at Hollywood &amp; Highland Center.[37]</p>
<p>Katzenberg has an estimated worth of $800 million according to Forbes. Katzenberg is reported to have donated over $3.5 million in political contributions since 1979: 33% ($1.171+ million) to Democrats, 66% ($2.33+ million) to special interest groups without party affiliations, and less than 1% ($7,000) to Republicans.[38]</p>
