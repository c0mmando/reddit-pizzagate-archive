<strong>Continuation on creepy lyrics from 'The Apes'</strong>
<p><p>Earlier I started this thread, in which I tried to listen and uncover the lyrics of a few ape songs, and I found quite some disturbing things. It is linked here https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5donp3/weird_lyrics_in_songs_written_by_the_apes/</p>
<p>Anyway I was listening to the 'Children of brainbrow/brainbro song again, and before I couldn't quite make out the whispering but I think I hear it now. I thought I would repost this, because I think this might be of significance, and also its another weird thing that adds to the whole story. I have updated the lyrics after hearing some parts better as well. </p>
<p>The song lyrics go as follows</p>
<p><strong>Children of brainbrow-brainbro</strong></p>
<p>Fountain of hundreds we miss/Five ten or hundred we miss</p>
<p>So many children in a village like this</p>
<p>Boys and girls long haired dwellers</p>
<p>Home of the good (goods/boobs??) and countless sellers </p>
<p>Child to captain, are we here to stay? '</p>
<p>Lair on no hands, to lead us astray</p>
<p>Too bloated brains, brains without bodies</p>
<p>Their mental powers, controlling the parties </p>
<p>Far, far, far from your cities</p>
<p>They're building robot bodies to spread disease</p>
<p>Watch your step, don't spill the wax</p>
<p>Black and white powers, patrolling the (marches??)</p>
<p>Legence of lonely and rich who will march in</p>
<p>Made with their hearts and you'll pay the Audis/odd ears??</p>
<p>Truly the hooman that brains without bodies</p>
<p>Far, far, far from your cities</p>
<p>They're building robot bodies to spread disease</p>
<p>Workers selling goods</p>
<p>But their bodies need completion</p>
<p>A candle is lit for each new day</p>
<p>(And then the creepy ass whispering I couldnt make out earlier)</p>
<p>They'll learn our thoughts, our words our way. </p>
<p>Children of the brains (repeated multiple times) </p>
<p>Learning our thoughts</p>
<p>Learning about love </p>
<p>I might be too involved with this, but this song is ridden with pedophile references isn't it? It's especially chilling how they discuss people in power in relation to children, and describing them as 'goods' with countless sellers. They also explicitly state in the song that it is about missing children, who are led astray and are asking whether they are here to stay. I'm not sure what the whole brains part is about, but it seems to me like its about children who lack the sexual brain? And therefore they're trying to develop children who will have such a developed brain with the accompanied body? At least that's kind of the message I get from the creepy fucking whispering at the end. I have also noticed that they might be using 'hair' as a codeword in their lyrics for 'adults' /'children who are developing into adults' and are therefore to old. </p>
<p>Well, I thought to make a new thread in case there's anyone who would like to overanalyze the shit out of this and other songs by them and autist out with me.</p></p>

<p><p>Thanks for your contribution! You really helped with some parts I couldn't quite make out. One question though, do you really think they're singing captain captain! I swear I could hear child to captain</p></p>

<p><p>I'm pretty sure I hear captain, captain but the lyrics are difficult to hear generally. </p></p>
