<strong>Comet PingPong Bathroom</strong>
<p><p>Guys! This is freaking me out!</p>
<p>A few years ago, WAYYYY before the pizza gate thing blew open, I went to DC on a business trip and afterward, my colleagues took us all to Comet Ping Pong in DC.</p>
<p>I couldn't put my finger on it then, but looking back I now am beginning to understand what was so weird.</p>
<p>The bathrooms there are almost "hidden", and I remember leaving my group to go use the John. But once I found them, it seemed like they were all full (each single-door unit is "mixed use"). Well, I waited for a sec when from behind one of the doors a lady and her daughter emerge. I can't explain it but they gave me the weirdest look, like was I supposed to meet them or something? Or had I caught them in the middle of something? It just felt very odd. After that, they disappeared on their way, and I did my business. </p>
<p>Now I'm thinking the bathrooms might be hidden doorways to the sex rooms. Has anyone gone on location and checked for secret doors in the bathrooms?</p>
<p>Very weird.</p></p>

<p><p>Someone on reddit visited. Said he asked for a hot dog with walnut sauce. Then he said the cashier gave him a weird look and said he didn't know what he was talking about. Said he went home and saw a van with black windows parked outside his house. Thinks they got his info cause he paid with a credit card. Said his buddy was coming over to help him and then his account was deleted ASAP </p></p>

<p><p>Something is weird there. We need feet on grOund in DC to investigate and come back to us re:restrooms. We need photos inside, of the sliding doors, etc. Maybe we can find the secret passageways.</p></p>

<p><p>No but there was nothing particularly dramatic about it.   He went in and took I think three pics, one of a hidden room and one of the pizza he ordered.   The rest of the posts were basically "don't eat the pizza retard the toppings are kids!"  </p></p>

<p><p>To any super sleuths in DC: if you go investigate, DO NOT MAKE IT OBVIOUS! Just dress yuppie-ish and act cool. Please get photos in the bathrooms (all if possible) and check for secret wall panels, hatches or doors behind the murals. THANK YOU!!!</p></p>

<p><p>If you look at Comet Pizza's yelp reviews, the weird, hidden and dirty bathrooms are a constant theme that people keep bringing up. </p>
<p>This is definitely not consistent with their high status as a place where movers and shakers come for top-ranked pizza. It sounds to me like something to repel the peons and give them a reason to not come there. </p>
<p>https://www.yelp.com/biz/comet-ping-pong-washington</p>
<h3>UPDATE</h3>
<p>Note: they may have cleansed some of the reviews I was talking about (too lazy to confirm though). Luckily I took screenshots. </p>
<p>http://imgur.com/a/a09et</p>
<p>I don't think I got the ones mentioning the restrooms, but I believe that at least two of them described as being similar to a gas station or truck stop in its foulness. </p>
<h3>UPDATE 2</h3>
<p>I just went through and searched the reviews for "bathroom" and took screenshots of all the ones mentioning how they were dirty. </p>

<p><p>Yeah it does look like a rack from some kind of store. Could still be of use in a restaurant if they got a deal on it or something. Everything in this place is kind of hodge podge anyways. Don't know what it would be doing by the bathrooms though. And I'm not saying it <em>isn't</em> suspicious, just trying to come up with a reasonable explanation.</p></p>

<p><p>That looks like a good match. It is odd, and certainly seems out of place. Still, not ideal for storing children because it would be too top heavy. But I don't know why it would be out there with bottled drinks in it.</p></p>

<p><p>Someone HAS TO snoop around in there. I can't say exactly why but I have a major hunch that the bathrooms have something to do with it. My feeling is there are secret walls or the bathroom can be used as a secret portal to the sex dungeons. Think about it, no one would blink an eye at an adult taking a child into a restroom, happens all the time! Perfect cover! WE MUST INVESTIGATE!</p></p>

<p><p>Thing is, what if they have cameras in the bathroom? If you poke around they will be sure to notice, you can't exactly go looking for a hidden door without being obvious...</p>
<p>I'm wondering if their mirrors are two way. I have seen that you can 'test' it by putting your finger on the mirror, but I believe that has been dis proven.</p>
<p>Seriously, why have hidden bathrooms in a 'kid friendly' place? So many things they do are so counter to the fact they are kid friendly its creepy.</p></p>

<p><p>Again, the two way mirror thing would probably be a 50/50 thing even if the test showed 'positive'. It is basically seeing if there is a gap between your finger and the mirror when pressed up against the glass. But some mirrors do that without being two way so :/</p>
<p>I don't know what I think about going there and don't have the money to be a customer. The most I could do is walk in and ask to use the bathroom but I feel like that is blatantly obvious.</p>
<p>I do have an idea which I wont post for reasons that are clear, but even so I don't know how much they are watching out for people now that attention is being drawn to them. I'm not much worried for my own safety if it means saving these kids, but I also don't want to compromise any investigations or put anyone I know in harms way.</p></p>

<p><p>just smash all the mirrors. bring lots of friends as witnesses to make sure you don't get disappeared into a secret passage or down a trap door. if there's nothing behind the mirrors then you say sorry and pay for the mirrors. seriously a mob of concerned citizens should just go in during business hours and look around. everything about that place does not add up.</p></p>

<p><p>If I can't afford a pizza....I'm pretty sure I can't afford to get sued.</p>
<p>I know I'm new here but this is just a little silly and makes it hard to take this sub seriously for other new comers. </p>
<p>While I understand the frustration and enthusiasm, I think it is important to take a step back and think about this all realistically. </p>
<p>Plus, I wouldn't doubt if they have already cleared and cleaned out any rooms if there are any.</p></p>

<p><p>they can't say they have cameras in the bathroom without getting into real trouble. DC has voyeurism laws to protect you the average bathroom user. so if the say we have you on camera in the bathroom looking around for hidden cameras..... then you need to sue them.</p>
<p>Also if you go to CP, go with friends and make sure they know where you are going and you plan on coming back so if you "accidentally" go missing.. you have witnesses, also probably doesn't hurt to have 911 ready to go</p></p>

<p><p>You can't see in at all... it's a solid door that leads into "single" bathroom units. In fact, you can barely even tell it is a door. It was just really weird. I was waiting there because they all "seemed" full but when the lady and little girl came out, I can't describe it, it just felt WEIRD. I only started to piece it all together now.</p></p>

<p><p><em>edit</em> See my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5crl4b/comet_pingpong_bathroom/d9z2tl7/">comment below</a>, unsure if the suspected link I found relates to this at all but may have found an unexpected lead* Ummm...has anyone else downloaded the video from an external site? This is the file name: GeorgeLamberisinstagram_BLjfLlBBxCN. Has anyone looked into George Lamberi or George Lamberis (unsure if the filename cutoff an apostrophe)</p></p>

<p><p>Ok, this may have been a bad link initially. The site I used for whatever reason names every downloaded file starting with that, George Lamberis (makes no sense). Trying other sites didn't produce the same results on the same or similar file name. The website though seems to be ran by George Lamberis and seeing the comment in this, maybe I accidentally stumbled upon a new link in my own paranoia.</p></p>

<p><p>It's not a 2 way mirror.  The bathrooms are surrounded on all four sides by 1) the doors/hallway to the bathroom  2) an outdoor parking lot 3) the hallway to the outdoor parking lot   4) the big room with ping pong tables. </p></p>

<p><p>Do they have unisex bathrooms or did you go into the ladies room by mistake? Is this the first time you experience a little girl needing help from her mother to go to the bathroom? Do people generally give you the same look if they are supposed to meet you that they would if you had just caught them molesting their children?</p></p>
