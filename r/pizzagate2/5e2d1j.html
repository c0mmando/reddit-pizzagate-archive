<strong>Is anyone looking at the whole Michael Jackson thing a little differently now?</strong>
<p><p>No really sure what to say about it - but hell.</p>
<p>Edit: Not implying guilt towards MJ here. If anything he may have been a victim beyond our ability to comprehend at the time.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah, Michael was obviously scared shitless and I don't blame him.... If these gguys were blackmailing me and everyone simply dismissed it as me being schizophrenic/Wacko Jacko I'd go insane.</p>
<p>Honestly I don't know the details but do you think Michael was forced to have surgery, defamed for pedophilia simply to show Michael what they are capable of doing to him?</p></p>

<p><p>I've watched some documentaries on mj and I gotta say, he has definitely been through some shit as a child. You can see it in how he talks, interacts and lived as an adult. He was a phenomenal singer but had some serious deep rooted issues. I know he had multiple lawsuits/complaints against him in regards to children being at his place. It all makes a little more sense now...</p></p>

<p><p>WTF? If you think that he had something to do with this pedophile ring or some shit - no! He was innocent, he had a trial, they never found any CP in Neverland, they found nothing on him. People who accused him had a history of fraud and they were crazy as fuck. Go to read the court transcripts and stop fucking comparing his accusations to this pizzagate shit, because they are two different cases. You obviously know nothing about MJ, so please, go to read court/FBI documents, learn something and stop saying stupid things.</p></p>

<p><p>"Mr. Jackson did possess “photos of nude children but they weren’t sexually graphic,” Mr. Zonen, a former Santa Barbara assistant DA, said. “They weren’t children engaged in sexual activity, and there was no child pornography. There were no videos involving children. There were videos that were seized, but they were conventional adult sexually graphic material. No children involved."</p>

<p><p>you are in serious denial my friend </p>
<p>the books WERE "art" books of nude children!!!   nothing sexualy graphic, but so what!!!    who collects art books like that with out having a serious interest </p>
<p>the photos were on Radar of the evidence - but taken down within a week.
swept under the rug</p>
<p>I liked MJ as well.....it was a shock to know, one day you will discover truth, as long as you are not blind to it</p></p>

<p><p>Are you stupid or just a troll? There wasn't any book with nude children you dumbass, just an art books. The author of the alleged "pedophile book" debunked this story as well and he's very angry at the media. 
http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-artist-photo-michael-jackson-1.3651598 In 2003 they found books with nude children, but it wasn't fucking CP ok? Photos of nude children aren't automatically CP, there were some photos of Lord of the Flies movie or some shit like that. 100% legal. Period.</p></p>

<p><p>wow seriously - if you are going to defend his book collection of nude children as 
"art"  then you should know you sound just like a typical NAMBLA member  = YOU ARE THE TROLL</p>
<p>ok....lol..... </p>
<p>believe what you want to believe - I saw the photos of evidence, legal "art" or not  - it was of NUDE CHILDREN - and many involving BONDAGE </p>
<p>what dont you get about that?</p>
<p>FOUND THE RETRACTED RADAR ONLINE ARTICLE WHICH WAS SAVED</p>
<p>LOOK FOR YOURSELF  (SAFE TO VIEW / NUDITY CENSORED BY RADAR)</p>
<p>https://web.archive.org/web/20160621193645/http://radaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/mj-docs.pdf</p>
<p>STARR OCKENGA was the author of one of the books called "DRESSUP":  (NSFW NUDE "LEGAL ART" CHILDREN)</p>
<p>https://www.google.com/search?q=starr+ockenga+book&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRsKbzhbrQAhUB9GMKHWKlBDEQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1242&amp;bih=602#tbm=isch&amp;q=starr+ockenga+dressup</p>
<p>With Marina Abramovic and Tony Podestas "art"  - we are now aware many of the people attracted to these sick things do it under the guise of "ART " - the line: "it's just art, protected by freedom of speech"  is a full on bullshit excuse</p>
<p>ART OR NOT - THIS IS WRONG FOR A SUSPECTED PEDOPHILE WHO HAD CHILDREN SLEEP IN HIS BED TO OWN</p></p>

<p><p>Ok, they were nude, so fucking what? I'll just repeat what the attorney R. Zonen said: "They weren’t children engaged in sexual activity." He was in the court and he knows what they found and what they didn't found. I don't have to believe that he was innocent, I KNOW it. He was found not guilty because they found nothing illegal in his house. The jury couldn't convict him just because he had some legal art book in his house. And what about M. Angelo and all of these nude little cute angels on his paitings and Sistine Chapel ceiling? He was a pedophile too? Lol.</p></p>

<p><p>The fake/original photo I gave you is pretty much the evidence that whatever they're saying now in the tabloids, it's fucking fake. It's a fake story. I'm done, if it's more convinient for you to believe a fucking TABLOID, instead of what the attorneys or the police had to say, then I have nothing to do here.</p></p>

<p><p>Your link, it's loading and loading and it won't open, I'd love to see it but I can't. But if it's an article from Radaronline, then I saw it earlier. Don't worry, you can open my link, it's nothing illegal. It's an original photo from the book and fake photo from Radar article.</p></p>

<p><p>This story is fake and created by the shitty tabloid Radaronline. He wasn't even living in Neverland after the 2005 trial, so how they could find anything there after his death? It doesn't make any sense. They didn't even search this place after the trial because they had no reason to do so, they couldn't go there without a search warrant or suspicion of commiting a crime. The prosecutor who worked on this case and police debunked this story and said that they found nothing illegal in Neverland. </p></p>

<p><p>They searched his house TWICE and found nothing. They wouldn't let him free if he had something illegal, believe me. Well, you don't have to believe me, just read the court transcripts.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah... I think the whole problem with MJ was he was ordering "off-the-menu" way too often... same thing that got Weiner busted. </p></p>

<p><p>His father was clearly deranged, and used to beat the shit out of them. It wouldn't surprise me in the least if there was severe sexual abuse, and to find that he pimped them to various industry people. Most abusers have been abused themselves, which is why i always thought it was entirely possible, even likely that MJ became one. He was clearly severely disturbed,.</p></p>
