<strong>Why I think the NyTimes helped to save this subreddit, (and giving general critique aswell as praise for why this subreddit is so unique)</strong>
<p><p>Somewhere around the 13. November I stumbled upon this subreddit, coming from The_donald and have since dug my way through through the largest, and most fact based Conspiracy-theory, or better spoken: crowdsourced open source Investigation I have ever seen.</p>
<p>But before speaking about what I think makes this subreddit (and aswell the others related to this unique), I want to give critique about things which bother me.</p>
<p>What concerns me is that in the last week more and more people started pouring in,  taking everything for granted what was posted, with a typical "conspiracy theorist" state of mind. Quite some of them showed Schizophrenic behaviour, which I briefly want to mention here because I have seen online communitys detoriating this way.</p>
<p>But Today there have been a huge amount of Users posting critique from which I belive they originate from the NY times which has mentioned this Subreddit in one of their articles. We should bid this new Users welcome,  and recognize that they really have the potential to "save" this subreddit. </p>
<p>Assuming the innocence of everyone Investigated here should have the highest priority. It cant happen that these people receive death threads because of bad recherched facts or people wildly speculating.
One such example is Tony podestas handkerchief-code mentioned in the emails:</p>
<p>Ofcourse it makes people curious why they have to hide certain private events in code-speech whilest talking in plain-text about criminal activities as pay to play (citibank giving a "recommendation" list of who should be in obamas cabinet 4 weeks before he won), clinton receiving huge donations of saudi arabia whilst knowing that they are financing ISIS, etc, etc,...
But what is perfectly okay is if John Podesta and others are visiting private satanic  SM like "spiritcooking" dinners. What is not okay are the little lies I have come accross: Nowhere in the internet it is stated that handkerchief code-white means to have sex with minors, in fact, It translates often to "save sex". Yet one could read literally everywhere that this was proof that Mr Podesta would be a Child offender- just plainly wrong.
Ofcourse There are many suspicious things around him and the clinton group, often raising more than eyebrow, reaching from his brother collecting "art" from Bliana Durdjevic portraying abused childs to Mr Clinton traveling 29 times on Epsteins pedo -plane "lolita express" and assuming he was on his pagan Temple on "orgy island" aswell; Mrs Clinton need to be informed on Child trafficer Laura Sylsby on haiti, etc, etc,...</p>
<p>But again: innocent until proven guilty. Keep speculation form hard facts
Having an occult/satanic kind of religion - perfectly fine. Attending creepy Art events - also perfectly fine. What you guys trying to find here are hard facts of people involved in Child traffic. focus on that.</p>
<p>What has me made believe in America once again is the kind of civil courage I have seen in the forums against the lying mainstream media, reaching sometimes the level of an open source intelligence agency.</p>
<p>Great people from the_donald, 4 and 8 chan Investigating emails, with some kind of hierarchy where Information was only moved up the chain if it really contained something newsworthy. This way, it was possible for them to analyze the content of several thousand of emails within hours and simultaneously making background-checks of every relevant people mentioned, and bringing it into context with already existing knowledge.
Once something was discovered, meme-wizzards have created powerful memes with all the info condensed into one sticky image easy to process for the normies.
Then meme warriors have flooded Twitter, facebook, and every other news-site with this memes, raising public consciousness and finally forcing the mainstream-media to attribute the issue. I think this has rapidly shifted the media-landscape from a few news-sites having a monopoly on news to a more distributed landscape where Everyone can be "the media". Of course there are "the crazies" with for e.g. false. radical, violent views, but once people delve into this landscape It will only sharpen their senses to think skeptical and critical about every news they receive.</p>
<p>This being said, what we are seeing now is a partial change of the powerstructure, proving that democracy exists, moving the good ones up to the top as for e.g. ret. gen Michael Flynn.
All thanks to you the people, finally waking up.</p></p>

<p><p>I'd like a mod to comment here. The mod that tagged this was given full permissions an hour or so ago. I think we're due an explanation. </p>
<p>We've talked about this already, guys. Please don't keep making the same mistakes. I was fine when newfoundland got modded because pizzathrowaway conveyed his trust. But, this guys has full permissions. An explanation is certainly in order.</p>
<p>I'm not keeping this conversation private again. I'll make a thread if I have to.</p></p>

<p><p>What's your take on the actual handkerchief reference? Real estate agent calls it's a black and white handkerchief, Susan calls it a handkerchief, with a map that seems pizza related. Why the change in description? </p>

<p><p>It sounds like you've put a moral boundary on it for your own mental benefit. You're willing to make the leap to sex parties but not to sex parties with children. </p></p>

<p><p>It does make sense in the context of the keywords used on the instagram. The owner of a pizza restaurant discussing pizza is not convincing use of code. Podesta discussing pizza in relation to pizza restaurant is not convincing of code. #chickenlovers and a little kid? The ejaculation murals in a "kid friendly" ping pong parlor?</p></p>

<p><p>This thread is speculative or just cheerleading. </p>
<p>Why is this marked as interesting, despite providing no new evidence that could give us a lead? Can we keep that tag for posts that contain evidence that can help further the investigation?</p></p>

<p><p>I agree. I think saying that article "saved this sub" is a great leap in logic. Also I don't really believe normies are going to wake up because the media is censoring this. If the media censoring credible info was all it took to wake people up, MSM wouldn't still exist.</p></p>

<p><p>Just for clarity sake, what do you mean by "Having an occult/satanic kind of religion - perfectly fine". Do you mean that speculating about it is fine, or do you mean that important politicians having it is fine? Because if I have to go with the latter, I'll have to say, no, it's not okay. It is not okay at all.</p></p>

<p><p>It's not a crime no, but if you read the books on satanism (They largely tend to be atheists with their own ideals) and learn more about their outlook it brings a very concerning picture into play. They can believe whatever the hell they want if they keep to themselves and don't hurt others, but no way in hell am I ever going to be okay with a politician being one.</p></p>

<p><p>I'd like to focus on the inclusion of children with sperm+blood+breast milk rituals as a "not perfectly fine" topic. I doubt it was <em>exclusively</em> pig blood.</p></p>

<p><p>I don't think we should focus on the handkerchief code first since actual pizza was involved. Show the instagram #chickenlovers and ask other people to explain how a 2 year old boy is eating chicken in the photo, then show the research that indicates what it really means. The instagram photos are the key to pizzagate, with the Sasha Lord birthday party being important. Show the collusion after the shock. Btw, the vimeo got shut down for copyright. </p></p>
