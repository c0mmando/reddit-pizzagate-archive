<strong>I 100% believe pizzagate is real</strong>
<p><p>I'm also about 90% sure comet is involved or at least alefantis is. But it seems like we've hit a snag in the investigation. And We're over focusing on the pizza angle there is no smoking gun so far.Remember FBIanon said follow the money. I think we need to regroup, branch out, recheck the emails. Remember there were 2100 new hidden podesta emails. Also maybe there are hidden Hillary emails too. Maybe if we branch out we will find our smoking gun.</p></p>

<p><p>I asked for help today looking into the PizzaPac - some Political Action Committee to raise mone involving Alefantis and his friends.</p></p>

<p><p>I am sure people are covering their tracks.  Also, these people own law enforcement and the judicial system.  We do not.  Even if we have proof, nothing will be done if law enforcement and the judicial system cover it up.  </p></p>

<p><p>I feel like if you had strong enough evidence it might force the system to notice it, my feeling is that most people are very against child abuse, especially when it's right in their face.</p></p>

<p><p>I am very cynical about it.  I have watched Conspiracy of Silence on youtube.  Also, I know of several cases in which the rich and powerful got away with committing horrible acts.  If they did serve prison time, it was not for very long.  An ordinary person will go away for a long time, but someone with power and connections will go away for only a year or two.  </p>
<p>This does not only apply to child pornography or underage sex.  It also applies to possession of drugs, drug trafficking, etc.  Gary Webb wrote about it extensively regarding the CIA.  So did many others.  There is definitely a double standard when it comes to the criminal justice system.  </p></p>

<p><p>I totally agree with you there, the current system is easily gamed by the rich, and was obviously set up by them for them to do so.</p></p>

<p><p>The emails weren't "hidden" as much as "keyword searches didn't include them as part of the index." Abramovic is a character I'd like to focus on.</p></p>
