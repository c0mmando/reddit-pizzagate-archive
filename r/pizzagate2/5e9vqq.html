<strong>This is our chance to pick up steam! We need a beginner guide/fact sheet for newcomers</strong>
<p><p>This sub is starting to get exposure but it's difficult for people who are unfamiliar to get into it. News sites are directly citing /r/pizzagate which is the perfect platform to get a following. The mods need to make the evidence and timeline accessible and codense (while being elaborate) enough for any new person to see what kind of conspiracy we are dealing with.</p>
<p>I personally think that the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e72zv/on_the_legitimacy_of_this_investigation_with_an/">current self.post on the front page</a> is an excellent start. A scandal of this scale will never catch on with skeptics if we don't present it in a concise manner and connect the dots. I would also suggest that we present the most damning evidence and mails where the pizza references are clearly out of context. The less ambiguous the post is, the more likely people will support the cause.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your hard work. This is a crazy ride and I wish I knew how to help.</p></p>
