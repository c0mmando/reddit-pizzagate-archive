<strong>James Alefantis' business partner Carol Greenwood left Bucks &amp; Comet Pizza - then so did each of the chefs he hired after her.</strong>
<p><p>Carol Greenwood was the chef for both Bucks Fishing and Comet Pizza when they opened - as well as Alefantis' business partner. Someone posted about that already. Said she left to focus on family and other styles of art  ( see <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/food/article/13037971/how-are-bucks-fishing-camping-and-comet-ping-pong-faring">this</a> article ).</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Alefantis subsequently hired two new chefs - one for Comet Pizza (Laura Bonino) and one for Bucks (Vicki Reh). </p>
<p>--</p>
<p>In 2010 Comet Pizza briefly lost its liquor license due to a "filing error" which was when Alefantis revealed to a reporter that Laura Bonino had also left to focus on her other business. ( <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/food/blog/13126759/comet-hopes-to-have-its-liquor-license-back-this-week">see this article</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/food/blog/13126763/comet-ping-pong-gets-its-liquor-license-back-loses-chef">this one</a>.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Separately Vicki Reh also left Bucks in 2013 to study wine <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/going-out-guide/wp/2013/04/11/changes-at-buckss-fishing-camping/">article</a></p>

<p>I understand this could be coincidence, but worth noting anyway.</p></p>

<p><p>Maybe we could try and contact them? Maybe tell them about our investigation; pressure them saying it will come out eventually? But maybe they REALLY don't know and left for the reasons said. Even if that's the case, they may have noticed some weird things when they worked there?</p></p>

<p><p>Check people out quietly and archive all social network activity before making any attempts at contact.</p>
<p>I would advise against contact of any kind at this point.  It would he better to determine who they contact and how often etc before revealing they are being looked at. If/when the case starts getting msm attention, you can bet that most of these people will go dark.</p></p>
