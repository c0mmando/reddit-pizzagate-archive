<blockquote>
<p>SAGE: The next thing that you wanted to do is try to get your message out nationally. Do you recall this? I'm the one that contacted the Christian Broadcast Network and convinced them to put your message on the air... unedited, unreviewed I mean these people were layin' their, their ah, jobs on the line. I'm the one that did that for you the FBI did that for you. Your response in your own words DAVID, IN YOUR OWN WORDS, not my words, not ATF's not the FBI, not anybody that's ever wronged you, your own words where was that as soon as this message is broadcast I WILL IMMEDIATELY and you stressed immediately...</p>
<p>KORESH: Come out...</p>
<p>SAGE: and you did a good job.</p>
<p>KORESH: immediately.</p>
<p>SAGE: Come out immediately.</p>
<p>KORESH: Right.</p>
<p>SAGE: What happened? You...</p>
<p>KORESH: (interrupts) My, my, my commander, my commander,...</p>
<p>SAGE: went back on your own word.</p>
<p>KORESH: my commander and chief told me to wait.</p>
<p>SAGE: Well that's a pretty easy excuse to hide behind.</p>
<p>KORESH: And that's what you all get behind too, isn't it?</p>
<p>SAGE: It is not, we...</p>
<p>KORESH: (interrupts) We (unintelligible) also.</p>
<p>SAGE: (unintelligible) everything we've promised you DAVID</p>
<p>KORESH: Mr. BYRON, I disagree with you... evidence shows in every respect the media to what you've done turnin' our lights off all this shows that you are makin' the same employment that I am.</p>

<p>Just wanted to put this out there. I've been looking for concrete links between Waco-related personalities and the Podesta ring. I believe if a link were to be established, many more people will become interested in the breaking events.</p>
<p>The trouble is, there are so many people involved that things get confusing fast. Just putting this out there in case it can bring anything to the front of anyone's mind w/ more experience and details on the events related to the Branch Davidian incident.</p>
<p>Janet Reno's recent demise, as well as the nature of a compound which seemed to at least somewhat function as a "farm", are interesting coincidences indeed.</p>
<p>However, don't get distracted if you're on a better lead</p></p>
