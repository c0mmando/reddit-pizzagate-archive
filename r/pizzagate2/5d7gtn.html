<strong>Is this related to Pizzagate?</strong>
<p><p>Guys,yesterday I was going through my youtube feed and there was a new video in one of the top Youtube channel(TVF) in india,released on 14 th of November on the birthday of Jawarharlal Nehru,the video shows the challenges faced by the roadside children of India,their poverty and how they are sexually abused without anyone rescuing them.</p>
<p>Here is the link to the video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut4oDmDkvZE</p>
<p>now at the end of the video they presented me with a website http://www.100millionfor100million.org/</p>
<p>its a sign up website,I tried to enter all the details and ended up with a physical address.</p>
<p>RoundGlass</p>
<p>1756 114th Ave SE</p>
<p>Bellevue, WA 98053.</p>
<p>since I have been following r/conspiracy from a long time,I thought something is fishy,so I posted it there but it didn't got much attention,I hope you all will get something out of it.</p></p>

<p><p>I can't watch the video right now.</p>
<p>I haven't heard about any investigations around Seattle or WA (yet). The site (on mobile) looks legit to me.</p>
<p>But if you look into who donates to it, or where it works, and see if it connects at all with anything that has already come up - or any warning signs at all - then stick with it. </p></p>
