<strong>Three step plan for maximum spread...</strong>
<p><p>Hello, </p>
<p>We need to increase our efforts in getting this main stream, and this is the plan to do that. </p>
<p>1) <strong>Data Packets</strong> Lets get create a few info packets on this case organized in a stickied thread. We need to combine the most emeperical evidence, in a palatable manner. This means a few different packets... 1) Intro packet, 2) Deeper insight into different aspects of the case. Clean info graphics would do a lot of good. </p>
<p>One this is organized we....</p>
<p>2) Call and email local news stations. These are your channel 5s etc, that are less likely to be complete shills. Call and email local reporters at these news stations. If you are not American you can still call/email local news. Tell them you are from the area, and explain why this needs to be investigated. Attach info packet. If you are terrible at reply to press please post your email on this sub and we will assist with replies. </p>
<p>3) We should focus 10 different areas/news stations to centralize on each day. These are the places that will get blown up, and will feel a need to respond etc. </p>
<p>We need to get this organized, and spread through various Internet forums. A bot net would be amazing for this. </p>
<p>Let's get organized, and focus on difficult structures to control. As these news stations report we create more awareness, and credibility. Easy to own a national news organization, much more difficult to influence all the local ones. </p></p>
