<p><p>Good catch. The use of a butterfly image as a pedo symbol is not an accident. It clearly refers to Monarch programming, a systematic rape and torture of children in order to create mind-controlled slaves with multiple personalities (or alters, as they call them). Vigilant Citizen has a good article on the subject: http://vigilantcitizen.com/hidden-knowledge/origins-and-techniques-of-monarch-mind-control/</p></p>

<p><p>it looks like you did. I am trying to hard to not believe any of this, looking for every possible problem or gap with all of this information. I am giving everything every benefit of the doubt but it's just stacking up too much. What the hell is going on? Is this really as historic and deep and fucked up as it seems? Am I going mad?</p></p>

<p><p>I've been "awake" for over three years now and none of these revelations really surprise me. What is different here is that we have a real fighting chance to inflict some serious damage on the whole rotten political system, to shake people out of their daily stupor and make them realize that their rulers and idols are nothing but a bunch of sick, perverted monsters.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm at about 3 years as well. 2012 was a toughie for me, and I wasn't even worried about the whole Mayan calendar thing.</p>
<p>One good thing to come of this if nothing else, is a whole lot of awakening. Even Kanye West!</p></p>

<p><p>Definitely keep paying attention to what's unfolding, and keep thinking in the back of your mind about how you could apply your skills, specifically how you did your past analyzing work, to this case.</p>
<p>Since our likelihood of getting justice on this is going to correlate closely with how many people around the country/world we can wake up to the alleged truth, it would be very helpful to have more and more aesthetically clear graphics connecting the dots and displaying the thought process behind the connecting of all the dots, with cited sources.</p>
<p>To clarify, I'm thinking of the 4chan-originated graphics of the giant web connecting all of the potentially implicated characters and the wikileaks, only with a more robust description between each connection of the thought process/analysis that led to making each connection. </p></p>

<p><p>https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Reviews/ChildServ-Reviews-E816422.htm
http://archive.is/Sd5NS</p>
<p>Reviews by former employees of ChildServ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The office conditions were completely horrible, no one should have to be exposed to things of that nature.</p>
<p>Worst management from the top down</p>
<p>For an organization that's been around since the 1800's this organization has no concern for its staff or its image. They chase the funding. The new leadership is too concerned with its former job occupation, getting waited on hand and foot by his staff. The new executive director sets you up to fail with unrealistic goals, ignores advice, walks out of meetings throwing temper tantrums. With a $11+ million dollar budget they cant seem to run the most basic programs for more than a couple hundred participants a year while other organizations with the same programs and a far less budget of $3-5 million dollars seem to be able to service thousands to hundreds of thousands a year. They fire staff who have been there almost 30 years citing no budget and new staff after a couple months and bring in their old staff and steal ideas that were previously presented by other staff.</p>
<p>Poor pay grade, unfair treatment Unorganized and unqualified professionals that hinder clients from achieving full potential.of employees, poor financial management. Employees are not treated with respect and salaried employees clock in for some unknown reason.</p>
<p>A culture of finger pointing, blaming and shaming. Low pay. many employees just don't care. Management out of touch with day to day operations. Management seem preoccupied with power instead of company mission. High turnover which suggests employees are rejecting the unsupportive "throw you under the bus"culture.</p>

<p><p>The CEO Dan Kotowski was the Illinois State Senator from the 18th District, he served January 2007 – October 2015.</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Kotowski</p>
<p>He has his name on some bills involving child trafficking. Does anyone here speak legislativese? The bills seem to be benign but this guy leaves to work for ChilServ which uses a know pedo symbol as its logo and he's dealing with child trafficking laws? It needs more investigation, which I will attempt to do..</p>

<p><p>Here is an additional review of ChildServ from an employee in 2015:</p>
<p>Here is a review of ChildServ per an employee from 2015:</p>
<p>"When I first started with ChildServ it was a an unorganized free for all! However, you go the since the original management that had been there for over ten and fifteen years halfway cared about you, The hours were long, the pay was not comparable with other places and their expectations were way off, There was always a cash flow problem, that they managed to fix at the last minute. There was a lot of bias people there. Most The current management at this place is incompetent to say the least. They are promoting people in higher positions that can't do their current position let along manage people, but it's all political especially with the new management team that they currently have. They have laid off lots of key people and other have resigned due to the current working conditions and management. Be aware that 90% of their management team is new because of political promotions . The turnover at this place is ridiculous. Run the other way because this place is going down hill fast! I'm glad I go out before the ship completely sank.... I am ashamed to have had my name associated with this company."</p>
