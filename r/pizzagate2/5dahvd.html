<strong>What will be the result of this investigation</strong>
<p><p>This is my first post, but I have been following r/DNC leaks, then r/pizzagate for a couple weeks now. It can't be said enough; thank you for the work your doing. 
But I'm curious how everyone thinks this will all go down. I agree we should keep our heads down, research, and make connections. I'm optimistic that too many eyes are opened and this can't be squashed anymore, or do you think that is still a possibility? 
How will we stop this when every arm of government and law is involved? 
And if this is irrefutably proven, do you think it will tear the very fabric of our society apart? It needs to be ripped to shreds, but how will we as a nation react to knowing our government is run by satanic pedophiles? 
I've just been blown away by this and can't help but thinks it's the seeds of an uprising and frightening retaliation... what other scenarios are there? </p></p>

<p><p>An agent within the FBI said that the information cannot be leaked because it would bring down the entire federal government. </p></p>

<p><p>Honestly? </p>
<p>If a few people aren't sued for defamation I'd be fucking shocked. </p>
<p>Outside of that? Nothing. </p></p>

<p><p>At this point it looks like it's so entangled the best chance of it even getting prosecuted is for the public to demand it. </p></p>

<p><p>Nothing. This subreddit has been overrun by crazies. Satan, mind control, god, aliens, blood rituals, nuclear war and everything you could possibly make up has been brought up here. A honest investigation with a clear head does not happen here.<br/>
People see somewhere a picture of a pizza (one of the most famous foods around) and post it "URGENT EVERYONE INVESTIGATE THIS I FOUND A PIZZA".</p>
<p>This place makes it impossible to follow actual leads when you have to walk through so much bullshit of crazy theories.</p></p>

<p><p>Very interesting that you post so much in this sub if you think it's all just crazy. </p>
<p>Do you have a certain kind of... let's say secret little hobby... that you need to stop people from looking into so much? Or is there perhaps certain kind of people you need to protect from getting exposed?</p>
<p>Do tell....</p></p>

<p><p>We already know reddit is crawling with CTR shills paid by two times loser pant suit and her pedo friends. End of story.</p>
<p>And since you obviously are trying very, very hard to mock and discourage the people who are doing their best to expose evil fuckwits abusing - and killing - children, OF COURSE that makes me wonder what exactly your motives are...</p>
<p>So what are you motives? You didn't answer my question. </p></p>

<p><p>Google "Correct the Record", "Hillary Clinton campaign" and "David Brock". If you need more info than that to figure things out, then there is nobody on this planet who can help you. </p>
<p>And you are absolutely disrupting and mocking people in this sub. Just stay the hell away if you find it all just "crazy". There is ZERO reason for you to troll around here unless you want to protect pedos. Bye.  </p></p>
