<strong>Marina Abramovic on Right-Wing Attacks: ‘It’s Absolutely Outrageous and Ridiculous</strong>
<p><blockquote>
<p>“It was just a normal dinner,” Abramovic said, adding that about 10 people attended. “It was actually just a normal menu, which I call spirit cooking. There was no blood, no anything else. We just call things funny names, that’s all.” (The Kickstarter page advertised “traditional soups.”)</p>
<p>Spirit Cooking, Abramovic explained, was a performance she staged at a number of museums around the world in the ‘90s, painting graffiti with pigs’ blood. She also made a limited-edition book, which contains various recipes. That book is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, among other places.

</blockquote>
<p>From the kickstarter page</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pledge $10,000</p>
<p>[LIVE EVENT / THE EXERCISES: SPIRIT COOKING WITH MARINA ABRAMOVIC] A dinner night with Marina during which she will teach you and other backers at this level how to cook a series of traditional soups, which you will all enjoy together. The night will end with the making of a golden ball, a recipe given to Marina in a Tibetan monastery. Marina will bring to this dinner a Spirit Cooking memento for each backer to keep. PLUS MAI and OMA office tour, Neuroscience Exclusives, OMA / MAI Digital Design Package, Complete Abramovic Method Exclusives, access to ALL $25 live stream exercises / live events, MAI 101 Lecture and Digital Booklet, MAI Founder (CHAMBER FOUNDER), Digital MAI rewards, and The Embrace rewards.

</blockquote>
<p>Some of the Backers on kickstart said they did not receive anything. I really think they are using art to launder money. Lady Gaga and Jay-Z supported the kickstart project btw.</p></p>

<p><p>Of course it is propaganda. However, it is important to note that many of the main players in PizzaGate are now aware of the investigation.</p></p>

<p><p>When you watch Polanski movies from the standpoint of him being a high ranking satanist, his satanic leaders characters make a lot of sense. They deny deny deny, and say the same thing he says in real life: "I have no knowledge nor interest in the occult", etc. I'm picking up this quote from The Ninth Gate.</p>
<p>Marina is doing textbook satanic PR.</p></p>

<p><p>think about this - Polanski exposes this shit in Rosemarys baby </p>
<p>Manson and mind controlled satanic cult are sent by the elite pedo ring in hollywood to kill him in retaliation under the guise of a "race war"</p>
<p>makes total sense ... just my theory </p>
<p>curious what you know...</p></p>

<p><p>I don't know anything really, especially about Sharon Tate's murder. But I don't buy the official sob story since I realized he's a high ranking ghoul. There are many more typical, classical narratives such a murder fits neatly under when you take that into account.</p></p>

<p><p>I like how her book came out 3 weeks after all this happened. Wonder how much it cost to fake a book that fast. Lorum ipsum </p></p>

<p><p>Abromovic and her ilk still assume the public is dumb enough to believe such bullshit about "it's a right wing conspiracy theory." An assumption they make at their own peril. </p>
<p>They are completely out of touch. </p></p>

<p><p>Not so much as out of touch as desperate, I think. We are getting closer than ever. Beware false trails- those may cost us valuable time, in which the real trail has gone cold.</p>
<p>We need to get as many eyes on this as possible. The more eyes, the bigger it gets, the more likely they are to panic and slip up.</p></p>

<p><p>WAS a Democrat my whole life - this is not a conspiracy, we aren't just making all this up just because the "election is making us crazy"</p>
<p>If this was a just political attack on them, then wouldn't it have stopped once Trump won?</p></p>
