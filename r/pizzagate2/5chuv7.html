<p><p>www.elkinsmedia.com takes you to an "Index of /" page with two files, "favicon.gif" and "favicon.ico". I attempted to open both, but they were unopenable. Downloaded them, and they're both 0 bytes in size. Not gonna risk trying to open them.</p></p>

<p><p>The email is a fishing attempt, not the screenshot ;) Probably to expose your ip or an browser exploit to infect your workstation.</p></p>
