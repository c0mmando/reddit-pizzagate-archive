<strong>weird article about Pizza searches on p0r|\|site</strong>
<p><p>I looking for Pizza related articales on google search and accidentally found this article:
http://metr(DELETE-THIS-FROM-LINK)o.co.uk/2016/10/27/people-are-watching-loads-of-pizza-themed-porn-this-year-6218187/
 just read the article and went like WTF??? why would so many people search for pr0n with pizza? I can understand searching for particular body type or action but Pizza? One of popular searches there are "Pizza big sausage", "Pizza girl"  - what de fu&lt;K? it may very well be though that after Pizza scandal went viral, some folks with dirty mind started searching for Pizza related p0rn in hope to find what these perverts secretly desire.
Also if you look at the bottom of the article there is a strange poll panel colored pink which asks "which is sexier Sex Or Pizza"? what the hell? is site is suspicious to me. what if it is somehow a beacon for pedos? it has a contact page where you can, as they say, submit info and stuff... very suspicious.</p>
<p>Also, there is one very sick youtube channel which references both Sexy pizza and children:

warning: i have modified the links to prevent backtracking. copy link, paste it, and then subtract "(DELETE-THIS)" from link.</p></p>

<p><p>Have you never seen a porn? Like, a girl gets pizza delivered and seduces the pizza guy, it's like cannon in porno plots. Also, there are quite a few cam girl exhibitionist shows who actually do a version of this IRL for tips, but mostly no touching.
Wouldn't worry about it.</p></p>
