<p><p>"Cannibal" original came from "cana baal" or priest of baal, because the priests of baal used to eat their victims too - this is the molech stuff again. "Kohen or cohen (or kohain; Hebrew: כֹּהֵן, "priest", pl. כֹּהֲנִים kohanim) is the Hebrew word for priest used colloquially in reference to the Aaronic ... " Answer (1 of 3): There is a lot of variations of the name Cohen, which means priest. * English: Cohen, Cowen, Cahn, Cahan, Carne, Cohn, Cone, Conn, Conway, Cohan ... Thus we have the word, cannibal, which comes from Cahan-Bal priest of Baal. </p></p>

<p><p>I also brought it up. There is a Podesta email saying he has an outdoor pizza oven at his house. Comet pizza has one and so does Roberta's, the other pizza place where the clintons celebrated a birthday of a close friend.</p></p>

<p><p>The article said that Podesta's oven puts out 200 pizzas.  That's one large pizza oven/crematorium.  I wonder if his looks like Molech.</p></p>

<p><p>Yea, they are trying to again.  But spirit cooking is what went viral that caused pizzagate, so it isn't going to work.</p>
<p>Did you see the word "cannibal" is from the hebrew for "priests of baal" thread?  same sort of thing going on there.</p></p>

<p>That would be an amazing pizza oven though. lol, especially if you could make the cheese... fuck, I feel like I can't talk about pizza anymore.</p>
<p>Fuck everything related to this situation. Even all that time I spent on Monarch so that this shit isn't phasing me yet. Yeah yeah... heard all of this before...</p>

<p><p>One should also notice that the sign for Comet Ping Pong resembles  the body of the Unicrusal Hexagram one of the holy symbols of Thelema, the system of Magik created by Allister Crowley.  I won't say all the people involved in pizzagate are Thelemic, but John Podesta certainly is.  See the picture with the 14 and fish drawn on his hands....</p></p>

<p><p>The worship of Moloch (with early roots tied to the Ammonites) was common during the 13th-5th century B.C.. It was practiced in large part by the Canaanites, Phoenicians (which most likely had Judaic roots as a people from the tribe of Asher) and other related cultures in North Africa and the lands of the Levant as far as the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers. The name, Moloch, is a Semitic term that derives its root meaning from the word, ‘king.’ As a god, Moloch was part of cult worship which revolved around a kind of propitiatory child sacrifice system where the children were offered by the parents themselves in a honour ceremony to the god. This kind of sacrifice was void of any edged knives or weapons, but instead gave homage to fire which was connected with Moloch. </p></p>

<p><p>Good catch! I've seen this image before and never connected it with a pizza oven... but I do now. </p>
<p>Funny thing is that I was doing keyword searches with 'Airbnb' and 'pizza' and I found quite a few ads for places with their own pizza oven, but I saw no other symbols or numbers that would raise a second or third red flag, so I abandoned the thought. The only other place I found was an Airbnb rental that was based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and had a rather odd calendar on the wall that looked like adult men posing. </p></p>

<p><p>It was drawn in 1850 if I'm not mistaken, and is all over the web.  And yes, this idol to Molech did have an oven for human sacrifice.</p></p>

<p><p>Fair point then.</p>
<p>But still - Do you think they chose the euphemism of pizza based off the fact that moloch might look a bit like a pizza oven?  Isn't that stretching it a bit?</p></p>

<p><p>No, I find it an ironic fact.  "C"heese "P"izza is "C"hild "P"orn, but these people have shown a wealth of throwing it in your face "funnies", so I'm sure they are aware it looks like a pizza oven too.  In fact, it might have inspired them to get into the business, as they were probably occultic before they started it.</p>
<p>But, I've seen no description to how Baal worshipers ate their sacrifices. <br/>
Maybe it was pizza.</p></p>
