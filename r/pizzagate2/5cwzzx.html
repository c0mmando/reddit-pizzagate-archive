<strong>$. 02 from someone who has been researching this for 20 years... If you guys want to do this right, I would suggest learning A LOT more about the occult (more opinion inside)</strong>
<p><p>Especially how it pertains to this group . There are numerous researchers who have spent their lifetimes on this (none of this is new) . I'll name drop Jordan Maxwell, Michael Tsarion, and Mark Passio to get you started.
Basically the word occult just means hidden or secret knowledge. There is nothing inherently evil about the occult. By and large occult knowledge is nothing but a symbolic framework for how consciousness works and how it relates to the bigger reality. Astrology, tarot, qabalah, this stuff is very real and the elites are into this stuff BIG TIME . That's why these things are portrayed as silly or only seen as tools of divination to predict the future or other such nonsense. It's to keep folks off the trail. There are many systems that fall under the "occult"  umbrella so to speak and I repeat it is not inherently evil . VERY FEW occult groups are interested in the subjugation of others! The occult is a tool and can be used to take you up, or to hold others down. Most folks who are into this stuff use it to become better more refined versions of themselves (just check out /r/occult, it's a really great subreddit although conspiracy is not their favorite topic) . Take the practice of alchemy for example. No, it's not literally about turning base metal into gold, that was all symbolic code speak to avoid persecution from the church for practicing a different "religion". It's about refining your base personality into the purest form of yourself. This intimate knowledge of how our psychology works is how they maintain power. They know us better than we know ourselves. Mainly because through the mass media they have carefully crafted and created what we literally are. For you aren't really anything but the story that you tell yourself. Never forget you have a conscious choice on what that story can be! So check Jordan Maxwell to learn about all the symbols. Symbols on the money on the flags, the seals, the department logos, the government buildings, everything and everywhere you look that has to do with government has occult symbolism. Most people are just symbol illiterate. Check out Michael Tsarion for all the historical connections of all the families involved. He's got it mapped out and traced back to at least Charlemagne in the 1200s! And Mark Passio (former member of church of Satan who saw the light) he'll break down the personal psychology stuff as good as anyone. Keep it up guys! This is really exciting! It's Happening!</p></p>

<p><p>Just 30 short days ago, I would have never believed how much symbolism means to these people.  Now I am a believer.</p>
<p>Has anyone else considered that the pedosatanist's infatuation with symbolism resulted in the rise of Pepe?  They took the white supremacist subversive symbol bait like a fat kid on a cookie.</p></p>

<p><p>It doesn't derive from white supremacist really. It derives from the Egyptian pantheon.

<p><p>Kek relating to Pepe is usually "top kek".</p>
<p>4chan term for "very funny" because kek is what alliance players in world of warcraft saw when horde players said "lol".</p>
<p>So it's just "top lol".</p>
<p>It's a coincidence that there is a kek mythology. Upon that discovery everyone started saying praise kek and such.</p></p>

<p><p>I don't know if i think its coincidence or not. Memetic stuff is often trickled down into society from sources that mean to introduce a concept to people subtlety so i wonder how true the origin story is since i'm sure most weren't there for its first use.</p></p>

<p><p>The more I think about it, you guys might want to start realizing how old and intertwined this network is. These are the descendants of the European royal families. Their bloodlines are all easily verifiable. There are supposedly 13 bloodlines. These families are the rulers of this planet and some believe it goes back to ancient Egypt with the solar cults. Google it up. Obama and Dick Cheney are 8th cousins. Obama and Bush are 12th cousins. Trump and Hillary are 13th cousins. You can't make this shit up people! Every presidential election up until I believe the Bush Kerry election was won by the most royal of the  bloods. These are literally the people that invented the institutions and governments of which they head. It's all by design, and it goes WAY back . Keep looking! Its all in the symbology! </p></p>

<p><p>Yup they write these tongue in cheek "who da thunk that" articles every 4 years mentioning it. It is actually apparently not their style to lie to us. They hide the truth in plain sight in movies, TV, and video games so when someone tries to reveal anything it just sounds like they've been watching too much TV. It works pretty good. I used to get comments about watching too much X files all the time back in the day when I would try to tell people about this. </p></p>

<p><p>I think we're more interested in what resources already exist in the OP's mind that cover the material. It's not as simple as looking up a word in the dictionary where there are 300 books with identical conclusions and language. It's more the hope we can leverage some of the other person's perspective to find the best starting point from their eyes. If it really is just 'Googling it' I tend to doubt the depth they've gone through with the subject themselves and it's discouraging, but I'll still look into it since I'm interested.</p></p>

<p><p>no! it's not all in the symbology. we need evidence! going down your path 1000 years into history is a huge distraction at this point. right now, we contemporary names, dates, places, numbers. we already have enough hermeneutical data to go on.</p></p>

<p><p>STFU, occult can go to hell. We should be investigating silicon valley partners and fucking Brock. The guy is really in charge and has huge ties to the Bitcoin market.</p>
<p>I'm starting to think that Bitcoin is only here today because this guys wanted to trade their shit in the black market without wiring bank accounts.</p></p>

<p><p>People should stop with this occult, it is not the focus. The focus is the children. We don't care about WHY they are doing, we want them to STOP WHAT they are doing and we should focus on the already prosecuted individuals who are involved.</p>
<p>BTW: thank you for your compilation. You done it by yourself? Would you lead me to where you got it? I really want to focus on this monster in the form of a person who must have founding/funding Bitcoin with the sole purpose of operating in the shadows.</p></p>

<p><p>I've been doing lots of research, is a big part of the occult that they understand the concept of "linear" time to be imaginary? Seems like they use the mass misconception of time to their advantage as one of their main weapons.</p></p>

<p><p>Hmm it's all pretty much inferred from personal observation lol, I'll see if I can find any writeups that align with what I'm trying to say. For the spiritual side https://www.espavo.org/beacons/ has been on-point about everything so far. The awakening is essentially us transforming from 3-dimensional beings to 5-dimensional beings and having control over time/space like we've never experienced before. </p>
<p>You're definitely right about the office plan, our perception of time and space is super fucked right now. I'll see if I can find a good writeup that explains the linear time thing some more.</p></p>

<p><p>Basic occult knowledge is a must for anyone seriously invested in researching conspiracies (<em>any</em> conspiracy, not just the pedo stuff). It doesn't matter whether <em>you</em> believe it's real. What matters is that <em>they</em> believe it's real, and having this knowledge gives great insight into their motivations and processes.</p>
<p>I suggest starting with Manly P. Hall's <a href="https://removetheveildotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/secret-teachings-of-all-ages.pdf">The Secret Teachings of All Ages</a> (link goes to a free .pdf copy). It's a basic overview of the symbolism and ideas they believe in.</p></p>

<p><p>The Secret Teachings of All Ages was a real eye-opener. I stumbled across it a few years ago and still come back to it just to recall certain topics. It goes really deep and I spent a lot of time trying to understand some of the things in the book. I cannot recommend it enough, if you want to learn about the occult. </p></p>

<p><p>This is a great post!</p>
<p>Harry Potter - a giant franchise about secret group of good and evil wizards who are fighting over control, while muggles remain ignorant of their existence.    </p>
<p>While I hope this muggle awakening is the real deal - I fear that this is just more of "revelation of the method."  I think memes are a new kind of magic that we are seeing utilized.  And you see that people who are using it are seeing that it's working and are joking about it being magic.  Once they realize that they ARE practicing magic and go from accidental users to adepts, we are gonna have a whole lot more white wizards on our hands.  </p></p>

<p><p>Most people just don't realize what "magic" is. Remember it wasn't that long ago that the masses were illiterate. Just to be able to read and write and the things you can get done and learn from that one skill would have seemed magical to millions. Ever notice to cast a spell... And to spell a word, use the same word "spell". </p></p>

<p><p>Hermetism. Esoterism. Mysticism. Theosophy. Astrology. Alchemy. New Age. Magick. Luciferianism. </p>
<p>Call it what you will, all these Gnosticisms are what the etymology indicates: a cult of knowledge. </p>
<p><strong>Mindgame</strong>: imagine the choice was entirely mandatory. Either I kill you, or I kill 100 million random children in Europe and the USA. Whatever you do, nobody will ever know about it. You are sure about it, as you are sure I am not bluffing. What do you choose?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you answer "I don't give a fuck, let the 100 million die, nobody will ever know, why do I care", you belong to category 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you answer "I could never live with that on my conscience - actually, I prefer to live in conscience than to live - I prefer to be blamed for doing the right thing than be praised for doing evil things, I'll save the children", you belong to category 2.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Category 1: you are driven by a reptilian instinct of survival. Your worldview is that we are evolved meat that produce only waste and CO2. After we die, nothing lasts, and nobody gives a fuck. You want to control, to know, to own. You want to improve your "level", "strength", "perception", whatever. You suffer from the symptom of having all possible comforts yet not finding peace, self-realization. You don't see who you are in reality. The occult could be a very good way to augment your condition, and to meet like-minded people.</p>
<p>Category 2: welcome to the majority of humanity. You have a working pre-frontal cortex. You also don't believe consciousness, dreams, intuition and love are the mere byproduct of synapses, chemical reactions and primitive instincts. You know every conscious human being is a creator in his own right. You understand the beauty of symphonies and innocence. You are self-aware. You would be disgusted by the so-called "occult". Investigate it but see it for what it is: the neurosis of deeply troubled and unhappy people. </p></p>

<p><p>I agree that it's a personality / spirituality disorder. Which is why the rich and famous and celebrities and the like are so predisposed to it.  Literally having everything,  fame, fortune, sex, power, and still being unfulfilled, clearly leaves these people with a whole host of issues.</p></p>

<p><p>Sorry, but you're wrong. </p>
<p>For example, throwing acid in a little girl's face to punish her for going to school is wrong, regardless of what anyone thinks. Even if no one knows, or thinks anything about it, it is still wrong. This is true everywhere in the Universe and at any time. It typically does not depend upon one's culture. Or rather, if you culture practices it, your culture is wrong. The wrongness of initiating violence against defenseless innocents is absolute, it exists in nature. We can regret it, we can however not deny it.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, all small children recognize injustice before they know the word, and much before they intellectually grasp the concept. Therefore, the "substance" of injustice exists in nature, regardless of our relative perception of it. Our brain does not <em>produce</em> the notion of injustice, it merely <em>decodes</em> it from reality as best it can. </p>
<p>It can similarly be proven that Beauty exists. Truth exists. These are natural (and thus absolute) notions. For example, a fresh camel turd is objectively less beautiful than a blooming rose, it is not a matter of relative opinion, if you think otherwise you're wrong (and sick).</p>
<p>Think of Pi, which exists in nature. Even before people started describing it, it already existed. So it exists absolutely - we cannot explain it, we can only observe it however imperfectly; indeed it is impossible to fully grasp/describe it because it is an irrational number. Similarly other absolutes cannot necessarily be grasped by the mind - we know however they exist, and we can try to best tend towards (approximate) them.</p></p>

<p><p>This is strongly suggested by the documents attached in this, one of the more viral emails from the Global Intelligence Files, sent by one of several genetic.crime.mappingXXXX[at]domain[dot]com email accounts.</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/53/531436_news-u-won-t-find-in-the-news-.html</p>
<p>[Edit: This stuff is also suggested in the documents in the <a href="http://file.wikileaks.org/file">Wikileaks file directory</a>. Lots of handbooks for ritual activities of frats, freemasons; info on Scientology, some buddhist cult...] After having dug through a lot of those and documentaries/interviews/podcasts on the Larry King case &amp; Boystown, I can see (but am only beginning to understand) how convoluted and insane everything is. </p>
<p>I think I was very naïve when all the centipedes from /r/the_donald and all the autists on 4ch and 8ch were seeing this stuff for the first time and I/we were thinking it would lead to justice. Sort of demoralizing; however we live in a different world now.</p></p>

<p><p>See my comment above about the world view / cosmogony of all these "enlightened" philosophies, such as the one Freemasonry espouses. Do you understand this?</p>
<p>If so, how best would you contradict what I'm saying? Do you agree you place knowledge as the highest merit, i.e. that you practice a cult of knowledge? </p>
<p>Also, could you tell me who you think you are? (not as in John Smith, lawyer, but rather WHO are YOU, existentially?)</p></p>

<p><p>There is two kinds of masons, those who respect the master Mason  (universe/god) and those who want to be the master mason. Secret societies and occult are simply organizations to pass down knowledge. How one uses that knowledge is up to their free will. Some simply bear witness some wish to be what is witnessed.</p></p>

<p><p>Freemasonry is, above all else, a fraternity of brotherly bond. Many are drawn to it for different reasons, such as craving knowledge, companionship, helping others in their community, or just the free meal and guy-time every week. If I had to describe the goal of the fraternity in a single sentence, I would say that Freemasonry exists to help good men become better men and grow closer to whatever god(s) that man believes in by learning how to act morally, control desires (alcoholism, consumerism, remaining faithful to their partner, etc.), be compassionate for those around them, and volunteering time for the community. Those who do choose to pursue a path of enlightenment and knowledge would go through their state's Academy of Masonic Knowledge to become a Masonic Scholar. For more information, you can check out your state's Freemasonry website where they will likely list all of the books and study materials that a brother must master to achieve the rank of Masonic Scholar. For more symbolic and esoteric reading, I strongly recommend P. F. Hall's publications. Your local public library likely has several of his books.   </p>
<p>Also, I wanted to mention that no man involved in the disgusting behavior uncovered in Pizzagate could call himself a Freemason. If he has ties to a lodge, they would be permanently severed if knowledge of such actions ever came to light. A brother would never protect or conceal such behavior.</p>
<p>As far as who I am in my present form, I am a builder, daily studying intellectual pursuits to broaden my mind and improve creativity while living with an open, loving, accepting, and helpful mindset. I've seen the incredible work that this Fraternity can accomplish (research Shriner hospitals and Masonic charities) while asking nothing in return, and it's truly inspiring to be around men of such great character.   </p>
<p>All of that being said, Freemasons are pretty passionate about symbolism. Having studied symbolism quite extensively, I believe I'm in a unique position to assist with deciphering symbols uncovered during the Pizzagate investigations.   </p>
<p>I do hope this helps, and I apologize for the poor writing as it is quite late where I'm located. Also wanted to mention that Reddit has a wonderful /r/Freemasonry subreddit community that is friendly and helpful for any persons - masons or nonmasons - who are curious about the organization.   </p>
<p>tl;dr Freemasons aren't involved in pizzagate as it goes against all of their teachings and beliefs. Some Freemasons are driven to soak up as much information as possible, while some just want free ice cream and companionship. Also I'm a nerd for symbols.</p></p>

<p><p>Excellent post.  I did not know that Michael Tsarion talked about the historical connections.  Do you have a link to any of that? Specifically the historical connections?</p>
<p>I've been reading Richard Farrell's work about the origins of money, starting in Babylonia through Venice.  Interesting stuff, but I'd like to know more of WHO is involved at this point.  It's obvious (to me anyway) that these occultists migrated from Babylon/Phoenicia to Rome, then Venice, then London and Holland. But who they are is still a mystery to me...I know of the 13 families, but that's too vague to have meaning for me.</p></p>

<p><p>If I recall most of Tsarions stuff cites a researcher named Fritz Springmeier. Tsarion has a LOT of videos out. In his 40 hour multi DVD set Origins and Oracles he has a whole DVD related to the who's who stuff. A whole DVD about symbols. I watched all this stuff like 10 years ago off of pirate bay. So I don't remember specific links and stuff. I just wanted to point out that the info on this is definitely out there. </p></p>

<p><p>I would highly recommend watching Truthiracy on Youtube. The researcher is named Christopher Lord and he has done some incredible research on the occult. Seriously mind blowing. </p>
