<strong>To all of you, especially the ones who are struggling with this unveiling</strong>
<p><p>Hello in there, and THANK YOU ALL for your part in the Great Work of shining a light on the ten thousand faces of the Adversary, and in particular this penultimate darkness. </p>
<p>I have been lurking and following the dots since #spiritcooking rose to top trend on Twitter before being scrubbed away. I've bounced between the chans and the subs here, watching them take turns being choked and catch up. I've heard of folks taking to the streets and going dark. I pray for them.</p>
<p>I've seen crowds of new folk come in slack-jawed at the horror and scope of it all. They may not always bring new info but the numbers are encouraging. The hashtags are being squashed on social media, so Twitter and FB seem typically useless, but the YouTube presence expands daily. InfoWars cashed in which will at least send more of the curious to these parts.</p>
<p>Instagram accounts are being sanitized and privatized. The accused are calling in favors and revving up the spin machine for damage control. Trolls and shills are their backup singers in the threads. "It's just art, guys. You sound crazy." I suppose The 120 Days of Sodom is "just a book," then.</p>
<p>Nobody who is paying attention is surprised at corruption in D.C. and other webs of power, but what is suggested by #pizzagate goes beyond corruption into the putrefaction of the human soul. We've been mercifully spared a direct look, but even so it's all too much. Even in these early stages without seeing the damning evidence which surely exists, the implications we can draw from what is being carelessly left by the foolish or flaunted for a thrill by the proud, we are seeing the shapes of the Wendigo Class at last after lifetimes of rumors of their existence.</p>
<p>My username means the exhaustion that comes with unveiling hidden truths, and you are all no doubt suffering apocalypse fatigue yourselves. Let me offer you some simple advice to help your journey.</p>
<p>Honor your body. It is the vehicle of all your work and we are all too quick to take it for granted. The mind requires the healthy brain, and the brain requires certain things of the body to work. </p>
<p>Drink water. Sounds simple, but many of you may be drinking lots of coffee to dig and lots of booze to forget. Both rob you of water. Hydrate and replenish electrolytes. Take magnesium if you can, as it calms the nervous system.</p>
<p>You are what you eat, so eat as well as you're able. Whole foods (meaning fruit/veg/grain/nuts etc rather than processed, not the chain store) will deliver the purest and most sustaining energy. Keep up with your omegas and zinc. </p>
<p>Have a walk around the block as often as you can. Fresh air, natural light, blood flow, and stimulus unrelated to the mystery that plagues your mind will all recharge you. Paradoxically, to serve the people who cannot leave these situations, we must give ourselves a break between digs to stay fresh and useful. The Wendigo depend on burnout and collapse in those who would expose them.</p>
<p>This will seem hardest: get enough sleep. Balance the nightmare fuel with something light, even funny before bed. Meditate if you can to reset the mind and prepare it for rest. White noise, or streaming calm music will help. Soma FM is full of useful material for this and runs 24/7. I recommend the "Drone Zone" station.</p>
<p>Take time to express all that is building inside you. Keep posting but also, make art. For yourself, as a release valve. Transmute the poison, or just drain it off.</p>
<p>When you are overwhelmed, that is the moment to show yourself love immediately and do what must be done to ground yourself. Explore meditation, yoga, or benign magick if you're so inclined (banishing rituals are a great idea). Get the shadow out where you can see it. Fill the space it leaves with light.</p>
<p>To quote another hoping to inspire those who fight darkness, "Do not lose heart. We were made for these times."</p>
<p>This is it. Don't give up. Thank you all.</p></p>

<p><p>I know what you mean about apocalypse fatigue, 
my friends and family say that this has taken over me but I can't help it, I keep thinking of all of those helpless innocent kids. </p>
<p>I hope all of this is a learning curve for humanity and even though we must face true evil I hope in some way we all come out of this all together and make the world a better place..</p>
<p>Unless these fuckers have a killswitch and they take us all down with them.</p></p>

<p><p>I'd like to chop these child molesters into pieces but at this point too much of their organization is anonymous and protected by a web of deceit. I never burn out personally but thanks for the advice seems sound enough.  I drink plenty of water myself but right now being able to reach out and put the touch on these bastards would be much more refreshing .</p></p>

<p><p>Thank you, oh wise one. I'm amazed at all the thankless sleuthing that has been going on. It's easy to forget to take care of yourself even without earth shattering news.</p></p>

<p><p>It's funny you guys are driving yourselves crazy "investigating" crimes that you have no reason to believe even occurred. </p>
<p>Think about that for a second: There is literally no reason to believe that any kids have been molested at or related to Comet Pizza. No unsolved crimes, no missing kids, no rash of kids needing therapy, nothing. You are going nuts trying to solve a crime when there is zero reason to believe that any crime has occurred. </p></p>

<p><p>Even if nothing worse than bad art is happening at Comet Ping Pong, the kids disappearing every 40 seconds aren't going to Narnia. Disrupting the greater phenomena is the goal, obviously. </p></p>
