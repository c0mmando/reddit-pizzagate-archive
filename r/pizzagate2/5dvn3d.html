<strong>Roy Cohn (Trump's mentor) told NYPD Det. James Rothstein he was part of a rather elaborate sexual blackmail operation that compromised politicians with child prostitutes. How long did Trump know?</strong>
<p><p>archived link</p>
<p>http://archive.is/y5AIY</p>
<p>googled Roy Cohn - checks out as someone close to Trump</p>
<p>If he did tell Trump about this stuff, could it potentially explain the following pic? NB i haven't seen enough pics of Ivanka as a child but it would be a chilling thing to think about...</p>
<p>http://archive.is/JGJMZ</p>
<p>googled Detective James Rothstein - checks out as someone involved in fighting child trafficking etc.</p>
<p>what i found weird was during my searches i could access this site from google:</p>
<p>Retired NYPD detective continues to combat human trafficking in rural ...
dairylandpeach.com/.../retired-nypd-detective-continues-to-combat-human-traffickin...
13 Mar 2016 - James Rothstein returned to his hometown, St. Martin, to continue to combat human trafficking of boys and girls in rural areas. By Sheila McCoy ..</p>
<p>i had this message:</p>

<p>Your access to this service has been temporarily limited. Please try again in a few minutes. (HTTP response code 503)</p>
<p>Reason: Access from your area has been temporarily limited for security reasons.</p>
<p>Bit weird. Heres the link:</p>
<p>http://dairylandpeach.com/2016/03/13/retired-nypd-detective-continues-to-combat-human-trafficking-in-rural-minnesota/</p>
<p>Anyway, again perhaps a legit person for someone to reach out to? make them aware of Pizzagate &amp; its influence? </p></p>

<p><p>Goddamnit- I've been praying that Trump knows a lot more about all of this shit than we think he does, and that he is actually ten steps ahead.  For some time, Ive been slightly worried that Trump may have a dark secret that we dont know about; but if this were the case, I feel like hillary would have blown him up by now.  I see trump as almost like this Jesus figure (relatively speaking) in this whole debacle.  Im just praying that he is assembling a team and harnessing the might of the USA to bring down, what could be, a global conspiracy</p></p>

<p><p>Lol. How can Hillary blow up Trump for something she is also doing? Do you not understand what <strong>blackmail</strong> ring means?</p>
<p>It's coupled with CIA drug trafficking. If you want in the mafia-polito-gang you gotta fuck, kill, and eat  kids. You get extraordinary amounts of power and money from the wealthiest people in our world and their quasi-military CIA network, all in exchange for insuring they have damning evidence of child abuse, murder, and even cannibalism in case you diverge from their vision. It's why Hillary asks what her "penance" is (and why she doesn't diverge from their vision). It's no fucking different than the murder initiations in the Sinaloa cartel or the Italian mafia. Our politicians are actually puppets, who happen to eat babies.</p>
<p>The only variation is this organization happens to rule the world, unlike the Sinaloa or Italians.</p>
<p>Humans are predictable and their behavior fractalizes. This doesn't surprise me. I was red pilled with 9/11 years ago.</p></p>

<p><p>Check the list of people that didn't show up to work in buildings 1 and 2. Many openly admitted to being told by someone not to show up to work.</p>
<p>That alone proves that people knew it would happen.</p></p>

<p><p>It was the first day of school, I believe many parents were dropping their kids off at work, and that made them late to work, so they weren't in the building when the planes hit, then didn't show up to work.</p></p>

<p><p>That is the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard. Obviously you didn't look at the list. They weren't dropping anyone off.</p>
<p>I said look at the list. I.E. check the names. They were obviously fucking told not to go to work, many even admit it. To brush that off is asinine.</p>
<p>9/11 was not a terrorist attack committed with box cutters using oil money.</p></p>

<p><p>There is a clear systematic bias against Trump - I could picture a scenario where they expose Trump and he gets tossed to the wayside.  Its just a fear theory, thats all.  I didnt exactly think it through</p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rothstein said that for the 12 years he worked undercover, one issue he continued to run into was different government agencies giving him the runaround or right out blocking him from doing his job. Many prominent figures stood to be compromised for using sexual services from prostitutes. Some, he said, were even into pedophilia.</p>
