<p><p>yea... he loaned the villa to the podesta brothers and they were in the country at the time of the disappearance .. but someone at the resort had to be involved.. how else would that kid go missing with the parents 100 ft away.. I'm going on the assumption that the podesta brothers were involved because of the police sketches</p></p>

<p><p>I just don't believe that Scotland yard or the investigators in Portugal didn't make the connection of who was at the villa during the time Madeleine went missing... I'm looking to get a list of employees of the resort at the time of the kidnapping because if there is a crack in this case to break it open it will be who ever was at the resort that alerted the podestas to the kids being alone</p></p>

<p><p>dr freud came up with his "suduction theory" when he couldn't face his abuse by his own father.</p></p>

<p><p>Something smells fishy here.  Perhaps he revelled in the discomfort and distress of the parents who just lost a child.  Perhaps he wanted to be close to the parents to see if they were close to figuring out what happened to their daughter.  </p></p>
