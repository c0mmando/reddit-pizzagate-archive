<strong>DONT DOX OPENLY ON REDDIT</strong>
<p><p>Its against reddit rules, causes subreddit closures, petty arguments over shadowbans, and pisses off the people being dox'd, which will stop this conspiracy theory gaining traction should it turn out to be legit </p>
<p>Other than that keep up the good work, there's a LOT to be done before this should be handed to FBI but i guess some people have already done that :/ some of the things further down the rabbit hole has completely blown my mind</p></p>

<p><p>Why are people still trusting the FBI ( honeypot )? Every govt organization is involved at some level or is aware of this and has been for decades.</p></p>

<p><p>If you trust FBIanon, there are trustworthy agents in the FBI. Even if you don't think he's legit, there is reason to believe that there are factions within the FBI who are ready to support an investigation.</p></p>

<p><p>They can get the info here/4chan/8chan.  We are having to do the work for them.  Even if the good people inside want to expose it they are probably scared.  They need the publicity and so do we.</p></p>

<p><p>If this isn't in the guidelines post, I'll make sure it gets added when the poster wakes up. If this gets any upvotes I'm going to lock it. Nothing personal. In the future just message the mods and trust us to get it into the sidebar or guidelines as soon as we can.</p></p>

<p><p>Also, I'd urge everyone to contribute most evidence as screen caps and images. I'm not at all suggesting breaking the rules, but for those items that may lay in the grey area for doxxing (compiling publicly available social media info for instance), if it's in a photo, it can't be searched from a search engine making discovery more difficult.</p></p>

<p><p>One case appeared to have a chance of a girl still alive after several years and the OP reported it - That is what I worry about with it all. I pray they (law enforcement) is at least following our work and acting on it when it hits that threshold. </p></p>
