<strong>Reddit - Secret Pizza Party</strong>
<p><p>Note: Can't reddit format for shit, but there is stuff in this subreddit that is worth digging into. </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/secretpizzaparty/ : (Subreddit title related to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xon1546ZwDs)</p>
<p>Link to subreddit active a few years ago. Features many of the videos associated with investigation thus far into pizzagate.</p>
<p>Including this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4byEHgi2nUE</p>
<p>A link to "In Love Sailor Moon gif" with the title DAE feel like this when they see hot, delicious pizza?</p>
<p>This link titled us irl: http://31.media.tumblr.com/c1f01c96a21dd8e374413e42924928f4/tumblr_msepd76hy71rzjvxxo1_500.png</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/secretpizzaparty/comments/1il8h0/where_is_a_good_place_to_order_pizza_from/</p>
<p>Comments from this thread:
where is a good place to order pizza from?? like not papa johns but somewhere else</p>
<p>i've had the best luck with local pizza places rather than large pizza chains, so i'd look into some local places. maybe read online reviews of some places if you'd like?</p>
<p>never buy from pizza chains</p>
<p>somewhere that sells gluten free crusts pls</p>
<p>Where do you live?</p>
<p>Are there stairs in your house? Go stand by the stairs.</p>
<p>my favorite pizza comes from a joint called Tarantino's in Pasadena, CA. (On Green Street, if you're so inclined...) They have a florentine pizza that causes me to salivate when I think of it. Amazing. I will drive out there, buy two and eat it for every meal for two days.</p>
<p>In reviewing post history of users of this subreddit, many describe themselves as asexual, bisexual, satanists and suicidal. </p></p>

<p><p>A lot of them post on https://www.reddit.com/r/just_post/<br/>
Checking this sub and it has a lot of weird comments that might be a code for something (doggo, hebhob and so on).  </p>
<p>Check this one  </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/just_post/comments/59as04/hella_pizzay/  </p>
<p>"When no one was looking, ChloePrice4Eve took forty pizzas. She took 40 pizzas. Thats as many as <strong>four tens</strong> (<strong>WTF</strong>). And that's pretty great"  </p>
<p>and someone replied  </p>
<p>"just post is very pizza-y at the moment <strong>these are dangerous times if you are susceptible to pizza cravings</strong>! ðŸ˜±"</p></p>

<p><p>The 40 pizzas thing is a reference to a Lex Luthor meme about him stealing 40 cakes.</p>

<p><p>Doggo is internet slang for dog. That one isn't too troubling, unless dog is code for something.</p></p>

<p><p>I just started investigating this whole thing myself. I wouldn't put to much stock into r/secretpizzaparty/ being anything noteworthy, Upon going over the active users and most of the posts I think I can solidly conclude that its a harmless in-joke of some description that is unrelated to pizzagate.</p></p>

<p><p>A weird post of one of the moderators of /r/justpost which is linked to secret pizza party asking for donations with some weird references, also in comments a lot of refferences to pizza  </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/just_post/comments/5ce83k/dear_posters_well_get_right_to_it_today_we_ask/  </p>
<p>Original post:  </p>
<p>"Dear posters, We'll get right to it: Today we ask you to help just_post. To protect our hebhobs, we'll never run ads. We're sustained by donations averaging about $15. Only a tiny portion of our posters give. If every-body reading this right now gave $3, our fundraiser would be done within an hour.<br/>
We're a non-profit with the costs of a top post: posts, mods and hebhobs. just_post is something special. It is like a library or a public park where we can all go to post. If just_post is useful to you, please take one minute to keep it online and growing.  </p></p>
