<strong>Feds bust global sex ring, with indictments in Minnesota **!!!codeword expansion!!!**</strong>
<p><p>Edit: articles from October 2016</p>
<p>http://www.startribune.com/feds-to-announce-bust-of-global-sex-ring/395996911/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What makes this particular case so significant is that global impact, how large this network was," said Alex Khu, special agent in charge for U.S. Homeland Security Investigations. "We're talking about pretty much all of the major metropolitan hubs â€” so the reach of this organization is massive."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to a 35-page indictment returned under seal by a federal grand jury last week, the conspiracy dated to at least 2009 and targeted nearly a dozen U.S. cities, including Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Chicago, Las Vegas and <strong>Washington, D.C</strong>. Authorities are still working to identify more victims, but early estimates were in the "hundreds."</p>

<p><p>It is global. Our politicians are controlled via blackmail no different than gangs or the mafia, lest the secrecy. They are forced to either go along with the trade off -do what Rothschild says and get unbelievable power- or take a bullet to the back of the head, or simply fail in politics and/or business. Most choose the former, to enter into a tight pedophilia occult blackmail ring. This is the content of the Dead Man's Switch which has been suppressed by massive forces. Hitler tried to annihilate this monolithic conspiracy. We are taught from a young age (7 years old for me) to be triggered whenever someone says Hitler. "Pure evil" immediately comes to mind.</p>
<p>The true history has been buried. Churchill, Eisenhower, and DeGualle never mentioned the holocaust in the volumes in which they recounted WWII. It would seem imparative to mention if you were an Allies general recalling the history of WWII. They would think, "If the Nazi's wouldn't have killed millions of people, potential workers and soldiers, then maybe they would have won". The Redcross report of 1948 mentioned the holocaust as a silly hoax (that's even a couple years after the war).  The holocaust and the evil of Nazi Germany was a lie, and we have been bred to hate the only people in history who have ever rebelled against this syndicate. I love Jews. Don't mistake my words for antisemitism. Jewish people are in no way to blame for any of our problems whatsoever. Hitler was absolutely wrong in this respect. However, he was correct about an "international clique" ruling our world. They do it through the grossest means imaginable.</p>
<p>If I am stupid, then none of this will make any sense and I apologize for wasting your time:</p>

I would imagine a door open
and behind it
I would find him there, waiting for me.

<p><p>Flowers, it reminds me of this Wikileaks Podesta email.</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/56939</p>
<p>Pedosta was part of the delegation to North Korea (not in any official role, acting for the "Center for American Progress"). Clinton and his "delegation" flew to North Korea on Steve Bing's Boeing 737. Steve Bing is <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5axyn9/yesterday_i_broke_a_story_about_the_clintons/">tied</a> to Epstein and the pedoring. And of course the infamous pizza.jpg pictures as you know is of the two "journalists" brought back from that trip (who were "investigating" sex trafficking and got caught in North Korea).</p>
<p>At the end of his official remarks (see email attachment), Clinton oddly <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/56939">said</a> that during the official arrival ceremony at the airport a few hours earlier, he had received a <strong>"beautiful bouquet of flowers from an even more beautiful little North Korean child"</strong>. </p></p>

<p><p>~~The "said" link is a duplication of the top link, but I remember that quote~~... Nm realized it was in the pdf</p>
<p>This Might be worth its own post tbh</p>

<p><p>Flowers is a common word used in Asian cultures for young women.  Remember the flower beads on the Obama Biden bracelet?</p></p>

<p><p>That's not really concrete. Up until now there hasn't been any significant mention of flowers like there has with pasta or pizza. Perhaps different groups have different words?</p></p>

<p><p>See my comment in the main comment thread about "flowers" oddly being referenced by Bill Clinton when talking about a "beautiful North Korean child". Who says such things in official remarks? Tie that in with the tongue-in-cheek "hidden in plain view" Easter eggs these creeps like to leave and the infamous context of that NK trip, you've got the flowers reference you were looking for. It was already hypothesized that they might have brought back NK children ("orphans") from that trip. </p>
<p>If anyone could find proof of that it'd be groundbreaking.</p></p>
