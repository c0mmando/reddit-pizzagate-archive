<p><p>Yeah, nail on the head. Same here. I think/hope if there is anything we can all bond over as americans it's that everybody hates child molesters. It has nothing to do with political parties or being gay or straight. It's the fact that once you have billions of dollars and have done everything in the world that money can buy, these people think the logical thing to do to get their jollies in is to kidnap, rape, torture, and murder children.</p></p>

<p><p>Epstein's brother testified to it in court in 2009. Trump also has 14 separate phone numbers listed in Epstein's black book. When Epstein was asked in court if he was friends with Trump and if Trump had ever been around when minors were there, Epstein took the 5th. </p>
<p>https://news.vice.com/article/the-salacious-ammo-even-donald-trump-wont-use-in-a-fight-against-hillary-clinton-bill-clinton</p>
<p>Not the best source, but the information I stated is what is substantiated by court records and the black book</p></p>

<p><p>Pleading the 5th can be anything. Could be an attempt at making him seem guilty without saying anything. The proof is in the fact he does not appear in the flight logs.</p></p>

<p><p>Absolutely; the worst thing we can do is waste time encouraging their psy ops while they get away with destroying the lives of children.</p>

<p><p>As a mature adult, can you really say that's respectful? That me hoping that there's not an insane amount of children being abducted and molested by the shadow government and members of world government, possibly due to ET involvement is not allowed? I should hope it's true or what, what's acceptable to you?</p>

<p><p>Agreed. As an aside, what kind of response are people getting when they are posting about this subreddit in the comment section of other subreddits? I'm getting massacred. Maybe I should've worded my comment differently? https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/5dqk0m/mall_santa_loses_job_for_telling_girl_hillary/</p></p>

<p><p>This is a subject that I still can't quite believe, and I read the the FBIanon post live, as it happened.  No one is ready to swallo this red pill. This subreddit could very easily uncover the whole truth and absolutely nothing could happen. We're entirely dependent on the FBI doing their jobs.  Be prepared to be 100% disappointed. </p></p>

<p><p>Yes. It's a sad fact that we may never see these creatures brought to justice. If only people would try to understand, but it's just easier keeping their heads in the sand while they stay in their warm, fuzzy bubble. </p></p>

<p><p>The general consensus is that Comey has been corrupted from day 1 and will do nothing. They will use to premise of "national security, to ensure peace, avoid civil war". This is bullshit. We have to trust Trump for now, but if he doesn't replace Comey, and if within the first year, nothing substantial gets done, we are going to have to initiate phase 4: armed insurrection.
 People suspected of pedophilia, occultism, corruption, or generally morally dubious behavior, are just going to have to vanish into thin air.</p></p>

<p><p>Not always enough. Trolls will sometimes be subtle enough to fool others. You may have to engage them, look at their post history, check them out on SnoopSnoo, etc.</p>
<p>I mean <a href="http://snoopsnoo.com/u/bruhtbh">this guy</a> has been pretending to be "politically neutral" but... well. You tell me if he looks like a concern troll.</p>
<p>Look at that word cloud, "Trump" is the #1 term by far. Activity timeline shows a huge increase in posting this month, coinciding with his joining /r/pizzagate. Checking his posting history reveals that he was consistently anti-Trump prior to joining /r/pizzagate and had zero criticism of Clinton or anyone on the left. However, as of this past month or so, he's suddenly all about investigating the Podestas and the Clintons AND DONALD TRUMP, HE'S DEFINITELY INVOLVED IN ALL THIS, DON'T FORGET DONALD TRUMP IS FRIENDS WITH CLINTON AND JEFFREY EPSTEIN GUYS DID I MENTION DONALD TRUMP WAS ACCUSED OF RAPING A CHILD DONALD TRUMP DONALD TRUMP DONALD TRUMP.</p>
<p>And a lot of his posts here have been upvoted into double digits.</p>

<p><p>I hate that there are people out there that do that. I did just submit a post about me being concerned. It was not a troll post it was a question on how to further spread the news. Immideaitely afterwardos I started dropping bugs in peoples ears to check out this subreddit. Doug giles at clash daily being one. Todd starnes another to very prominent conservative figure heads who could be beneficial to have on our side. They could help to put this on a national level.</p></p>
