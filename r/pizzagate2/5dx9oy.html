<strong>Tavistock/Hollywood Connection</strong>
<p><p>So at this point, everyone should know that Soros owns Tavistock, the group which this sub has found contributing to the DC pedophile ring we're all trying to uncover. </p>
<p>Now, this group also pulls the strings at the RAND Corporation. </p>
<p>According to this<a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_tavistock05.htm"> article</a> detailing all of Tavistock's holdings, here's the more specific link:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without a doubt, RAND is THE think tank most beholden to Tavistock Institute and certainly the RIIAâ€™s most prestigious vehicle for control of United States policies at every level.</p>
<p>Specific RAND policies that became operative include our ICBM program, prime analyses for U.S. foreign policy making, instigator of space programs, U.S. nuclear policies, corporate analyses, hundreds of projects for the military, the Central intelligence Agency (CIA) in relation to the use of mind altering drugs like peyote, LSD <strong><em>(the covert MK-Ultra operation which lasted for 20 years).</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yup. This group started MK ULTRA with the CIA. Now, the Rand corporation is HUGE. It's practically a wing of the US military, and earns revenue + endowment at about $500 million annually. </p>
<p>The MKULTRA program, by the way, was conducted in California. It's why even today there's a lot of speculation about some Hollywood celebs being under the influence--<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeVl70wMygA">Britney Spears</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAZvnj-ojf4">Amanda Bynes</a>, Anna Nicole Smith, Lindsay Lohan, etc... and that's not counting the promotion of mind control in seemingly-normal celebs like Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, etc. Let me know if you want more interesting vids or articles to convince you that this is a "thing" in Hollywood. </p>
<p>So going back to the Rand Corporation in California. I notice the founder is <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelDRich">Michael Rich</a>, who is also on the advisory board of... <a href="http://everychildfoundation.org/about-us/our-leadership/jackies-bio/">EveryChild Foundation</a> in Los Angeles. They're always tied to charities related to children, right? Also notice the creepy logo of a hand holding the head of a child, JUST LIKE in the mural art of Comet Ping Pong. </p>
<p>EveryChild Foundation is a little weird because other than <em>talking</em> about kids, the only other thing they seem to do is give money/grants to other organizations that work with kids. This next allegation is wholly unfounded as of now, but are these grants actually paying for access to these children?</p>
<p>I'm looking at the activities of this organization and one is holding salons, or, roundtable meetings at homes. One such talk was from a Rand child psychiatrist, <a href="http://everychildfoundation.org/archives/past-salons/">Brad Stein</a>, who talked of helping <em>children exposed to violence.</em> And if you look at the guy's <a href="http://www.rand.org/about/people/s/stein_bradley.html">bio</a> over at the same institute that created MK ULTRA, it includes things like: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"disseminating a school-based intervention for <strong><em>students exposed to trauma and violence</em></strong>" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"including children and adults with depression, children with ADHD, children with autism, <strong><em>children receiving psychotropic medications,</em></strong>" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Stein's recent work involves using technology to support the dissemination and implementation of <strong><em>effective interventions for traumatized children."</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There just seems something sinister to all of this. I'm going to do more digging, but I'm interested in looking more into 1) Rand's work that seems related to MK Ultra, especially with kids, 2) The founders of Rand and trying to tie them back with our existing stuff, and 3) This children's foundation.</p></p>

<p><p>So, EveryChild Foundation is soon going to be called, "Family for EveryChild" which is... wait for it... a Clinton Global Initiative recipient (also minor update that the Rand Corporation has worked with the Clinton Global Initiative in the past, see link below). </p>
<p>One of the largest Clinton donors, Haim Saban, has a wife, Cheryl... <a href="http://www.selfworthfoundation.org/meet-the-founder">who is</a> on the board of trustees for the Clinton Foundation and also claims association with EveryChild. </p>
<p>In addition, EveryChild speaks of "new relationships in the Gulf region" <em>and</em> Caribbean (Haiti?)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are in our second year of membership within the <strong><em>Clinton Global lnitiative (CGl)</em></strong> which has led to
promising leads, CGI is not only a platform for supporting our fundraising efforts but also provides an
opening for Family to engage with its audience for advocacy purposes. New relationships in the Gulf
region and Caribbean have been formed with a number of foundations met at the CGI meetings, which
we will continue to cultivate in 2015116. Family has made substantial headway within the CGI
development agenda, by being invited to provide input into the organisation's agenda, specifically for
the Children and Families, Survive and Thrive program.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Connections to Rand/Tavistock-linked EveryChild:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Family has continued to receive significant financial support from EveryChild. <strong><em>Both organisations are
working closely together at Board and senior management level to support EveryChild as it winds
down its operations in preparation for the anticipated transfer of its assets and resources to Family in
March 2017 following extensive due diligence.</em></strong> Family has been sharing project updates, case studies
and member news to support EveryChild's fundraising efforts to promote Family's work with its
individual supporter base. We are very grateful for the ongoing support from EveryChild which has
provided us with a level of financial security whilst we invest in developing new income streams and
approaches to building relationships with donors and supporters.</p>

</p>
<p><p>A few of the things this org does:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Family has been awarded a grant by Oak Foundation to implement over three years a learning network
on recovery and reintegration following child sexual exploitation (CSE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>training multidisciplinary teams to conduct forensic interviews with children reporting their experiences of sexual violence. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Main objectives:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Providing Quality Alternative Care: we will ensure a range of high-quality, appropriate
alternative care choices for children</p>
<p>Protecting Children Outside of any Care: we willtake steps to prevent children from having
to live outside of any adult care, without the care of families or other carers. <strong><em>We will protect
these boys and girls that are outside of any care in the interim</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So basically... they're setting themselves up to take in kids who have allegedly been abused, including ones of sexual exploitation, and they're networking with all the local NGOs, government authorities, etc, of several countries.</p></p>

<p><p>Creepily, EveryChild used to be known as:</p>
<p>EveryChild Trading Ltd (seriously? "Child Trading?")</p>
<p>Which before that used to be called, "The Romanian Orphanage Trading Company."</p>
<p>The guy on the registration paperwork is <a href="http://www.checkcompany.co.uk/director/377181/PETER-FREDERICK-BARTON-BEESLEY">Peter Frederick Barton Beesley</a>, who is associated with over 90 such companies, namely religious schools, and Catholic churches (because it's not like there haven't been problems with pedophilia there or anything).</p>
<p>Here's its history of paperwork:

<p><p>Update on the Romanian Orphanage Trading Company: it was <a href="http://poundpuplegacy.org/node/73670">accused of</a> embezzling funds and financial malfeasance. Also worth noting that Romania was a country notorious for orphanages filled with abuse, neglect, etc. </p>
<p>This group renamed itself to the European Children's Trust.</p></p>
