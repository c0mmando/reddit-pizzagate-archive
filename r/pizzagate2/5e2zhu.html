<strong>Twitter Situation Speculation - TSS</strong>
<p><p>What if this is a ploy to honeypot the movement into illegally accessing CP? Or some other variation of attack on #pizzagate. It seems really oddly timed, and could potentially overshadow the coverage #pizzagate will get from MSM tomorrow </p></p>

<p><p>I'm not calling blame on anyone, this whole thing happened very suddenly though. It's awfully fishy. </p>
<p>It's great of you to of shared it, discussion is vital. Let's keep this in perspective though, and avoid becoming jaded to this whole ordeal. This.Is.Odd.</p></p>

<p><p>If you have 1 or 2 on your computer from twitter it was a mistake... if you just keep clicking on all of them and saving the pics for later... then you got a problem. </p>
<p>If you think pizzagate and twitter pedophiles aren't related you're not thinking about it hard enough. </p></p>

<p><p>This is terrible information, and you are pushing a bias that would derail further inquisition into Comet(Judging by your post history). This leads me to believe the Twitter Situation could be real, but timed as a last ditch effort to distract.</p>
<p>"I like your thinking... investigate pizza places all around the U.S. instead of just DC... the DC horse is dead... time to move on... I offer up "Pizza Pipeline" in Washington State... very close ties to the military and some very sketchy pictures on their facebook..."</p></p>

<p><p>Holy Fuck... if you think Comet is the only establishment in america trafficking children you are a fucking idiot. </p>
<p>Just like Marina AbramoviÄ‡ is the only satanist... </p>
<p>How do you distract from pedophilia with more pedophilia... sounds like you are a #pizzagate hashtag gloryhog and don't actually care about the big picture...</p></p>

<p><p>I don't understand what you think is actually happening... are you under the impression that there is only one place in the US that abuses children and it is Comet Pizza? I can understand your behavior if this is your job to keep everyone focused on the dead horse of Comet Pizza... but you are shitty at it.</p></p>

<p><p>Okay, so what do you propose, Sherlock? Start a whole new investigation into an unrelated restaurant for no apparent reason? Because they sell pizza? </p>
<p>Right as we are about to blow the lid on the largest corruption case in American history? It's a "dead horse" though right? </p>
<p>You're just upset we caught on to your game, and that we can play it better. Good day, sir.</p></p>

<p><p>Nope... you guys have tunnel vision. You don't think the FBI already has Podesta on lockdown? They need us to expand the web and get all the little guys out there... We aren't responsible to build an entire case file... just like we implicated Comet... we can do that with anyone else that is guilty. You are just too dumb to see the big picture... </p>
<p>Here... http://imgur.com/a/Ugosn is that "apparent reason" enough for you... or should I point out all the users of their site that are deeply entrenched military? </p>
<p>I'm sorry... but you are just too dumb to be good at investigating. </p></p>

<p><p>Its stops being odd if you realize that no one was really looking or trying to do anything about all the cases of pedophilia in the world.</p>
<p>Then what happens? BOOM! We drop onto the scene. A large group of highly dedicated <em>independent</em> investigators working outside of traditional channels. And what happens? We find out that this sickness is endemic and institutionalized. Run by the very people we trusted to root it out. And its everywhere.</p>
<p>Can't swallow that pill? You will, its true all of it and its only going to get worse.</p></p>

<p><p>It's possible, but at the end of the day, it's still kiddie porn sitting out on a public site, isn't it?  Millions of people use twitter.   I can't be held criminally liable for what someone on my twitter feed posts.  </p>
<p>I'm not going to go access any of it, but there's enough people saying they've confirmed it that I'm going to give it some consideration.</p></p>

<p><p>I agree, but it is incredibly odd we've "discovered" THOUSANDS of accounts with CP on them. Right.Now. SEO keyword high-jack? MSM will definitely talk about this tomorrow.</p>
<p>Nobody noticed the CP before this? Really?</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah, it's very suspicious.  Everything is suspicious to be honest.  My first question would be, how long have these twitter accounts been active, when was all this stuff posted?</p>
<p>If these are thousands of twitter accounts created in the last month, I think we have our answer.  I'm not going to look for myself though.</p></p>

<p><p>I think there were several that had Nov 2016 dates for account activation.</p>

<p><p>Needed to discover only one of them to discover the rest. Checked one of the accounts to make sure people weren't bullshitting, and all of the followers of that account were similar judging by their profile-pics. Stopped going any further at that point.</p></p>

<p><p>One user clearly sold their account and was posting account links.</p>
<p>I don't trust this. If it's real, wait for it to spread. In the meantime, be cool.</p>
<p>Seriously. With the promises from earlier I feel we've been lead down the garden path. </p></p>
