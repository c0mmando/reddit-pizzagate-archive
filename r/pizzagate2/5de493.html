<strong>Things we SHOULD &amp; SHOULDN'T focus on</strong>
<p><p>Hey, guys. I'm a conspiracy nut just like the rest of you but here are a few things I think we should really keep in mind.</p>
<h1>DON'T Focus on...</h1>
<p>Spirit Cooking</p>
<p>The Occult</p>
<p>Satanic Worship</p>
<h1>DO Focus on...</h1>
<p>Haiti</p>
<p>Child Trafficking</p>
<p>Comet Pizza &amp; Related Businesses</p>
<p>I know that they're all intertwined but if you're trying to explain Pizzagate to someone and start off with "sacrifices to Moloch," you're not going to sound very convincing.</p>
<p>The truth is out there! Keep up the good work!</p></p>

<p><p>To completely avoid a crutial part of this investigation such as spirit cooking would be a bad idea, we could possibly miss vital information that we wouldn't have found otherwise. How we translate this information is at everyones discretion but as we compile and organize information our ability to explain and connect the dot between the two will become easier.</p></p>

<p><p>I agree. I meant this more when concerning spreading the information as opposed to looking into it. Search every lead possible.</p></p>

<p><p>Especially since there is strong evidence that Hillary has Kuru. A neurodegentrive disorder that can only be contracted by consuming human brain material.</p></p>

<p><p>I agree, there is some very real shady shit going on and starting off conversations with "satanic worship" makes us seem no better than the guys going around whining about the NWO illuminati reptilians who are to blame for everything.</p></p>

<p><p>Yes. True or not, the red pill needs to be digestible to outsiders.</p></p>

<p><p>I think Hillary herself is completely opened up by the Silsby connection, and if the family of Monica Petersen decides to pursue action that is a door to a whole world of possible outcomes. </p></p>

<p><p>Yes. There's a lot to Laura Silsby. We need as much information on her as we can get.</p></p>

<p><p>How can you avoid a topic that is a very big part of this whole thing?  Why do you think they mix the two topics?  Well for one it's hard for anyone to think all this is real when you talk about it.... But it's there so you have to talk about it</p></p>

<p><p>Has everyone forgotten that the Clinton Foundation is playing a large part in all of this? I have seen very little if anything on this sub and other discussions on the chans that even remotely attempt to connect any of the to the CF, which is more than likely a central player in this shit. </p>
<p>If we don't find ways to actually connect all this shady shit to the CF, the Clinton's will be able to maintain plausible deniability and walk away from this all. Leaving behind the small fry like Besta and Comet and the others. We need to make sure we look as carefully as possible in order to actually connect this to the Clinton's, or the masterminds of all of this will be able to start all over again once the attention goes away.</p></p>
