<strong>This subhas been compromised. Look at mod list &amp; post histories. You have been warned. Look at patterns.</strong>
<p><p>Look at previous thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5diq3u/are_we_compromised/</p>
<p>Locked. The mod who locked it is 3 months old. This is exactly what happened in WikiLeaks subreddit.</p>
<p>This post will be locked/deleted. My only hope is that one of you sees this before it happens.</p></p>

<p><p>Yes they are! Have you noticed all the posts about religion on 4chan? Trying to divide people while arguing about religion.</p>
<p>That never happens on 4chan. Whole board is under psyop.</p></p>

<p><p>speaking as a mod, I can tell you just by looking at the mod queue that you are absolutely off base with this assertion. If the subreddit were in anyway 'compromised' its either from so high up with admins where they have their own filtering system we mods can't see or more likely a front end attack from people like you constantly claiming this subreddit is compromised and to avoid paying it any attention.</p></p>

<p><p>Woah. Why so offended!?  Not a personal attack</p>
<p>If you are honest, wouldn't you want a system like this in place?  I'm genuinely asking. </p>
<p>This is a discussion - is love to hear a downside to implementing an early alert system?</p></p>

<p><p>You are right we need to set up a way of setting up an early alert system so if the mods get locked out we can communicate. I can verify what /u/pizzapartywithkids said, that right now we aren't being censored (unless it's done in a way that us mods cannot see).</p>
<p>Right now our only off-reddit systems are the voat and the <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#pizzagate:matrix.org">chat on the matrix protocol</a> - come in and say hi, as if you have a solution for communicating to reddit users AFTER it's been compromised (some kind of canary) would be amazing.</p></p>

<p><p>I actually thought about this a bit in the last half hour and I think its a good idea we sign our posts, at least if we are speaking officially with a self-identifiable hash.</p>

<p><p>*PGP</p>
<p>The security is much better with PGP because its a dual key system but it would get pretty messy if we were signing posts with a public key every time.</p>
<p>Here's my same hash in the public PGP key</p>

<p><p>It's a lot less suspicious than going into full smear and denial mode like Alefantis. The fact that they went out of there way to post here shows a lot, frankly.</p>
<p>And the gematria thing was bullshit anyway. It's THE thing people make fun of conspiracy culture for: assigning numbers to letters, adding them, and making connections.</p></p>

<p><p>The only thing compromising the subreddit are children (who contribute nothing) calling decent posters "shills" and tin-foil hatters posting irrelevant nonsense. The problem isn't censorship. It's brute force retardation/spam. And I suspect it's intentional. Gotta love the "troll" generation. </p></p>

<p><p>It is very interesting to see a moderator with no karma or post history.</p>
<p>They were secretive in that thread, too. I'm not going to "message the mods" because they "don't want people to panic".</p>
<p>This is a subreddit about a conspiracy theory, and they decide to be secretive about giving a no name account mod?</p>

<p><p>If you're not posting in or subscribing to this sub using a disposable account I advise you to do so now. This isn't a topic to take lightly considering who is being discussed and how much influence they have. This is my oldest throwaway account. Good luck finding anything worthwhile in my history that confirms your baseless theories.</p></p>

<p><p>Explanation: We want to create new accounts which don't have as much PII. Basic opsec. Some of the mods are using older burner accounts and we want them to be able to protect themselves. Come chat off reddit. Most of the mods are on matrix. Come <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#pizzagate:matrix.org">into the reception room and have a chat</a></p>
<p>In the meantime I'm locking this. We honestly appreciate that we are being held accountable. Any further discussion about moderation or censorship needs to point to examples.</p></p>
