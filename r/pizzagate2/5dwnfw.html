<strong>Cannibal original came from "Spirit" cooking - cannibal, which comes from Cahan-Bal priest of Baal - Moloch again.</strong>
<p><p>Spirit cooking was the ultimate meaning of the "food code".</p>
<p>As shown in an abundance of pictures going around from the spirit video, pictures of them eating a dead corpse, and even a painting on John Podesta's office wall of them eating a corpse, it's a satanic ritual murder cult.</p>
<p>The cookbook was a spell/ritual book, the "meteorite" you put in your mouth was the same as the picture of eating a corpse - also called "meat of rite". It was "spiritual" cooking, because "rites" are "spiritual".</p>
<p>After I researched this, I found that there are also many books that show that "cannibal" original came from "cana baal" or priest of baal, because the priests of baal used to eat their victims too - this is the molech stuff again.
"Kohen or cohen (or kohain; Hebrew: כֹּהֵן, "priest", pl. כֹּהֲנִים kohanim) is the Hebrew word for priest used colloquially in reference to the Aaronic ... " Answer (1 of 3): There is a lot of variations of the name Cohen, which means priest. * English: Cohen, Cowen, Cahn, Cahan, Carne, Cohn, Cone, Conn, Conway, Cohan ... Thus we have the word, cannibal, which comes from Cahan-Bal priest of Baal.  A number of emails mention Moloch.  The one with sacrificing a "chicken" to Molech letter wise looks like "children" (chickens weren't sacrifice to Molech, it isn't even a common usage word, but keeps reappearing).</p></p>

<p><p>I keep posting some of the pictures that go with this, and they keep getting deleted.
1) corpse pictures with "lady gaga"
2) recipe spell spiritual cooking pages with breast milk and sperm "milk" on one page, and "meteorite" - meat of rite on another.
3) painting from John Podesta's office showing eating of corpses.
4) references to molech / baal worship by elites
etc etc.</p></p>

<p><p>I'll hijack this thread to remind everyone that Hillary's health symptoms are extremely aligned with Kuru Disease as well. The tremors &amp; shaking, inability to climb stairs on her own without help, abrupt laughter, and the sore on her tongue are all symptoms of Kuru- a prion disease acquired by eating infected human brains.</p></p>

<p><p>Note, many have suggested the shape of the comet looks like a sperm dripping.  using comet could be like "mete o rite", both are a 'spacey' set of code words for what they are doing.  Also, John Podesta is suppose to be into alien stuff - another way to disguise this.  See the cannibal picture he has in his office again.<br/>

<p><p>I believe you're on the right track! May I add that the founder of the Children of God church, Berg, who was a pedophile and promoted pedophilia within his org, predicted that a comet was going to wipe out the Earth. The date he predicted it to happen proved uneventful. The collective words 'Comet Ping Pong' makes me think of planets bumping together, and combined with what you've stated, this is another rabbit hole. By the way, the Church of God is now called The Family International and their choir performed for the White House during daddy Bush's reign and into Bill Clinton's presidency.</p></p>

<p><p>for some yes.  Some of the disassociation follows watching others - playmates, siblings get murdered and not being able to do anything about it.</p>
<p>They sometimes murder adults too.  I've had three different informers - five if you count people not being entirely straight up, tell me about ritual murders they saw where they put everyone on lsd before it happened.  you're left hanging there with a big grin on your face watching it (one of the effects of lsd) and feeling helpless.</p>
<p>And I'm left here feeling helpless having the same things described to me year after year by different people, and not being able to get at anyone of them by the justice system.  fyi - dissociation and torture, trauma is only part of this.  Look up "Jean Houston" who performed the seance at the White House with Hillary Clinton in the 90s, and look up Jean Houston's research in trance states, LSD (government research), mystery schools and goddess research.</p>
<p>After you puke, realizing this is all real, look up "hypnotic amnesia" and also drug use in mystery religions for a scientific explanation to two more things they are doing.</p></p>

<p><p>Well it's a semitic word, so there is no specific correlation to Jews. In fact actually described in the old testament in detail are the vile sacrifices performed by the baal-worshipers who were ancient enemies of the Hebrew people at the time of the second temple. Its also a common misconception here that moloch was a god, when in fact it pertains to the specific sacrificial ritual they followers of Baal would perform. You should look it up its pretty cool (and completely abhorrent) stuff</p></p>

<p><p><a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cannibal">Not so</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>cannibal (n.) Look up cannibal at Dictionary.com
"human that eats human flesh," 1550s, from Spanish canibal, caribal "a savage, cannibal," from Caniba, Christopher Columbus' rendition of the Caribs' name for themselves (see Caribbean). The natives were believed to be anthropophagites. Columbus, seeking evidence that he was in Asia, thought the name meant the natives were subjects of the Great Khan. Shakespeare's Caliban (in "The Tempest") is from a version of this word, with -n- and -l- interchanged, found in Hakluyt's "Voyages" (1599). The Spanish word had reached French by 1515. Used of animals from 1796. An Old English word for "cannibal" was selfæta.</p>

<p><p>Christopher Columbus was a Christian who named many things from the Bible.   The word comes from where I said, and I didn't come up with it - many sources for it online.  The new world itself is from the bible, and was suppose to be a fulfilment of bible prophecy, God will make a new world, and all former things will pass away.  </p>
<p>Suggest you research Christopher Columbus and his religious reasons for discovering new world, etc.  </p></p>

<p><p>That's odd, I didn't have much trouble finding many sources for it, including Two Babylons by Hislop.  I also looked up the Hebrew, and it is correct.</p>
<p>For the record, I'm very used to doing etymology research, have a long history of reading history for what others are trying to conceal and am a history buff, and have an anthropology degree as well as  several graduate..</p>
<p>I've also have had many informers over the years, and have seen some of this as a kid.  I have zero doubt my history or biblical meaning here is correct - and can add more to the thread.  I think the pictures speak for themselves that that is what the "spirit cooking" book is.</p></p>

<p><p>In example, just randomly got this - I'm not claiming it's the best source, I looked it up myself in a hebrew to see it can be derived that way, and that it matched human sacrifices and bal in the bible.  That use of meaning goes back hundreds of years at least.
http://onthecheese.com/seekerworld/two-babylons/c-h.html  </p>
<p>"- Did you ever wonder about the origin of the word 'Cannibal?'
From 'Cahna-bal' or a 'priest of Baal ' 
When researching the origins of the word 'cannibal' meaning a 'human that eats human flesh,' most sources go back only as far as Christopher Columbus in the 1550s; to the word 'Caniba' and how Columbus believed that the name denoted that the natives were subjects of the Great Khan."  (not my source, just random link to show how common it is online)  </p>
<p>fyi on the moloch.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch has an old  picture of him with an oven for cooking human sacrifices - which looks like a pizza oven.  </p>
<p>http://dailyprayer.us/photos/Moloch.png  </p>
<p>PS I was doing unrelated research on words derived from bal, like Jezebel, when I saw it.  Plenty of discussion on words derived from bal, baal out there.</p></p>

<p><p>Moloch is never identified with the figure of an owl in traditional sources. Ishtar, however, was portrayed with owl feet and wings. While I totally believe that the elites are deeply into Luciferian mystery cults, I have to point this out.</p>
<p>https://littleguyintheeye.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/ishtar-owl.jpg</p>
<p>Minerva/Athena, the Graeco-Roman virgin goddess of wisdom ("sophia") was accompanied by an owl according to the ancient lore.</p>
<p>https://propheticalert.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/minerva-with-owl.jpg</p>
<p>For the record, all these pagan gods and goddesses revered by the elite are ultimately identified with Lucifer--at least in British Freemasonry (see the writings of authorities Manly P. Hall and Albert Pike for reference) and Theosophy (founded by Helena Blavatsky and championed by Alice A. Bailey, who--probably not coincidentally--popularized the idea of the "New World Order", using that precise term), which is effectively the official religion of the UN (study the life and career of Robert Muller and the activities of the UN-sanctioned Lucis Trust for evidence), as well as a Masonic offshoot. Alice Bailey's husband Foster Bailey was, unsurprisingly, a 32nd degree Freemason.  </p>
<p>Male-female duality (representing the counterparts of Sun and Moon, active and passive, order and chaos) is very important in occult symbolism; the figure of the Baphomet as depicted by Eliphas Levi, a leading French occultist of the 19th century, has androgynous features in reference to this metaphysical principle.</p>
<p>This stuff played a large part in converting me to Christianity, since it is beyond obvious that the globalist hierarchs are actual Satanists who despise the Biblical Jesus.</p></p>

<p><p>Whenver I read about Ishtar, the scene from Eyes Wide Shut where the naked girl appears on a balcony to save "Bill" comes to mind. She appears very much like the usual depiction of Ishtar. Also, Minerva is referenced in some of the emails in wikileaks.</p></p>

<p><p>Precisely. There is exactly one email that mentions Moloch in what can be easily explained as a lame joke referencing illuminati conspiracy theories. A reference to the Bohemian Grove is not a direct reference to Moloch either - especially since the suggestion is that the infamous Owl statue at BG is more likely a reference to the owl of Minerva. </p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that hiding the names of arcane shit in modern English words is kinda silly being that the languages have changed dramatically over the centuries... so "meteorite" in Hebrew is "מטאוריט" and i sincerely doubt that it breaks down to the phonetic words "meat" and "rite" in any language other than English. In short, anyone trying to use modern English as some sort of cypher isn't thinking critically about this.</p>
<p>There is plenty of actual material to pursue here... going on a linguistic/mythological goose chase without the proper knowledge or tools amounts to young adult literature level conspiracy theory. </p></p>

<p><p>The thread is about Spirit Cooking, and it is cannibalism. Cannibalism has been in history as about ritualistic magic for a long time. The word Cannibalism also comes from where I said; the Columbus thing is a red herring as he also used the Bible frequently.  This is like saying I read it someplace, and it makes me comfy to believe, so I don't need to research it or contrary - more real - opinion.  Human sacrifice goes back thousands of years and is described in the Bible. </p>
<p>The group being talked about do the same thing being described. The proof is in the pudding. QED.</p>
