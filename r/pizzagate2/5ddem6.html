<p>I am seeking more information about this but want to let you know before the 5pm call that 10 Amcits were reportedly arrested by Haitian police near the DR border with 33 Haitian children whom they reportedly planned to take to an orphanage they are establishing in the DR. They are currently under arrest at a PAP police station or, according to one report, at "the Justice Building near the airport." The whereabouts of the children is unknown. The group is called the <strong>New Life Children Refuge America Organization (NLCR)</strong>. Bill Bistransky found the attached "Plan of Action"(P0A) on their web site when he googled that name. As he notes, either today's arrest is their second run into Haiti to get children, or their original schedule is off.</p>

<p>Consular Affairs was notified by the Embassy duty officer in Santo Domingo of the arrest of 10 Amcits from Idaho by Haitian police. They were attempting to take 33 'orphans' to Santo Domingo for the stated purpose of establishing an orphanage to care for the children. The Americans are in the custody of the Haitian police. <strong>We have no information about the whereabouts of the 33 orphans.</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But evidence showed that most of the children still had living parents. 
During hearings in the case, Sainvil heard from 10 parents of children handed over to the Americans.They said they had turned them over because they had no food or water to give them, and believed they would have a better life with the missionaries elsewhere. 
These parents had pleaded for the Americans' release. </p>

<p><p>because it was not found that all were orphans, it says some of their parents gave them up since they had no food/water</p></p>

<p><p>Michel Zaleski giving money to Hillary.</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/21434</p>
<p>edit to add: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you see Michel Zaleski's 20k anywhere? I'm nervous about that one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Michel Zaleski Founded the DREAM Center Orphanage in Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>Should try to find out if is same orphanage in the cable.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I'm betting it is. Was built around the same time as the cable. 10 American citizens from IDAHO are probably Mormon and the Spencer Kimball Foundation also funded the construction.</p>
<p>Edit 3: Spencer Kimball's sister Kathryn Kimball is married to Peter Mattis, who donated to Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Mattis</p>
<p>Edit 4: The Pace Memorandum ties the Mormon Church, at the time, to satanic child ritual sacrifice where children were being sacrificed at an altar under the west end of the temple. The sacrifice would have been occurring at the same time as Spencer Kimball was president.</p>

<p><p>Not sure if anyone is monitoring this thread anymore,but just came across this stuff that I haven't seen in my research:</p>
<p>Lake Azuei is the hub of child trafficking between Haiti and the Dominican Republic:
http://www.alterpresse.org/spip.php?article13505#.WC4cXqIrLq0</p>
<p>Podesta emails discussing Lake Azuei:
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6022</p>
<p>Clinton foundation building a school, OF ALL PLACES, right by Lake Azuei in Haiti. Oddly though I am having a hard time finding out if the project is even started yet? Where is this school? Cmmd+F for Lake Azuei
