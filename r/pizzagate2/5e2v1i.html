<p><p>I have been following the story and done some research on my own.  A friend told me about the Reddit here.  I read a couple posts and don't know what all have been said.  Just offering but guess I need to read more.  Not a troll but just saw something about being told not to do private names or something.  I'm just disgusted that this could be Happening for real.</p></p>

<p><p>I didn't see it.  I read one post and it said something about not being able to post names or something of private people.  Just offering if you need a place to conglomerate.  The forum is empty.</p></p>

<p><p>I apologize but you can see I have been on the Donald for awhile.  I have been researching about this some too and disgusted.  My buddy in real life is a member of the Donald too and was over and told me about this sub.  I looked at one message because it was late and saw you had some privacy issues or limits on what you could post.  I want these scum to go down the tubes so offered to help.</p></p>
