<p><p>Jordan Chariton of tyt. Maybe he's worth contacting? He's currently reporting from DAPL. Seems like somebody with integrity, he went pretty hard at Donna Brazile once she was exposed. Here's his twitter handle  @jordanchariton </p></p>

<p><p>unless we have actual factual proof and not a pile of circumstantial evidence he will not report on it. Hopefully he would investigate it though.</p></p>

<p><p>I was hoping more insight from him, during all the podesta leaks he literally was going thru them all. Maybe he brushed it off at the time (or didn't make the connection) and in retrospect may think of something.</p></p>
