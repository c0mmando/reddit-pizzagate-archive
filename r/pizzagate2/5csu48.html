<p><p>Here is the portion we need to confirm beyond just taking the blogger's word for it:</p>
<p><strong>One of our FBI insiders can confirmed the Intelligence community  indicates John and Tony Podesta were in Praia da Luz,  Portugal on May 3rd 2007– the day Madaline McCann vanished.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Podesta brothers were staying with a friend named “Clem” . Clement Freud, the grandson of psychopathology sex expert Dr. Sigmund Freud, who was known to be a pedophile. This is a quote from our insider:  “Of greater interest is that fact that Freud owned a villa in Praia da Luz.</strong></p>
<p>Can somebody get in touch with the blogger and find out how they know this? Saying "an FBI insider told us" is insufficient. We need something publicly verifiable. </p>
<p>If Podesta was in Portugal on May 3rd, and the police efits match him, then it is time to lock and load and blow the lid off this thing. </p></p>

<p><p>Agreed, but it is a lead nonetheless.</p></p>

<p><p>Well I would assume the fbi insider is staying anonymous to protect his job and his life and the lives of those he loves. We can try, im not saying dont try, Im just saying that I doubt we will be able to find this person's identity </p></p>

<p><p>This is all very interesting and quite compelling if legitimate. However, the lack of citations is a big flag for the piece. I'm following leads to other aspects of Pizzagate but I'd love to see some followup for this.</p>
<p>Just stating that an anonymous insider tipped the public off about the fact that a known pederast had a known vacation home near the scene of the disappearance is not enough. We are missing solid citation on the communication between the McCanns and Freud and the Podestas and Freud.</p>
<p>There has been speculation elsewhere that John was very possibly in Portugal for a conference that was to take place a few hours north, a few days later. But there still hasn't been anything concrete beyond a lack of emails up to the day of the disappearance and the fact that on the day of her disappearance, the only released email from Podestas email account, isn't written by him, suggesting he wasn't around to respond to emails in an official capacity.</p>
<p>Edit: Here is an article discussing the McCann-Freud connection: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/abduction/?src=search -- https://archive.is/SmKeQ</p></p>

<p><p>Get this- Freud had "a passion for ping-pong"!!! :
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/oct/14/biography.features3</p>
<p>Also was friends with known paedophile entertainer Rolf Harris and has authored some odd-looking books:

<p><p>Wow that picture of Podesta playing cards with the family. It really looks like the picture of what Madeleine would look like now </p></p>
