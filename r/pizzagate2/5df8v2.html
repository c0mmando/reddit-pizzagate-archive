<strong>EYES WIDE SHUT - KUBRICK "SUSPICIOUSLY DIED" DIRECTLY AFTER FILMING</strong>
<p><p>watched this movie last night, thoughts? seems like the reason it doesn't seem like much happened in the movie is because it's simply a documentary, talk about pizza and handkerchiefs like the hookers name is domino and there's child sex slave in it already man just watch this hsits</p></p>

<p><p>A documentary - totally agree. </p>
<p>Also given Kidman's father was implicated in child sex ring.</p>

<p><p>I watched it last night, acting by Kidman and cruise is terrible and so disturbing after hearing bout her father an knowing that Cruise was definitely abused...middle of it got good, shit got actually really scary, but then it just ends, the ending was absolute shite, worst ending of a film I've ever seen</p></p>

<p><p>I remember reading there is hours of cut footage to bring down the time and rating from nc17 to R. Extended versions may have a more satisfying ending. </p></p>

<p><p>Godamn, I love this thought. I watched it two days ago for the first time &amp; felt like something was wrong with me that I thought it felt kind of just boring/normal. Extremely compelling in that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen which is rare for me. But just... normal. Which makes this all the more unsettling.</p></p>
