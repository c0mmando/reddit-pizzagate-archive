<strong>Why was the wethepizza hack thread removed?</strong>
<p><p>care to explain mods? their website has since changed to 'coming soon' and seems pretty suspect, why was that thread supressed? Other mods were actively posting in it...</p>
<p>Tagging these threads as likely hoax also seems suspicious at this point, especially as it seems legit now</p></p>

<p><p>I think it's reasonable to remove the post if it contained CP. </p>
<p>Whatever our intentions are here, posting CP to this sub is just asking for Reddit admins to shut the entire sub down. </p></p>

<p><p>If it was a honeypot, why wouldnt you leave it up as long as possible to catch as many people as possible.  This angle just doesnt make sense to me - why would you take it down as soon as only a small handful of people click it.  Bleh</p></p>

<p><p>I had the top comment there, calling out OP for being a troll.</p>
<p>The case is that we have a pizza shop in DC whereas the chef has connections with high ranking officials. And we have this person who posted disgusting, criminal material on the subreddit, alleging that it was obtained by hacking the site of the pizza shop. The fact that the chef at that pizza plays has ties to big name politicians is very damning, but the reality remains that the vital piece of information - the client list - was not shared by OP. So he could be forging this story.</p></p>

Okay. I searched google for: mendelsohn filetype:pdf and this came up. http://abra.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/abra/publication/attachments/WethePizzaetal-682016.pdf
Kookoovaya, Inc. is listed as "we, the pizza" headquartered in DC"</p>
<p>if you google kookoovaya it brings up lots of owl/pedo jewellery logos stuff... linking to other things that have appeared in the last week.. some really weird shit here</p></p>

<p><p>some redditors claims that there was a direct link to cp, (which to download is a felony) but there was nothing to tie it to that site. After doing simple research to the site (looking with webcrawlers for hidden files,) the site disappeared. Maybe it was a honypot.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah: In the original thread (was reading it when it was active) the OP said he had the files or w/e, and that the website's source code had recently been changed or something, and then all of a sudden the website changes to "Coming soon".. Very sketchy to me. However I should also note: I'm not as tech savvy as many others, so perhaps there is another explanation that escapes me. </p>
<p>edit: Just to clarify, I think it's sketchy that some people were saying that what the OP was saying (the source code being changed) was false (trying to discredit him maybe?) and then all of a sudden the site goes to "coming soon" mode. </p>
<p>Idk what to think. anyone? </p></p>

<p><p>I compared the wayback-machine source-code to to the site while it was still up, but the older archived versions seemed to be the same. So the part about the "whole site being completely different" seemed unlikely, unless he was talking about the admin/member areas or something.</p></p>

<p><p>My point is that if the guy had such solid evidence to bust some people, then thinking pizzagate mods are actually going to inhibit justice being done by censoring threads seems ridiculous to me.  Not to mention that the fact many people think these mods are compromised is paranoia imo</p>
<p>They do a good job and have been transparent</p>

<p><p>If the pedophiles really are running our government (all evidence indicates that they are), and if this was a REAL amateur hack of a child torture operation run for the amusement of our political and military leaders (it's possible), then you should have expected them to notice it immediately and to act on it. </p>
<p>The idea that the CIA et. al. runs a major pedophile ring for our politicians and DOES NOT monitor sites like this would be very, very, very naive. </p></p>

<p><p>Guys,</p>
<p>Whether it was legitimate or not we can't have an open thread with links to actual CP.  </p>
<p>That being said, why would the OP post the CP and not the other evidence that was not actually illegal (i.e. client list, "menu")?  A "honeypot" is not out of the realm of possibilities and anyone who downloaded the files should get it to the police immediately to protect themselves.  </p>
<p>It is very odd that the wethepizza.com is now shut-down.  It is accessible though waybackmachine.  Start digging, but protect yourself.</p>
<p>Most of all if you find anything like u/ihavedamningevidence found, get it to any local police department immediately to protect your self by establishing a chain of evidence.</p></p>

<p><p>Next time there is such a hoax/honeypot expect it to be less blatantly weak. Keep in mind people whoever did this went through the trouble of procuring not only CP but <strong>child snuff pictures</strong> (torture). This suggests a very determined OP.</p>
<p><strong>This experience needs to make our investigation stronger, more resilient to disinformation.</strong></p>
<p>Personally this kind of blatant and professional attempts at disinformation makes me only more angry and determined!</p>
<p>Here is what we need to look for next time this happens</p>

<p>Biggest <strong>red flag</strong> : the apparent hackers are talking about hacking the pizza parlour in DC, not the website on a server in Texas. </p>
<p>So if you want to believe them, that is that they stole it from the parlour, why is the server down? </p></p>

<p><p>I have been vetting /u/newfoundland_urth for a mod spot for the past week and I added him today because its currently the weekend our other moderators were not as active today as they have been, and the removal of the CP in this post was not handled quickly enough.</p>
<p>We cannot have posts with CP on this subreddit. Aside from the fact that this clearly violates Reddit TOS and will get the subreddit shut down, we do not need people investigating pizzagate downloading CP onto their computers and compromising themselves. </p></p>

<p><p>Be sure to point out any time you think I am colluding with the enemy, okay?  Again I urge you to read through my post history.  I have been in this sub from the beginning, and was added to help answer important questions like this thread.  As you can imagine it is tough to trust anyone.  I realize the timing may appear to be suspicious but I can assure you I want nothing more than to expose child abuse in Washington, and that I have been fighting the fight from the beginning of this scandal.  </p>
<p>More importantly, I did not remove the thread. I am simply providing a reasonable explanation for its removal and suggested we continue to look in to this lead independently.</p>
<p>Please continue to dig, I think this could be a HUGE lead, we just need to be extremely careful for the integrity of this sub.</p></p>

<p><p>u/pizzathrowaway777 started this sub, and through sheer will kept it alive despite a clear push from the organizations you listed to misdirect and discredit this investigation.

<p><p>Of course the cp link needed to be removed, but labeling the rest of it likely hoax, especially after the website went down. As well as deleting my post, which was just a link to the down website, seems odd. </p></p>

<p><p>Agreed.  I think the other mods are extra scared of threatening the integrity of the sub and are reacting more quickly, and extremely than necessary.  That being said people helping with this investigation getting caught in a honeypot would be bad for the legitimacy of our work.</p></p>

<p><p>I guess so, we do have to be careful, but given the area we're dealing with any evidence we find could put us in danger, I think we need to come up with a procedure to follow if someone finds evidence that could be CP, and put in the sidebar.</p></p>

<p><p>To play devil's advocate: it needed to be removed and processed differently if anyone is to take the guy seriously. If you click on the CP he provided, you're probably going to prison and now they have all of your info logged by the FBI and every other alphabet agency. Providing a link to actual CP was not a way to go about what he did. He never should've provided that link. If he was legit, the "prices.pdf" is what should've come out first. It smelled way too much like a honeypot and was way too dangerous to leave that thread up as it was. OP should've come at it very differently. The safety of every redditor who clicked on his links is now in <em>extreme</em> jeopardy.</p></p>

<p><p>Eh if I was a mod here and saw a thread that looked like it was going to put my users in extreme danger of going to prison, I probably would've removed it as well. They had a tough call to make between allowing something to stay up that could legitimately put innocent people in prison or take it down and avoid that kind of trouble all together. If the WeThePizza OP was serious and <em>really</em> wanted to investigate that place then he's probably more than welcome to make a new thread and not put up a link that could put people in prison and release the info in a safer way.</p></p>

<p>It's not possible to do if the post is the one that starts the discussion chain. If it were posted as a comment on the OP instead of being edited into the OP itself, ONLY THEN could it be pruned selectively. If a post gets flagged as spam or removed it unilaterally becomes invisible to general users, as does every comment associated with it (beyond viewing parts of it from your comment history).</p>
<p>Moderators cannot selectively edit the content of self-text posts.</p></p>

<p>I think they have very sophisticated computer programs that prevent a lot of people from seeing a lot of stuff on the internet. It could be one of their ways of keeping congress and the public in the dark. </p></p>

<p><p>So it is time to post links to it on other websites. I like TruthDig and The Real News Network but they are not showing any interest at all in covering this explosive story. </p></p>
