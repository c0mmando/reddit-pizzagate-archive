<strong>Thoughts on How to Redpill More Effectively</strong>
<p><p>It's all good that we're researching and learning, but we need to get information out there to the people. We're all aware by now of the cognitive blocks, the <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SP1zMwyor4U/maxresdefault.jpg">chess game with satan</a> of trying to reach the minds of the "normies". The challenge is, of course, that the rules of the game are different with each person, depending on their background, biases, critical thinking skills, etc.</p>
<p>Even as we've been subdivided and put into cognitive boxes by the engineered "culture" of media, education, religion, etc... that makes it a bit more simple for us. Every person is NOT different -- they've been neatly sorted into a range of stereotypes or "archetypes", shall we say. Generally not 100% in one stereotype -- something like 60% liberal, 30% visual artist, 10% yoga practitioner -- but it's still a helpful simplification. We can use these stereotypes to cognitively reach people and communicate/meme more effectively.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Free-thinking, critical-thinking researcher</strong> -- should be pretty easy to reach with this information. Simply be consistent and accurate with your information, and careful with your logic. Trivium Method, basically. Just think ahead, don't give them info they're not ready for. And don't give em info their friends aren't ready for. Play chess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Right-wing partisan conservative</strong> - I've had good luck painting this as moral failings of the Clintons, as in "Look at the sick shit the Clintons are up to: http://theantiglobalist.com/eyes-wide-shut-suspected-pedophile-ring-exposed/". Ideally you'll have one or two friends that can confirm if need be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liberals/SJWs/LGBT</strong> - Mannnn this one's tough. There are so many cards stacked against you. They probably already think you're a "conspiracy theorist" or a right-winger or an asshole white male. The more in-grouping you can do, the better. If you can somehow redpill their friends or their cultural leader, that can be very effective. Need to first establish that the media is patently dishonest, perhaps frame it as a human rights issue - talk about US corporations raping Central/South America, etc. Slowly work up to it. Need help here. We badly need to redpill liberals!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>edit: More Liberal ideas from /u/wacopizza:</p>
<ul>
<li>"We have to take our party back from these people."</li>
<li>"This group only talks about progressive values to gain votes."</li>
<li>"Bernie would have won without intervention from Podesta/Clintons."</li>
</ul>
<p>Another:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Guess we figured out why Bernie fell in line after being robbed of the nomination."</li>
</ul>
<p>Just some ideas, curious to hear others'!</p>
<p>MAJOR PROBLEM:</p>
<p>Facebook (and maybe Twitter?) appears to be cognitively dividing us. So basically only the people who know about this are gonna hear about it. Your liberal friends almost certainly have it filtered out. Need somebody with a liberal FB account to perform testing.</p>
<p>Also, Google is quashing Trends, at least. They may be shaping searches as well. (Use multiple search engines for your own research.) This will slow the spread of information.</p></p>
