<strong>Suggestion regarding Pizzagate locations of interest. Map Out These Hot Spots.</strong>
<p><p>I'm thinking if we already have a good idea where these people operate we could mark these locations (a dot) on a world map, which I am hoping shows possible flight patterns (assuming the airports nearby can lead to our areas of interest) that would in turn reveal a possible "slave trade" route. I would imagine they are organized like this. It probably would be easier to start local mapping in DC starting from Comet's Ping Pong. We start from there and the locations found in all our other evidence. For instance we have Haiti and DC, which for sure something is going on there. From what I am reading it also seems like these connections branch out to other countries. We also have cities well known for the sex trade that we could mark on the map like Bangkok. I do recall, Bill Clinton has been there before (not that it necessarily means anything, but worth a look imo), for some energy conference. </p></p>
