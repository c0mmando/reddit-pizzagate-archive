<p><p>LEGAL REASONS </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Why don't you be a man and stand up and name names and stop hiding and being a coward?" I have to deal with that, which is not pleasant, especially given the fact that I would love to name names. I'd love to be the first to do it. But unfortunately California conveniently enough has a statute of limitations that prevents that from happening. Because if I were to go and mention anybody's name I would be the one that would be in legal problems and I'm the one that would be sued.</p>

<p><p>I saw this quote a while ago and thought that if I were him I could just come forward.  In light of all this shit that has come up... The entire DOJ is involved... yes I can see how he would assume that he would be the one with legal problems.</p></p>

<p><p>Not known if it's tied to the current stuff we are looking into. Just because pedophile rings exist elsewhere does not mean they are all connected. Wait till evidence shows that there is something there.  </p></p>

<p><p>Look up Brock Pierce. He was part of a 90's Hollywood pedo ring and currently works for Clinton Global Initiative </p></p>
