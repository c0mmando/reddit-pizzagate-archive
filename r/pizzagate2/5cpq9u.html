<strong>[COULD BE NEW LEADS/MORE PROOF]Went to IG and looked for pictures at Comet Ping Pong, went into a bit of a rabbit hole and found some wierd stuff</strong>
<p><p>So at first I found this IG account called: SashaLordPresents which contains tons of posters for comet ping pong
Account: https://www.instagram.com/sashalordpresents/ archive:http://archive.is/ama6z</p>
<p>Notice that ALL of those wierd posters have "all ages" on them</p>
<ul>

in this one you can see the "little boy lover" logo a couple times (https://wikileaks.org/wiki/FBI_pedophile_symbols)

((I searched for CRYPTO JOCKS on google and came across THIS:https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fantasy-world-vol-3-dc-impalers-atx-red-death-witch-trial-tickets-28931881035?aff=erelexpmlt
It has an adress which is LITERALLY NEXT TO COMET PING PONG : https://www.google.co.il/maps/place/Washington,+DC+20011,+USA/@38.9513209,-77.0546519,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7c86e3d8f7d13:0xec436eea5b9a2d2b!8m2!3d38.9502497!4d-77.0161436 holy shit
archive:http://archive.is/Xt4ba no idea if its only for me but i cant see the picture itself in the archive))

 EDIT: Also from my other post which I took a screencap I found this wierd poster: http://imgur.com/XRDle8i you can also see there a necklace, a symbol for prostitution and some other wierd stuff, oh and of course the "all ages"</li>
</ul>
<h2>There are a lot more there if you want to dig yourself but those are some of the wierdest I've seen</h2>
<p>On one of this accounts pictures I looked at who liked a certain strange post and came across this:https://www.instagram.com/notorious<strong>bec/?hl=en account with a really disturbing profile pic, there I found THIS POST:https://www.instagram.com/p/BDYV0o3KRrk/?taken-by=notorious</strong>bec&amp;hl=en archive: http://archive.is/I7Z9C
it's the exact opposite of the comet ping pong logo:https://www.google.co.il/search?q=comet+ping+pong&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc5I2e26XQAhWM7xQKHXn-CtoQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=794#imgrc=iwJynpoaupvYHM%3A 
And it's filled with the "Little Boy Lover" symbol
Also there's a golden necklace in there, in the FBI website you can see some sorts of jewlery has something to do with pedos. Also on the post with the picture of the man hugging a baby with a necklace someone explained what it means but I can't find it right now.
I'll try to look later for more</p></p>

<p><p>I don't think the Sasha Lord posters will give much. They fit theming and stuff often but rarely are they damning.</p></p>

<p><p>Plenty of illuminati symbolism in the images, especially with the third eye and satanism stuff but still no real smoking gun.We may only find this smoking gun now via the deep web or with boots on the ground, either in Hawaii checking out the Flintstone location or in D.C. underground.</p></p>

<p><p>Not trying to discredit at all, but "all ages" is very common on flyers for local shows (especially when they're punk or alternative type shows. Hipster stuff).</p></p>

<p><p>Yea I know but my point is that some of the posters are pretty inappropriate. There are still many posts from the IG i didnt post here, you can look for yourself and see.</p></p>

<p><p>Once again, weird to you isn't exactly weird to punks or hipsters. But since she is connected to comet pizza and all these people, and since she seems to use certain symbols, it's definitely suspicious. </p>
<p>Like I said, I'm not trying to discredit your point at all. But a lot of people might draw the conclusions that I'm proposing</p></p>

<p><p>Yea I get you, but I don't only mean "wierd" symbols, I also mean some that are simply inappropriate like panties with hearts next to an "all ages". also i still think this is pretty wierd and especially the address: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fantasy-world-vol-3-dc-impalers-atx-red-death-witch-trial-tickets-28931881035?aff=erelexpmlt
oh yea and I really shouldn't have written "more proof" I just wanted to give more evidence to the people</p></p>

<p><p>The one that looks like a mirrored image of comet ping pong logo with pedo symbols is the wierdest to me honestly</p></p>

<p><p>Every spiral is not pado logo. Look for other contexts. A single post with drawings does not form a valid basis for being suspicious. </p></p>
