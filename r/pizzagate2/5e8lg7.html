<p><p>Are you serious? Is this really all it takes to be implicated in something so disgusting and heinous? Actually, is there any room in anybody's mind here to consider the possibility that a lot of this stuff isn't what it looks like?</p>
<p>Do you guys think anybody actually <strong><em>works</em></strong>? Does anyone have any time to actually govern or do their jobs? Or is literally everyone just fucking children 24/7?</p>
<p>Look at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cqi6e/ive_found_the_origin_and_story_of_pizzajpg/?">this thread</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e7v8j/breaking_evidence_in_clinton_email_nude_members/">this thread</a>.</p>
<p>So Hillary went to rescue hostages and then they took a picture of them eating pizza with one of the women's daughter. Set aside your views on the woman herself for a second. Knowing what you know now about thread 1, is there <strong><em>anything at all</em></strong> worth considering as relevant in thread 2? There's no connection the movie detailed there, at all. The photo attached is sharing a moment that, within the context of the information in thread 1, is heartwarming. It's not evidence of pedophilia. There needs to be more critical thinking and scrutiny applied like this to other evidence. <strong>You can't just go around calling everyone pedophiles.</strong></p></p>

<p><p>"You can't just go around calling everyone pedophiles."</p>
<p>Can you explain the code words in Podesta's emails? 
How about the Jeffery Dahmer artwork?
The ridiculously close resemblance of Johnny and Tony as suspects in McCann's abduction in Portugal, and they happened to be in Portugal staying with a Pedo at the time. Can you explain this? 
The countless links between Clintons, Podesta and Epstein. Explain? </p>
<p>Until some of these major points are put to rest, anyone has the right to be suspicious of malicious intentions. </p></p>

<p><p>EDIT: I'm being downvoted and I didn't even disagree with anything necessarily, just applied a little scrutiny and asked some valuable questions to counterbalance the extreme viewpoints and conclusion jumping.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you explain the code words in Podesta's emails?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the problem. You've already made up your mind that it's code. It could be, but you don't know. I agree it's odd, and I've already said I think there's something there. I can't explain it, but neither can you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How about the Jeffery Dahmer artwork?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See, this is the Christian moralistic sensibility. What exactly does an interest in Jefferey Dahmer mean in relation to these e-mails? You don't know anything about John Podesta, or why he may have been inspired by Jefferey Dahmer for that piece. The article that showcases the piece doesn't even mention Jefferey Dahmer, or how the pose was selected, or if Podesta himself chose the pose. He may have, but <em>you don't know!</em> If he was running for office you might be able to smear his image with this stuff, but he's not. This amounts to judgment against a person doing things that you either don't understand or don't like. This is not evidence.</p>

<p>I've seen multiple posts saying different things. Some have said that it was originally two interpretations of the same person, and some that have said that some reports later implicated 2 suspects instead of 1 like originally. That doesn't mean those drawings retroactively represented two different people. If there was later found to be another person involved in the McCann disappearance and they drew another picture, that would be one thing, but nobody knows! Not one person has been able to point to a single source that goes in-depth about how the drawings of the suspect(s) came to be. That may be because this case happened over a decade ago. If you're going to request that Portuguese law enforcement re-open the case, or if someone actually requests documents related to the case, you might have something worth talking about. As of right now, it's irrelevant. It has nothing to do with John Podesta being asked about something in code 7 years later in an e-mail. Stop it.</p></p>

<p><p>I don't think it's weird. I'm an atheist. I'd like to know what the motivation was, for sure, especially in relation to any of this. I'm not gonna shame the guy for it just offhand, though -- especially if there's just nothing there in relation to any criminal sexual deviancy he might partake in. John Podesta might be a pedophile, honest to god. I've seen enough to get curious about that, but I'm not jumping to conclusions.</p>
<p>The idea of avoiding a subject matter because it's weird or taboo is supposed to be what we're trying to overcome, is it not?</p></p>

<p><p>I think you're right in a lot of respects. People are confusing pizzagate (such a ridiculous name) and the twitter thing. They're not the same. What was uncovered on twitter COULD have some links but not too closely. As much as I hate politicians, I'm sure not all of them are abusing kids. Too many ppl with too much time on their hands makes for some ridiculous thoughts and ideas. Read here today that someone should take a sample of Podesta's faeces and test it for human remains! These fucking morons are detracting from real issues because we all know what 'ordinary' folks think. Too much information is being over analysed to the point where people are finding such tenuous (so stretched its at breaking point) links that they think they've found irrefutable evidence when it's just utter, utter bullshit. </p></p>

<p><p>Actually, Hillary did not go rescue hostages—Bill did. He also did it completely on his own accord, and went to get these "journalists" who decided to head to the China-N. Korean border to cover human trafficking. </p>

<p><p>My bad, I just saw that the OP from the first thread quoted that "Clinton made the trip in August 2009, after Laura and Euna had spent 140 days in captivity, and helped secure their release."</p>
<p>Anyway, may I ask what your point is? Are you saying they're not real journalists? I don't smell anything fishy there, at all.</p>
<p>Euna Lee has a twitter - https://twitter.com/lee_euna.</p>
<p>So does Laura Ling - https://twitter.com/lauraling. </p>
<p>If you're so inclined, you can go and "investigate" them, but I think you're wasting your time. There's still nothing connecting them or her daughter to pedophilia or child sex rings.</p></p>

<p><p><em>sigh</em> That was completely irrelevant to my point. Whether it was Bill or Hillary Clinton has nothing to do with the fact that the girl in the photo with her mother and the other woman eating pizza is not</p>
<p>a) "Breaking evidence in Clinton email"</p>
<p>b) A "nude members only ping pong club video"</p>
<p>c) Or "a child and a pizza surrounded by two creepy looking women eating pizza sent around people within the Clinton campaign" -- FUCKING SERIOUSLY? What is that judgment based on except the fact that the OP had NO CONTEXT and drew a conclusion based on nothing except their being completely convinced that the narrative here is completely incapable of or in need of being criticized.</p>
<p>If the standard isn't raised here -- scratch that, it is already too late. This place is a clusterfuck.</p></p>

<p><p>Yes—some of the titles are outlandish, but even if they are, it can lead to something unexpected and helpful.  That pic of those two girls may be nothing, but when I found them I also never made absurd claims because there was no proof. However, it led me to stronger circumstantial evidence that became strong focal points in the sub. </p>
<p>This is simple crowdsourcing, dude. What the fuck do you expect for a standard—everyone in here to have a fucking Master's/PhD? There are good researchers and bad researchers here, but this "clusterfuck" of a sub is far from nothing.  </p>
<p>If you have a problem with these threads, why are you even still here? Take the tin foil hat off if you don't like it instead of bashing. </p></p>

<p><p>Hey, you don't have to take my very level-headed and calmly presented opinion seriously. My ultimate point is that nobody is going to take this place seriously -- the "MSM" included -- if things aren't reigned in. That's not going to happen though, because any attempt to do so is met with accusations of (i'm laughing now) being paid to shill or being part of some massive government coverup attempt to do what 90% of this sub is doing for itself (discredit).</p></p>

<p><p>The problem with it being a "level-headed and calmly presented opinion" is that you don't even know what word "implicated" was in relation to.  You automatically suspected hardcore pedo shit without even thinking that the comment might be in relation to a coverup.  </p>
<p>I don't think every single person is involved here with pedo, but do I think there are certain groups trying to cover this up—yes.  It's not outlandish to think that the NYT is trying to coverup/bury this story when:</p>
<p>(1)  there is no mention of the weird paintings at the pizza place and the pics on the owner's IG account along with the comments; </p>
<p>(2) the majority shareholder in the NYT is a major contributor to the Clintons and their foundation; and </p>
<p>(3) powerful DC politicians are linked to the pizza place via emails. </p>
<p>Maybe NYT knows maybe they don't—you may be right—but the article is a shitty "nothing to see here" piece and it deserves to be treated as such. </p></p>

<p>Irrelevant to my point. The problem comes in when any dissent or disagreement (or even just <em>not</em> automatically assuming you're correct) is expressed and nobody is even willing to consider your confirmation bias is giving you a witch hunt mentality. What I've seen is that literally anyone who has breathed the same air as John Alefantis or John Podesta is apparently in on this to some degree. Or even anyone that's had any kind of monetary connection, period. Like literally it's just an entrance fee separating anyone from being let in on the child rape.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) there is no mention of the weird paintings at the pizza place and the pics on the owner's IG account along with the comments;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See, this is not how serious journalism works. You don't just see weird paintings and start shaming people. Weird paintings are not suspicious or worthy of report. Actually they're not evidence of anything. In connection with even the most <em>solid</em> bit of evidence connected to CPP, it's circumstantial and unworthy of directly implicating Alefantis in <em>anything</em>, much less a hit piece about his taste in art. Actually, only conservative blogs are picking this up, aren't they? Curious how this is really just turning out to be a hit on the reputations of prominent anybody liberal. That's confirmation bias. If you weren't already so convinced the world was trying to keep you down, you wouldn't be so quick to jump to this conclusion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) the majority shareholder in the NYT is a major contributor to the Clintons and their foundation; and</p>

<p>Not saying this is wrong to be suspect about, but it also doesn't prove anything. Is he a pedophile? Has he ever been accused of child abuse? This is a dead end. Just because you gave money to people doesn't mean you're automatically going to support everything they do. Let's even consider for a second the notion that the CF is some kind of protection organization a la the mafia. What's his thing? And why would that suddenly make him OK with the potentiality that someone whose foundation he donated to at some point's chief of staff might be friends with/raping kids with a DC socialite/business owner? That's bad fucking news. This literally only works if you're already 100% convinced that the only thing the Clintons do is rape kids, murder people, and then let everyone that slips them a coin in on it too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(3) powerful DC politicians are linked to the pizza place via emails.</p>

<p>That's public record. He's listed as the 49th most  whatever in DC right? That's not nefarious. Politics is a game, and people know each other in D.C. It doesn't have to be anything more than doing good community work, spending with and on the right people and causes, and staying in good graces with the right people. That's not corruption, dude, that's politics.</p></p>

<p><p>Just like you can't go around calling everyone pedophiles, you can't take 23,000 people and assume everyone's approach and agenda is the same as the few you cherry picked.</p>
<p>A lot of people are just hearing about this and seeing bits and pieces for the first time and reading conflicting things. There's a lot of confusion.  Some people aren't good at critical thinking, some are bringing massive amounts of confirmation bias to the table, some are gullible as hell, etc etc etc.  </p>
<p>Down vote and dismiss the absurd connections, up vote the ones that are worth further investigation.</p></p>

<p><p>Don't necessarily disagree, but it's already too late. The mob rule unfortunately isn't erring on the side of caution so there's already an overwhelming breakdown in quality and there'll continue to be. This stopped being about uncovering pedophilia and child abuse and got folded into alt-right racist and anti-semitic bullshit a while ago. Now it's about "red pilling" people and mistrusting all authority like we're teen rebels. </p></p>

<p><p>That's no different than what's been going on with politics since the beginning of time.<br/>
The real story here is the massive pedophilia/trafficking that seems to run rampant, and how closely tied many of these people are to children's organizations/institutions.  A lot of this stuff might be bullshit revolving around pizza places, but there's a real story in the middle of this that shouldn't get lost because a small subset of people believe every pizza place is a front for human trafficking.</p>
<p>That would be like saying liberal/conservative ideologies are bunk because of their fringe elements that don't represent the majority.  There's still something important going on.</p></p>

<p><p>Totally agree, but there's a reason a lot of people can't take this seriously, and why it tends to fit into a worldview that people with conservative leanings tend to have. The conservative lean doesn't invalidate that something might actually be there, but the extremism present is what's preventing this from being picked up by any major news source.</p></p>

<p><p>I didn't make up my mind until I went and looked at the emails. The strongest link  to convince me that there was any smoke at all to this was Abramovic emails with the Podestas. They emailed about "spirit cooking" with her and arranged for visits to each other's houses by email, in wikileaks. Add in the Moloch reference pics with 14 and fish on Podesta's bandaided hands, and you have a strong connection.</p>
<p>The real "wtf" moment was the owner of Comic Ping Pong's instagram pics. He uses direct pedophilia terms that you have to look up. How else is a 2 year old boy a "#chickenlover?" </p>
<p>How is an "Sex" an "all ages" Sasha Lord event? What "all ages" pizza places have disembodied heads as art, and art modified so the males jacking off with a giant white spray? HOW IS THIS KID SAFE?  </p></p>

<p><p>I wanna offer some perspective.</p>
<p>I think this article is very reasonable. Probably more reasonable than is deserved. Look, I think some people (I'll address you in a second) here might be quick to call this "one-sided" or believe it to be lacking in "detail" and since it doesn't fit the dominant narrative here, will dismiss it outright. I think a lot of people will agree with that view because, again, it fits into the dominant narrative. I want to say that I disagree and want y'all to consider some things.</p>
<p>This article only details what can be proven, which is that people have been sending death threats, posting and reposting pictures of other people's children without their knowledge or permission (and, again, opening them up for more harassment, exposure to other pedophiles, and then automatically associating them with fucking child porn when their pictures are seen on the internet), harassing people that are definitively unable to be connected to any elite pedophile ring in existence in any concrete sense. It's being done based on what amounts to a lot of circumstantial evidence and with "investigations" being conducted by amateurs largely without any appreciable standard for what evidence they will and will not consider and with absolutely no compass or sense of direction outside of scrutinizing any Democrat/Liberal that's ever eaten pizza or played ping pong... ever. Oh, and "elites".</p>
<p>Nowhere in this article are any of the prominent sources that many people here have been using as their primary news sources (i.e. Vigilant Citizen) called "fake news sites". Conservative-leaning blogs are labeled as such, there's no particular lean I can detect. There's just facts. People are being harassed, and threatened, and there's really not shit to show for it being justified as more than slander.</p>
<p>I think this article is what journalism and proper research looks like, and I would like you (reader) to consider that it's very fair given the reality of the nature of how many directly and indirectly involved with the research and investigation have taken to expressing their views and feelings about what may be happening.</p>
<p>In contrast, sites like Vigilant Citizen appear to have much lower standards for their "journalism". We haven't proven a single thing here, period. But the way that <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/pizzagate-4chan-uncovered-sick-world-washingtons-occult-elite/">this article</a> is presented is incredibly unprofessional and plays into a very particular worldview that, for whatever reason, is filtered through a Christian moralistic sensibility. Furthermore, you'd think that was the end of it, that the case was solved, and there's nothing more to be questioned.</p>
<p>I think that's dangerous, very unhealthy, and leaves anyone who isn't willing to think a little more critically about these things incredibly open to manipulation. Look at the way these thread titles are being written, guys. All caps, multiple exclamation points, some of them being quite misleadingly titled for the purpose of catching eyes like this is a clickbait news site. It's hysterical and not a little embarrassing. This place is like a cult of its own. If you attempt to step outside of the hysteria and offer an alternative interpretation of ANYTHING, you're labeled a shill, a disinformation agent, or both. Consider how easy it would be to troll people like that just for shits and giggles. Also consider how one-sided this whole thing is, as if Democrats are the only ones deserving of scrutiny. True, there's only Democratic e-mails that have been leaked, but there are conservatives and Republicans who are equally likely to be in some fucked up shit and hiding it, but in all this hysteria, I haven't seen a single attempt to broaden the view of corruption in US politics beyond that which the Democrats are responsible for. Think about that for a second, and ask yourself why that is, if this is about children. Consider who stands to benefit. </p>
<p>I don't even wanna get into how poor the standards here because it would eat up my whole fucking night, but look at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e7v8j/breaking_evidence_in_clinton_email_nude_members/">this thread</a>. The title is "Breaking evidence in Clinton email - nude members only ping pong club video". </p>
<p>First, I'm personally so sick of the word breaking here. Not everything is breaking. But the thread's title is such an exaggeration of what's actually presented, it actually hurts my head. It isn't even true. There's no breaking evidence in the e-mail. It's pizza.jpg again. This has already been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cqi6e/ive_found_the_origin_and_story_of_pizzajpg/?">shown to be nothing</a>. Read it, then look at the first comment there. So it completely and utterly demolishes any negative interpretation of this e-mail. It's a beautiful moment that's being shared, and it calls the interpretation of the OP into question. Just because it's weird or you don't like/understand it doesn't mean there's criminal activity or abuse, and it's just nasty and intellectually dishonest to lobby accusations being a pedophilie and other equally egregious, vile things just because you don't like somebody or think they're weird.</p>
<p>You're probably not even reading this at this point (kind of proving my point about dissidence because I guarantee I'm gonna be called a shill), but if you take away anything from this post, it's that this place needs to get its shit together or this is going nowhere. Personally, I already think it's too late. We're not in a cartoon, we're not in a movie. If something is going on, these people are not just going to keep doing it now that people may have brushed past probably the only concrete evidence we have that something MAY be amiss with the people initially instigated in all this (the e-mails). They are going to clean house, and stay the fuck low, because these aren't just "global elites", these are people with reputations on the line. Careers. Lives. I guarantee you that they're not looking here, though. They don't need to, and there's literally no need to expend energy to counteract much of this, because you're all doing the legwork of discrediting yourselves.</p>
<p>EDIT: And because I KNOW this is going to be a point that some individual is going to highlight to dismiss my entire reply, yes my account is new. It's a throwaway. I'm a relatively active redditor otherwise. No offense, but a lot of people are gawking at this because it's curious and interesting, but it's also really embarrassing how a lot of people are conducting themselves here and at least in my case, I don't want to be associated with the nuttiness. I can't even show my friends this place as much as I appreciate the more substantial evidence being uncovered (secret logins, portals with possibly massive files on a pizza website, weird reactions from pizza shops under scrutiny).</p></p>

<p><p>The article falsely portrayed pizzagate as focusing on Hillary Clinton when most of the focus has been on strange things connected to the Podesta brothers. The article repeated the claims that it was unjustified for people to take pictures of children off Instragram while making no mention of what was in those pictures. For example a young girl restrained with tape to a table in the restaurant. Another child being held by a man while the restaurant owner commented "Chicken lovers" which is a slang term for adult gay men who are attracted to children. Babies sucking on thousands of dollars worth of Euros. Pictures of baby coffins. Calling an infant a "Hotard" slang for a ho who is retarded. Pictures of a baby doll with its mouth open and a sign suggesting it's a real baby for sale. The weird stuff is not being imagined. </p>
<p>The article misrepresents, ignores and minimizes things that most people would find incredibly strange. The article makes no mention of the huge pedophile rings discovered in other countries with ties to the political class. It makes no mention of the accusations of child molestation in gay Hollywood circles. For example the Bryan Singer accusations. All it does is ridicule people here who are justifiably concerned. </p>
<p>I disagree with you that if this is true that the people will stop, I think it's a compulsion. </p>
<p>The more attention it gets the more pressure there is on the government to investigate. </p></p>

<p><p>Just because you think it's weird or looks one way doesn't mean that you have the right to slander people and call them pedophiles. This is what I meant by things being filtered through a Christian moralistic viewpoint. That shit might be weird, but maybe Alefantis is just a hipster. I actually think that's more likely what's up with that one. </p>
<p>Anyway, as far as how Pizzagate is represented in this article: I don't think you or anyone else here has presented anything that, at this point in time, any serious journalist worth their salt would touch at all, certainly nothing worth risking reputations on by accusing people of literally raping children. There's weird shit, and as mostly just regular people and amateur sleuths, there's a justification for looking into these things if you're concerned, but consider how fucking wacky this place is and maybe you'll see the reason why real news organizations aren't hopping all over this. The imperative to focus less on the potential occult shit mixed in here went beyond just keeping focus. This is now just more conspiracy bullshit without any sense of ethics, a loose grounding on reality (sadly), and until something concrete and less circumstantial, that goes beyond just "that's interesting/weird/creepy", that actually implicates somebody criminally is uncovered -- this is dead.</p>
<p>That said, I fully believe people with real investigative chops and the proper resources to look into this properly are doing so away from the madness. That might even include actual law enforcement, like federal law enforcement because these are serious, serious accusations. I don't think everyone is corrupt or raping children.</p></p>

<p><p>I haven't slandered anyone. You certainly seem to be slandering everyone here and painting them all with a broad brush. Sure, he might just be weird but considering his powerful ties in DC I want to know more about how weird he is. </p>
<p>I hope the government is looking into it but as we have seen from similar situations in other countries no one in power seemed to take these sorts of accusations very seriously. If you look at the professional investigations overseas you see a pattern of incompetence by those police, intentional or not. I'm glad people are as up in arms about this as they are. It beats the alternative which is passive disinterest. </p>
<p>Have you researched the Marc Collins-Rector, Bryan Singer stuff at all? </p></p>

<p>That position is a lot less common here than it should be. It's a lot more rational of a position than basically almost anyone else here has presented. Yourself, even. You say they're implicated, or that upper management is implicated, but you say that based on... nothing. Just that they're not mentioning other events that may or may not be related to John Podesta and others in DC raping and murdering children. </p>
<p>You can say it, for sure, but that attitude that goes from "someone disagrees" to "they're covering this up and censoring us" without really any sort of rational thought process in between is what's driving some really gullible people to say and do some really dumb shit. Hint, that's what's driving journalists away from this. Literally this would be the story of the fucking century, but it's not there yet.</p>
<p>There are people making death threats and have already made their minds up about anyone who's ever breathed the same air as James Alefantis and accusing him of something incredibly serious but totally without much merit right now. I actually feel sorry for the guy at this point because it can't be good for business, but there's only so much damage control he can do when people are so vehemently convinced based on... Literally almost nothing.</p></p>

<p><p>I don't think the media is interested in uncovering the truth unless it can hurt someone on the right. We just went through an election that showed the extent the media, particularly the NYT, carries water for the DNC and the Clintons. If they aren't investigating this I highly doubt it's because of users here rather than the media's own form of political tribalism. </p>
<p>Very good article on how little the media cares about investigative journalism..,</p>

<p><p>So why isn't Politico investigating this or running an article then? Are they compromised too? Honestly, I almost got caught up in this hysteria about corruption and cover ups and how literally nobody can be trusted but after seeing how people have been here, I'm definitely going to be applying a much, much higher level of scrutiny to these claims.</p></p>

<p><p>Of course you are. That's your confirmation bias at work. Notice how not even Breitbart has picked this up. Nor has Fox News. Not the New York Post. Are they all implicated, too? Are they suspicious? Controlled by Jews, too, goyim? jesus fucking christ lmao</p></p>

<p><p>No, it's being a news junky and observing for the pass 18 months how the media has operated. You're trying to use accusations of racism to belittle my reasonable explanation that people don't trust the media due to the media having a well known bias for the left, the media doing practically zero investigative pieces and the obvious distortions of the story in this piece.</p>
<p>The fact you're implying I'm anti-Semitic is a personal attack. </p></p>

<p><p>Is there one place where one can see these photos so that the casual person who came here after reading the NYTimes can get the other side of the story? I have an open mind but I have looked at several posts on this sub slamming the piece and mentioning the images without giving a single link.</p></p>

<p><p>Thanks for saying this. I mostly lurk on Reddit (go ahead and check my post history... you'll surely conclude that I'm an SJW but that's a whole different discussion), and I've taken an interest in pizzagate and the theories presented within. But, as someone who you might consider "mainstream" or even a lil poor sheeple, I want you to know that most of you look like complete nut bags. You can talk all you want about how the MSM is censoring this story, but the fact of the matter is you haven't given them anything worthy of reporting on. I think there's definitely something here. I'm not sure what it is, but I can tell you that, when the top comment of this thread is "Now we know they're implicated," I'm less likely to continue reading. Stick to the facts. Otherwise you just look like bored kids pretending to be PIs, and the story will sink before it's even begun its telling.</p>
<p>Take that for what it's worth... or just call me a shill (if that's your first impulse, please note that I am leaning toward agreeing with the premise of this subreddit...)</p></p>

<p><p>You say this sub is full of nut bags, but that there's definitely something here, and you don't know what it is. </p>
<p>The people in this sub, the people doing the digging and critical thinking and asking the questions -- they're courageous. They're doing a job that they know is going to make them sound like nut jobs to people like you, who can't fathom this to be true. But you said it yourself, it stinks. </p>
<p>Just because there's not a picture of Podesta fucking a kid yet, or a body found in a barrel doesn't discount the endless evidence that you yourself said is indicative of something very, very bad. We're not trying to investigate some ordinary ghetto murder or rape. This is systemic degeneracy, implicating very smart, careful people in the highest levels of power. If this case breaks, it's going to be world-changing -- and that's the only reason why it may not. There may be too much to lose if what looks like a duck and sounds like a duck turns out to be a duck.</p></p>

<p><p>The nutbaggery is not in the premise, it's in the wild conclusions it seems like most of the users are willing to jump to. It's critical thinking that disallows people like me to take a lot of this seriously. It's my own research into the satanic panic of the 90's that raises many red flags about the extremely tenuous links many users here are ready to accept as solid evidence for satanic ritual abuse.</p>
<p>I can fathom the premise of this subreddit to be true. Child sex trafficking exists, and history shows us that those who are in power are willing to do anything to stay in power and expand upon it. I'm doing my best to read through the information presented here, but the hysterics with which it is presented does nobody any good. All I suggested in my post is people stick to the facts. Saying the NYT is implicit in a pedophile ring because they've taken the stance that a guy who owns a pizza shop and some weird art should not be receiving death threats is ridiculous.</p></p>

<p>You really need to review this sidebar post. Without even reading the whole thing, just look at the Alefantis Instagram posts that he took down. I look at his smiling face in the NYT and the assertion that everyone here is just a tinfoil-hatwearing kook, and then I look at picture after picture of children taped to tables, in compromising positions -- just fucked up, irrefutable degeneracy, and I can't fathom how anyone could write a puff piece for that place with a straight face. </p></p>

<p><p>I've read all the information in the sidebar. The idea that a picture of a young girl with her hands taped to a table is proof of pedophilia is absurd. Teachers used to tape kids hands down to tables because they couldn't sit still. Sure, that's fucked up, but it doesn't mean the teacher raped them. A guy who own a pizza shop could post that with this message in mind: "Come enjoy some pizza while your kids have their hands full playing ping pong" or whatever other forms of family entertainment the place offers. It's clear that he has a twisted sense of humor, it's not clear that he's engaged in satanic ritual children rape/sacrifice.  </p></p>

<p><p>From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are at a dangerous place in American culture where a good percentage of people aren’t distinguishing what is a real news source based on real reporting and fact-checking and only <strong>reinforcing pre-existing ideas they have</strong>,” Ms. Kleinman said.</p>
<p><strong>The frustration has been compounded by the lack of recourse for Mr. Alefantis, his friends and employees</strong>. Yelp blocked the comments sections of Comet Ping Pong’s review page after reports of abusive comments and fake news in reviews. YouTube said it prohibits threats, harassment and hate speech and has tools for flagging violations and filing complaints for the site to take further action, but has largely not blocked comments on these videos. Twitter declined to comment, and Facebook did not have any further comment.</p>
<p>After employees and Mr. Alefantis complained to Reddit about how Comet Ping Pong was being targeted on the site, the #pizzagate discussion thread posted a warning that revealing personal information about individuals was prohibited.</p>
<p>“We know that we have more work to do and we take our responsibility to address online abuse seriously,” Reddit said in a statement.</p>
<p><strong>Little relief appears in sight. Over the weekend, Comet Ping Pong received dozens of calls from people screaming obscenities and threats. Mr. Alefantis got 50 nasty Instagram direct messages, including one that warned, “This place should be burned to the ground!”</strong></p>

<p><p>The article is just too neat and tidy. Looks like the author worked extremely hard to make this fit right into the Fake News narrative. It's almost as if this has been designed as a disposal plan.</p></p>
