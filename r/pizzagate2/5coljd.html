<p><p>Why are all these article constantly calling us "Alt-right trump supporters". I voted hillary (as shitty as that sounds) because I'm a liberal, but who I voted for shouldn't even fucking matter when it comes down to uncovering a state sponsored pedophile ring. Im a US citizen, and it would bother me equally if the conspiracy was rooted in the GOP instead of the DNC. IMO this is something that crosses party lines. It shouldn't even matter anyways now that the election is over. I see it as the media being bought out and trying to defame anybody trying to topple these corrupt elitists.</p></p>

<p><p>Exactly. Democrat. Republican. Independent. Green Party. It doesn't matter who you are... diddling kids is not an okay thing to do. </p>
<p>It makes no sense to me how the richest people in the world, who can do pretty much anything they want, and they wanna diddle little kids. </p>
<p>What the fuck. </p></p>

<p><p>What a piss poor excuse for an article. These attempts to "debunk" the evidence don't address any of the details -- none. They are totally unworthy of discussion and nobody will fall for it. </p></p>

<p><p>What a terrible article. No research, no contacting Afelantis, no contacting Comet Ping Pong, just loads of shill names calling. I swear liberals' morality is so twisted, they would prefer a pedophile child killer who supported Clinton than a law abiding and kind republican. Sick people.</p>
<p>PS I'm going to research the journalist Will Sommer and find out if he has any connection to the people or venue. He seems rather defensive??!</p></p>
