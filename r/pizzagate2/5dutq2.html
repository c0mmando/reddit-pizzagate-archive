<p><p>That's the one - then everyone seemed to forget this. OMH this is one of the strongest links we've found in the whole investigation. We need to find more hard links to his name.</p></p>

<p><p>Let's avoid posting personal info on him as we cannot afford for this info to get lost again. The info posted in that top link is public data - no personal info or addresses.</p>
<p>People - Don't forget HISTORICAL Whois lookups. Remember, the internet doesn't forget and most of the websites in question have have their whois data updated over all this over the past week or so. IMO, just another smoking gun!</p></p>

<p><p>If you read that guys comments, and then confirm for yourself, his name is exceedingly common in Ghana. Like Smith or Johnson in the states. We don't need a Reddit witch hunt here. </p>
<p>As someone else posted below, apparently he's also a basketball player. There's just too many people by that name for us to assume anything. </p></p>

<p><p>This has come up before and as mentioned elsewhere already, there are multiple people with this name. Can you please do more research to ensure you are implicating the correct people. It can really make or break this case. Too many false reports and people will just tune out.</p>
<p>Plus, getting the wrong person leads people down the wrong path and causes many other false connections to follow.</p>
<p>You could have the correct person. But we need to make sure.</p></p>

<p>Yes, I realize it is a very common name.</p>

<p><p>If someone here can pay for historical WHOIS on domaintools then we are likely to get far better data. Not only on besta, but the others.</p>
<p>We must rely on hard facts. Not just pictures on social media account. These don't really prove anything alone, although they may provide useful connections.</p></p>

<p><blockquote>
<p>This post was removed because I received these messages:</p>
<p>1) Hi, I'm messaging you concerning the hope of Guinea linking us to the Clintons article that was posted. The content of the article is false and it contains my personal information along with others. It is defamatory and illegal. I want to ask you guys to take it down because at the point I am fearing for my life with the comments on the page especially that they have access to my address. Please take it down before I file a lawsuit against Reddit.</p>
<p>2) This post contains personal information!! The woman referenced is a 21 year old student who is involved in a nonprofit, nothing more. I know her well and these accusations are ridiculous and unfounded. Her organization won the award from the Clinton foundation as she won several rounds of voting, and I voted for her in each of them. She is currently contacting the police as this is harassment. It is the wrong person. The man who owns the non-profit does not own the pizza place. This is harming the reputation of an organization dedicated to fighting against the cause you are supposedly rallying against. You have allowed false material to be published including the names and pictures of innocent hardworking people and their nonprofit and implying they somehow have a connection with child sexual trafficking.
Here's what we know:</p>
<p>1) It's been researched out in other subs both on /r/conspiracy and /r/the_donald that the owner of the business is Andrew Kline.</p>
<p>2) The graphic posted stated the owner as Ibrahima Diallo without any information at all on how that conclusion was drawn. Comments pointed to Diallo being listed on the domain registration. This was not enough.</p>
<p>3) No work was done to ensure this Diallo is the same Diallo. At least not anything that I could see on the post.</p>
<p>We have to be careful to do the proper research. This takes actual work. The post stayed up for quite some time with no real weight or additional digging being done. If someone can make a more direct link between Besta and Diallo, and then show in greater detail that the Besta Diallo is the same Diallo tied to Hope of Guinea please submit the post with more detail.</p>
<p>We want the same things as you and we need to work together. We have to uphold some kind of standard as to how this is done. Not every post removal is "omg we're being censored!!!" -- we have to cover our asses here.</p>

<p><p>The address and phone number In the OP's image is exactly how it is on the website. It's public knowledge and OP could have instead said if anyone wants to know the address and phone number they can go to hopeofguinea.org and scroll down to the bottom of the website. Just trying to understand what is and what is not allowed since public knowledge/publically available data seems to have it's meaning changed quite often. </p></p>

<p><p>Zero degrees here. Same location. Clinton link. WHOIS updates to mask owners! I doubt it's a coincidence.</p></p>
