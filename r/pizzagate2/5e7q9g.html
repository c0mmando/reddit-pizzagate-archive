<strong>We must contact Monica Peterson's Human Trafficking research boss because he has her research</strong>
<p><p>Her memorial service was streamed live and recording is available: </p>
<p>https://www.facebook.com/humantraffickingcenter/videos/10154126938121395/</p>
<p>Her boss/professor Claude d'Estree said (beginning 39:30 mark of the stream):</p>
<p>"(She) decided to take on one of the demagogues in the field of human trafficking."</p>
<p>"Produced a 110-page analysis of human trafficking in Haiti - 2 years of research."</p>
<p>"We were looking for someone who was smart enough and maybe brave enough to publish her work"</p>
<p>"I will continue to seek out and publish it for her"</p>
<p>"We are in a state of shock. We may never know what exactly happened to her"</p>
<p>Background: https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5dbdz9/i_found_a_smoking_gun_monica_petersen_found_dead/</p>
<p>Based on all the information I have so far, I believe her 110-page report was specifically on the Restavek system in Haiti.</p></p>

<p><p>Just be wary, he used to work in the US Attorney's Office in Washington. I'm not saying he's in on it but it's always those we don't suspect that are guilty, especially those that hold high office. </p></p>

<p><p>Caution is always good, but why would he mention her work at all in his remarks if that's true?</p></p>

<p><p>Well he probably is a good guy. I suppose I'm just suss on anyone that is an expert in child trafficking and used to work in a high government department after all we have learned. He might have other motives, though. After all he has a job to do and must be seen doing it.</p></p>

<p><p>Very fair. </p>
<p>I still believe fundamentally that while this behavior is widespread, it's also narrow. Thousands of people are or have been US attorneys, my guess is only a fraction, if any, are in on such things while a wider percentage of them know intuitively to avoid certain leads if they want to keep their jobs/careers, with the vast majority overall never seeing anything wrong happen. </p></p>

<p><p>Wow. Hey Twitter leadership, attempting to silence dissent looks way more incriminating than just letting the public criticism and speculation fly freely or even (gasp!) proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that these allegations aren't true. Cc: Facebook, Google, Reddit. </p></p>

<p><p>I'm sure he won't just hand over the research. With CTR around and all...</p></p>

<p><p>I'm not sure how that's going to work out; vaguely remember seeing on one of the FB screenshots where he (could have been someone else) told a girl to ignore the conspiracy theorists or something to that effect.</p></p>
