<strong>Eryn Lepp - Connection? GET IN HERE</strong>
<p><p>I feel not enough attention has been put on her. She was cc'd in the email to Podesta about the pizza hankerchief.</p>
<p>From what I gather she served overseas in Iraq as a Civil Affairs Seargent:</p>
<p>http://communitytable.parade.com/225844/barryyeoman/women-vets-a-battle-all-their-own/</p>
<p>Here is a description of the Civil Affairs branch:</p>
<p>"Help plan U.S. government interagency procedures for national or regional emergencies</p>
<p>Assist with civil-military planning and support</p>
<p>Coordinate military resources to support reconstitution or reconstruction activities</p>
<p>Support national disaster, defense or emergency assistance and response activities</p>
<p>Foster and maintain dialogue with civilian aid agencies and civilian relief and assistance organizations"</p>
<p>Upon returning, she graduated with a Political Science degree and found herself a comfy job in the Center for American Progress think tank:</p>
<p>http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/3212873</p>
<p>She served as an assistant to Podesta while he was in the white house and during her stint at the CAP:</p>
<p>http://equitablegrowth.org/person/eryn-sepp/</p>
<p>Which leads us to some very important questions:</p>
<p>Was she compromised while in Iraq, contributing to underhanded activities and the political science degree was a means for Podesta to bring her into the fold, officially?</p>
<p>I assume she is compromised, given that she was specifically cc'd with an email we all know gives off all sorts of the wrong vibe.</p>
<p>There is virtually no information that I could find on her, but maybe some more diligent 'pedes could contribute.</p></p>

<p><p>TITLE SHOULD BE SEPP!</p>
<p>If a mod could fix that'd be great.</p></p>
