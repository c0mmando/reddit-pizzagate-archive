<strong>Weiner Charges ???? Involvement???</strong>
<p><p>Does anyone have any info about Anthony Weiner ? Or can they make any better connections between him and pizzagate? 
* he has 2 instances of documented sexual behavior involving children...
-pic with his son
- extensive communication with the 15 yr old girl...
Both were well documented in media 
If he could be better connected to pizzagate or any of its major players- it might really help to move the story from the fringe to the mainstream...</p>
<p>Does anyone know if he will actually be facing charges related to his behavior? Or contents of his laptop? </p></p>

<p><p>If the supposed evidence warrants federal charges I wouldn't be surprised to see nothing happen until the Trump Administration takes the reins. We have been led to believe that the NYPD discovered damning files on Weiner's computer, but we can only speculate what those <em>may</em> include, and if they're evidence of criminal activity it could end up in any number of jurisdictions. </p>
<p>I'm cautiously optimistic that the subject of our collective investigation may get some traction then, too. This was an insanely contentious election that took place among a lot of murky decisions by DoJ/FBI. Who-- either pro-justice or pro-suppression-- wants to stick their neck out right now?</p>
<p>Maybe it can be done by the book beginning in January? If nothing happens I want to see motherfucking whistleblowers and leaks!</p></p>

<p><p>The thing that scares me most about January is the clinton kill list. Your crazy to think anybody with proof against them will make it to testify. </p></p>

<p><p>Au contrare... I think the Clintons need to worry about ending up on such a list... Also, I'd be willing to bet most people in a position to damage the Clintons are scrambling for "life insurance" just in case the hammer comes down under the new Administration. (Wishful thinking, probably.)</p></p>
