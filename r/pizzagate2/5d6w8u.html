<strong>The steganography pics</strong>
<p><p>Once those started being cracked this morning, it seems they started on the offensive.  Anyone have a link to further research of those?  Seems like there is contained something important </p>

<p><p>I don't think any of them have been steganalyzed with success.  There isn't some magic, catch-all steg software that will work for every embed method.  We are working on it though.</p></p>

<p><p>I wonder if all the people trying to do steganographic analysis of PNG files realize that PNGs are a compressed file type.  Steganographically encoded data may only be visible at the correct compression.  Most especially try the <em>uncompressed</em> version.</p></p>

<p><p>In the a.m. someone had used some method that he didn't immediately make available to everyone to somehow find text inpodestas pic files. It was a large wall of mixed chinese, Japanese,  korean, Arabic and other characters.  It contained very specific and very pertinent information precisely related to finances, organized crime and such albeit jumbled up and incoherent. However some of the specific words and names could not have been there by accident or fluke....very specific Asian names..financial institutions...technologies. .animals...charity organizations. . .there is no way that hecould have gotten those results without being into something major....then suddenly amod closed the thread with the comment like "this is ducking stupid" .. claimed it was because op had produced results merely by opening png in text... now that is fucking stupid. Very precise keywords... and on top of that, the op somehow got changed to some argumentative jive so no one can even see the results that were produced to decide for themselves.  Can anyone link to that wall of weird text that I'm referencing?  Is just gone now. Sub is compd </p>
<p>Edit: op was u/notjohnpodesta 
Can we get a check in?  Still alive buddy?</p></p>

<p><p>Still here. I removed my original posts content because the "MOD" shit on the information making the post completely one sided by locking the thread. I am surprised that no one questioned the mod despite the information that was out there. I am out of town from this morning. When I get back I can submit the info and the path I used the decode. I am leaving for DC tomorrow and will be there for 2 weeks. I will update ASAP. </p></p>

<p><p>Yea, when I saw that mod's ridiculous comment and that he locked your thread, I was really upset. I wanted to make a comment about it but of course no one could comment anymore. He had no jusitification to write what he did and to lock it - reddit is here for open discussion, and I hate seeing an incompetent mod destroy that. Don't sweat him dude. Even if it turns out to be nothing, at least you are making efforts towards the cause. And I'm sure 99% of the people here would love the opportunity to analyze and discuss what you found further. I've seen this same mod commenting on MANY posts claiming that the post was irrelevant when clearly there was some justification for them having posted. Funny thing about it, is I don't see him contributing ANYTHING useful to this case. All he does is makes pretentious comments, lock threads, and pushes people away. He's the one who is fucking stupid.</p></p>

<p><p>How about the fact that nothing in that thread was of any use and didn't provide any insight into anything. It would have been worthwhile if he had posted the method he used from the start AND shown that any of the contents actually lead to anything worthwhile.</p>
<p>But he didn't. He went off half-cocked with something.</p>
<p>This thread is also terrible because it's nothing but infighting.</p>
<p>I locked the thread because the discussion was going in circles. Just as this topic currently is.</p></p>

<p><p>Keywords that u/notjohnpodesta posted were much too specific to have been produced this way. How would many many legit names of people and ngo's be contained in the hex? I'm missing how you get to those names from the hex info you posted. The info he posted was not random.</p>
<p>Edit: I do agree however that notpodesta should post his method asap to help us move forward despite the resistance he met yesterday. The people who are genuinely interested outway  the "this is ducking stupid" peeps</p></p>

<p><p>The OP of the thread you are referring to took the unicode, converted it to Chinese.  Chinese, as you may have heard, has a ton of fucking words with multiple meanings so what you get is mumbo jumbo.</p></p>

<p><p>Ok, let me break this down for you.  All that is in EVERY "corrupt" PNG from the Podesta leaks are regular txt strings that show up in any PNG file.  PNG is a compressed image file.  In order to be recognized as a PNG, the file needs to contain "chunks" of .txt to render properly http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Chunks.html.  </p>
<p>The hex that notjohnpodesta found was these chunks of text.  Instead of converting the .png text he converted it to hex/unicode.  You can do this yourself with really any programming language as long as it contains a function to convert txt to hex.  Hell, if the PNG contained RGB data, WHICH IT DID NOT, you could even convert the RGB to hex.  </p>
<p>OP then took this hex string (which is actually just regular text associated with any PNG) and translated it to Chinese.  There is a hex designation for every Chinese character.  Chinese is a complex language, so when notjohnpodesta translated the Chinese to english it tried its best to come up with something.  That is the final text you saw.  Apparently he translated it into multiple languages, but the fact of the matter remains: you are asking a translator to translate unintelligible english, converted to hex, then converted to chinese, and then converting it back to English.</p>
<p>There are other issues as well... Why would a sophisticated global pedo ring simply try to hide something in plain site?  Any notjohnpodesta could simply convert it to hex and, gasp, find the secret message.  Any file can be converted to hex if it has txt or color information (pixel data, technically an array of digits).  Try it yourself.  This is not how modern steganography works.  While there are simplified methods for embedding an image within another image, any of these easy methods would have been already discovered through people simply guessing software to try.  In order to desteg an image file you need to know exactly how the image was embedded.  So you can either guess through 1000's of different software/methods, find one that works for multiple methods, or you can compare the proposed steg image, to the regular image (and you have to try to make them the same image "quality" which can be subjective depending on how you weight the elements of quality, and can be caused by compression) and try to determine how image features (color info, even non color info =0 color bit integers) changed between the two.  Unless the changes are extremely obvious (unlikely if you think the person embedding the image knows what they are doing) this is nearly impossible with only one image set.  You would need to create a model based on  a very large training set (larger than the amount of .jpg in the Podesta emails, from what I have tried) to backdoor your way in to understanding the steg method.  Only after determining the embed method could you attempt to discover the hidden image, and maybe it is not an image at all, but a text image, a number code, etc. with even another layer of information to decrypt.  </p>
<p>I hope you understand that it is very unlikely that a random person on the internet is going to have the skillset, let alone the tools, or TIME (this is really the rate limiting step), to simply take any image and magically steganalyze it in a matter of hours.  </p>
<p>Please continue to contribute to the investigation!  It behooves us all to be more skeptical of peoples methods for obtaining this information.  In order to be taken seriously, we need to establish a very very bullet-proof case based on peer-reviewed methods for information collection. </p>

<p><p>This thread is now hidden from the main board directory. This is turning into a nonconstructive dramafest. If another thread like this produces similarly purile infighting I'll have to mute everyone involved.</p>
<p>/u/notjohnpodesta/ had a habit of posting several immature leads that went nowhere while providing no specifics as to what he was pointing towards.</p>
<p>/u/DepressedExplorer is treading on thin ice.</p>
<p>Everyone needling him is as well.</p></p>

<p><p>u/DumbScribblyUnctious See he derails then deletes. And then you infer blame to me. Some of his threats to me last night were repulsive. Now another thread about thishas been detailed by the two of you. Same exact method you used on the other thread. Do you see how we could infer that you want this hidden for a reason? Could you please remove any posts from said user here in this thread? I will clean mycomments as well so we can get this back on track and hopefully get u/notjohnpodesta back in here to divulge his method.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm not gate-keeping the topic. I'm gate-keeping the fact that you and others are getting so pissy in the discussion of this topic that you're fighting each other over it.</p>
<p>I would love to see a productive thread on the topic. But this one and the other one were not.</p>
<p>Both are now unlocked. The other one will remain hidden for the time being.</p>

<p><p>U/depressedexplorer is the one that came to my thread starting arguments.  I told him several times that we appreciate his opinion but would rather follow this until its exhausted but he keeps posting here. He threatened to dox  ME ASSHOLE!!! ONLY THING I DID WAS LOOK AT HIS POST HISTORY. You must be the one up voting his comments about jailbait being just fine. You called yourself the gatekeeper. Not me. Ironic because your actions demonstrate the opposite. No subject is taboo except this subject </p></p>

<p><p>Ok go ahead. Evidently your data collection is rather weak. You missed the mark on some claims you have. How can we trust your "skills" if you cant even figure out that i am a grown, armed male. Dox me. Idc. You cant. Browse my post history all day idgaf. What are you going to prove? That i take pain meds and smoke wax to help with the horrible pain of living with ulcerative colitis? that i hate satanist pedofiles? that i enjoyed a cryptography puzzle in a video game a few years ago?....Oooh you were able to find out where im from because my username has the area. Oooh spooky...Do you see how you are proving to us that you are here, in this thread to distract us.  And btw, you outed yourself. I only stated the obvious. </p></p>
