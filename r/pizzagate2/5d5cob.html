<strong>Some thoughts and criticisms</strong>
<p><p>I think you guys are onto the scandal of the century.   Whether it will actually break into the mainstream is another question.  A few thoughts and criticisms: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The email that sparked the investigation, the "pizza-related" handkerchief map, may in fact be referring to an actual handkerchief with a map of (ostensible) pizza joints on it.   People are creating all sorts of bizarre and grotesque theories (it's a handkerchief with semen!), but just do a google image search for handkerchief plus map and you will find tons of examples.   They're actually a thing.  Kathryn Tate, a real estate agent who doesn't normally correspond with Podesta, sent him the email after they were looking at properties.    He said he didn't care about it.   Why would Ms. Tate associate pizza with Podesta?  Because John and Tony are famous for their "pizza parties."  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pizza joint(s) implicated in pizzagate are legitimate businesses in addition to being possible fronts for pedophilia and child trafficking.   It is not unreasonable to assume that Podesta really does have pizza parties, and really is a good cook, and really does love pasta and expensive cheese.   It's the non-food related "entertainment" that worries me.   The sheer number of pizza-related emails in the Podesta files, combined with the obvious pedo references of James Alefantis and his pals, combined with Tony's sickening art collection and relationship with Dennis Hastert etc etc are more than enough to justify an investigation.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since pizza (and possibly other food references) appear to be code (referring to both actual pizza and...pedophilia?) we shouldn't assume that everyone sending emails about food are "in on it."   Depending on the individual, they may just be referring to the real thing.   When it comes to the emails, far more incriminating than any of the food references is the Muzatta (sp?) stuff explicitly referencing the ages of children and describing them as "entertainment."   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another particularly telling email is the one about Dennis Hastert.   It is said that he would soon be fleeing to "a certain unnamed Japanese island."  Tony and Dennis both taught in Japan.   That email indicates to me that they knew exactly what Dennis was doing the whole time.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given the constant references to pizza, the centrality of Comet ping pong, and the pedo-logo of Besta Pizza, it is understandable that people are examining pizza joints everywhere for signs of something sinister.   I too find it a bizarre "coincidence" that Besta Pizza, located two doors down, has (or had) a "boy lover" symbol, and that another Clinton-linked business on the same block has a "girl lover" symbol.   As Mark Crispin Miller said, "I don't really consider myself a conspiracy theorist, but when you get too many coincidences I start to get a little suspicious."   I think people are right to pursue these potential links.   But I also think we need to tread carefully.   Pyramids and hearts and spirals are pretty common symbols.   Hearts-within-hearts and pyramids-within-pyramids are much less common and are more likely to be be a tell, but in some cases may be coincidental.        </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The logo of Comet Ping Pong does not a resemble a butterfly.   It's two crossed ping pong rackets, similar to the logo of various tennis orgs.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obviously not everyone who associates with the prime suspects should be considered suspects; there needs to be additional evidence beyond mere association.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It goes without saying that we should not be harassing any of these people no matter how guilty they look.   If "pizzagate" is real, and I believe at least some of it is, there may be counter-intelligence efforts underway.   Insiders may currently be harassing innocent business owners in a bid to create a "witch hunt" narrative.   Dumb or unstable individuals may be doing same, unwittingly aiding the perps.    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Online witch hunt" will probably be the narrative the media runs with assuming they ever cover the story, along with references to "conspiracy theorists," "Satanic panic," "alt-right", "Trump supporters," "religious fundamentalists," "anti-Semitic," "anti-gay" etc.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another form of counter-intelligence is to distract investigators with false leads, sew division and mire people down with bullshit.   The occult connections are real, and should not be ignored, but imo should take a backseat to the pedophilia itself.   On the subject of sewing division, I am currently seeing constant accusations on this forum of people being "shills".   Person A will argue: "Pushing Satanist stuff is going to turn people off".   Person B will argue "The occult angle is essential to the conspiracy -- you're a shill."  We should be aware that a common tactic for actual shills is to call other people shills (check out the history of COINTELPRO; one of the ways FBI agents would break up dissident groups was for informants to accuse effective leaders of being...informants.  It's called snitch jacketing).   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imo, actual shills will be the ones pushing obviously false leads that have no supporting evidence (they could also just be overzealous idiots); people pushing bigotry against specific groups (though bigotry is common); and (on the opposite end, and the posters MOST likely to be shills) people dismissing pizzagate entirely with specious arguments and snark about "tinfoil hats" and autism.    I have no problem accusing this last group of being shills.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My personal opinion about the occult angle: along with the people who actually believe in Satanism, occult ceremonies are used to traumatize the kids and make them sound nuts if they ever come forward.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Possible ways to inure average people to the occult angle should you feel so inclined: Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove and the Temple on Jeffrey Epstein's "sex slave" island.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the subject of the FBI itself, some people believe that the Feds are going to ride to the rescue.   This is an irrational belief.   Since its inception the FBI's primary function has been to protect members of the ruling class.   They have targeted labor unions, peace groups, American Indian activists, environmentalists and basically anyone who has tried to fight the status quo.   During COINTELPRO they framed activists, used agent provocateurs and even allowed bombs to be detonated.   Following 9/11 they have set up mentally ill and borderline retarted Muslim patsies in order to advance the "war on terror" narrative and justify their bloated budget.   The FBI is America's Stasi.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having said that, it is possible that Trump (assuming he isn't also implicated) will use Pizzagate to destroy his political enemies.   It is also true that there are good people in the FBI and other intelligence agencies that may leak information.   Ultimately it is up to us to keep uncovering evidence and raising public awareness. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Maddie kidnapping angle may be misdirection; on the other hand the police sketches are indeed remarkably similar to the Podesta brothers (and indeed the other sketch does strongly resemble Anthony Weiner), right down to the mole above "Tony"s eyebrow.   It beggars belief that the Podesta brothers would be sneaking around a rich neighborhood and breaking into homes; however it is possible that Maddie was being "loaned out" to the Podesta's for the evening and something went wrong.   Perhaps she started screaming and violence resulted.    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Women were also implicated in the disappearance of Maddie.   I have noticed on some forums that some people are skeptical of pizzagate due to the apparently large number of women involved.   In fact, the most recent research indicates that about one-third of pedophiles are female.   The number may be even higher since kids (and boys in particular) are less likely to report abuse by females.   Female serial killers are also much more common than most people assume.   Their targets are typically the elderly, children and babies.     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of babies, WTF is up with the Alefantis circle's obsession with babies!?  ("baby...yum"; "gay baby!" etc.).   It's hard enough to understand how people could be sexually attracted to children, let alone babies.   I'm not sure I even want to understand.   I can't seem to find the image (It was posted on the main 8chan thread yesterday, perhaps someone else can track it down) but this sick paraphilia also extends to Tony Podesta: he has a huge fucking painting of a baby in diapers with an adult touching its stomach right in his fucking living room.   Who would do that!?  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The focus on babies may perhaps give credence to the "inter-generational pedophilia" theory.   It is claimed that ruling class families use pedophilia as a means of establishing class solidarity and ensuring no one steps out of line.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On that note, pedophilia is also used for blackmail.   It has been suggested that Epstein is Mossad.   His partner in crime, Giselle Maxwell, was the daughter of the late Robert Maxwell, a Mossad agent.   I wonder if James ("I love children") Alefantis is linked to some intelligence agency.   It could explain why he has been to the White House several times.   It could also explain his name (J'aime les enfants).  Perhaps he was given a fake name, a fake identity and even fake relatives, which isn't uncommon for deep cover intelligence assets (his name could also be a coincidence, albeit a remarkable one).  People really need to look into his early history.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps the single most disturbing piece of information I've come across is that Barack Obama intends to move into a house two doors down from Tony Podesta.   Tony recently created a massive sub-basement in his home, allegedly for his "art collection."  I'm gonna take a wild guess and suggest it is soundproof.   The pic of Obama playing ping pong at the White House with the boy is starting to take on disturbing implications.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this goes all the way to the top, and I believe it does, then it would explain why law enforcement agencies haven't busted the perps.   Or why they only bust them when too many witnesses come forward, then portray them as lone assailants and give them slaps on the wrist rather than severe punishment (Hastert, Epstein etc.).   I could easily see a high ranking FBI officer justify a coverup by saying to him or herself "If this got out the entire system would collapse; there would be anarchy."   Well, if that's the justification, perhaps it's time for a little anarchy.   I can't imagine anything worse than being ruled by satanic pedophiles.   </p>

<p><p>Very nice write up. There is so many circumstantial pieces that taken as a whole look much worse than any individual evidence. </p>
<p>For me a big part of this is understanding and following up on the language / symbolism / art of this very frightening subculture. It seems clear to me that they revel in a shared and mutually supported Community that seems very well organized and funded. </p>
<p>I think this aspect freaks me out the most. It is truly organized evil. A well functioning parasitical and pathological social system.</p>
<p>In my View there are a few major angles to follow up on.</p>
<p>Art/culture: Music bands artist performers and the crowds the hang with and perform to</p>
<p>Financial: money flows institutions foundations trust funds etc. and who gets paid what</p>
<p>Nonprofit organizations: Child  / sex trafficking /abuse / orphanage....  they have to source their product somewhere</p>
<p>When I first joined this sub it was about 2500 and now it's more than triple that. When I see a bunch of rehashed and reheated old stuff floating from the conspiracy sub Reddit, it looks like a lazy shill job intent on downgrading the overall quality.</p>
<p>McCann and Portugal to me smells like building up a strawman which is easy to shoot down. </p>
<p>The same with all this Hampstead old news</p>
<p>I wish there was a stickied post that graded the level of plausibility of the various theories floating around here. I mean some of the stuff that is discussed  is reasonable and some is just pure bullshit</p>
<p>Anyway good post thank you for your thoughts</p></p>

<p>That is precisely what FBI Anon said. He said if the truth came out, it would bring down the entire federal government and there would be an uprising. Plus there would be multiple wars, since international actors are connected. </p>
<p>Aside from whether FBI Anon is legit, the fact is that the reasoning being expressed is fallacious. </p>
<p>If we are ruled by child traffickers and pedophiles, we already HAVE a case of lawless chaos and we are all endangered. </p>
<p>A little anarchy would be a welcome remedy right now. </p>
<p>The best, most logical, and most courageous thing to do would be to leak the truth to the world, uncensored. We will need to go through the pain, and grow from it. </p>
<p>There is no rational excuse to hide the information. Not a second longer.</p>
<p>If someone within the NYPD or FBI has photos of what happens to these children, the world needs to see. </p>
<p>We need the next Frederick Douglass or Dietrich Bonhoeffer right now. Someone strong enough to risk everything for the sake of truth and honor. </p></p>

<p><p>For him to even address this and to go further and counterattack means he's rattled....and don't think he's not thinking further down the road about what happens now that killary is out, the NYPD and FBI have seen the evidence and there is growing public awareness and outrage.</p>
<p>The chances of this getting swept under the rug like every other time are getting smaller and smaller...and he knows it.</p></p>

<p><p>Bear with me in my shot in the dark here but some set of hazy memories for me were set in motion after having seen "map" decoded as semen and certain images from Marina's Spirit cook book. </p>
<p>There were images there of various "squiggles" that seemed to be nothing at all but...squiggles. </p>
<p>Occult diviners that "read" things such as tea, leaves, bones, blood, entrails or...semen...would call the placement of the medium (whatever it is) on its "canvass" a "map" which was then to be read as guidance or prognostication. Maybe completely wrong but possibly the handkerchief was the canvass and the semen (or whatever) made the map. I think the odd markings in the spirit cook book may have been a guide to reading "maps" like these. </p></p>
