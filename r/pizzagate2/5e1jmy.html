<strong>I am dumping everything I have. wethepizza_the2ndGuy will dump everything else he has tonight and will cease communication for his OPSEC</strong>
<p><ul>
<li>
<p>I uploaded 10 sickening child rape images today as proof that We the Pizza is owned by child rapists, they were latter removed by Reddit (ask a mod to confirm if you doubt)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within 2 hours of posting the photos, wethepizza.com, which has suspicious locations in Washington DC, Arlington, VA and Saudi Arabia immediately took down their website</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://s22.postimg.org/r6mpsjx1t/Pricing_guide.png">/u/wethepizza_the2ndGuy will post the FULL .PDF tonight, but for security reasons here is a screenshot of "Pricing guide.pdf":</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some other redditors have found very suspicious links between this restaurant and other pedo owned restaurants </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here is the encrypted client list that is generated for November by the bizarre .exe. It attempts to send this message to 7 different email accounts, and and an IP located in London:</p>

<p>Since this is my final message, and I have 100% faith /u/wethepizza_the2ndGuy will provide genuine authentication of the data dump and probably decrypt the client list and this will lead to BIG names being ousted as child raping murderers, I want to thank everyone here for being brave and doing the right thing.

<p><p>Oh my...</p>
<p>First things first - enjoy prison.</p>
<p>Secondly - you just single handedly pissed off Reddit, 4chan, and 8chan.. Have fun with that. you should research "doxxing" to figure it out, now that thousands of people are probably targeting you with full intentions on getting you arrested for what you posted.</p>
<p>This won't even discredit this subreddit... You dug your own grave and then for some reason took a hot steaming pile of shit inside of it before laying down to be buried alive. You're the only one that's gonna have repercussions from this, you dumb fuck.</p></p>

<p><p>I found OP's first thread via /r/all this morning. I didn't click the links OP shared, but I saw it was confirmed by others. Through all this, I thought, surely this can't be a troll... it's one thing to make up a troll story, but OP provided actual disgusting photos. Why would someone actually share illegal and disgusting things for a laugh?</p>
<p>Guess I was wrong. I still don't get why. Why the hell would even the most socially inept idiot think it would be funny to do this?  I feel bad for the users who actually looked at those images to confirm they were legit, they essentially put themselves at risk and scarred themselves for nothing. OP is such a piece of shit and  I hope they get in huge trouble. </p></p>

<p><p>These photos linked Spike Mendehlson in my awareness to Andrew Kline, Alefantis, .. why troll in this direction? His instagram has real shady crap on it. The pizza site was altered today. I don't condone posting C P to reddit at all IMHO this is a real leak, but unprofessionally done. Just my humble opinion. </p></p>

<p><p>No, I don't believe what was posted here. It led to other facts which are not crap some troll posted. </p>
<p>Andrew Kline is Spike's lawyer. Do I really need to explain how that is related to Alefantis and Pingpong because he's his lawyer too. Oh and Kline works for the DOJ for human trafficking AND he owns besta pizza which has a known pedophile symbol as a logo - and you're telling me prosecution at DOJ doesn't know what pedo symbology is?</p>
<p>This leak was a LEAD. Do you understand what a lead is? It is something you use to go find real facts which are useful. That's what happened. </p></p>

<p><p>LOL @ "finish them" - wtf is this? Mortal Kombat? </p>
<p>Edit: let's assume there were pics. How would any of us have any way to confirm that they are unique and new? It's not like anyone is owning up to their CP collection and no one has any way to cross reference or verify. If "they" are real, the pictures, no one has any legal means to confirm anything about them anyway. </p>
<p>Is this a ploy to get unsuspecting people to download CP? Is this an attempt to have Reddit shut down the sub due to CP sharing? </p>
<p>I take everything you say with a very, very large degree of doubt and grain of salt. </p>
<p>Edit from my other post: </p>
<p>Yeah. Also consider: if you were a pedo, someone who wants to rape a child, why would you rape a maimed and tortured kid? </p>
<p>They've shared a PGP key but nothing related to it - dope. </p>
<p>They produced a "spreadsheet" with a kindergarten level data sheet and one which employs ultra crude terminology. You'd think people doing this shit would be a bit more sophisticated. </p>
<p>99% sure that this is a troll or complete disinfo; other shit on this sub, it's probably on point, but this? This is distraction and disinfo. </p>
<p>Everything they've done, it's easy enough to replicate in a few hours or less. </p>
<p>They're also suggesting they have an executable which dials out to the internet and emails 7 addresses, which sounds like the 7 proxies copypasta; not to mention that this executable as described would send beacons across the internet unencrypted or masked. </p>
<p>I don't believe any of this shit until I can rip the executable apart in IDA Pro or any other program. </p>
<p>I'm especially wary of their shared PDFs which are trivially weaponized and often used to pop companies in basic spearphishing campaigns. </p></p>

<p><p>Yes, a mod has already verified this.  And you people are truly pathetic.  You spend more time 'discussing' if something is fake or not, than you have spent <em>in your life</em> actually putting your asses on the line and investigating it like these two fools did...shame on the lot of you.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah, it was to tinyupload or some site like that. Most accounts that are longer users said it was blank/deleted. My guess is OP uploaded something bogus, quickly erased it and had other shills reply saying "ITS ACTUAL CP OP IS FOREAL". We need to proceed with caution, regardless. OP is either a troll, or some kinda intelligence personnel/paid shill trying to entrap people looking into all of this. </p></p>

<p><p>One of the Mods confirmed it himself. Apparently there really was CP in the linked file, however no confirmation if it is what we're accusing them of having. They say it could be random filth from deep web used for trolling.</p></p>

<p><p>Distraction from Alefantis and Andrew Kline and Obama? How is that a distraction? This is a real lead even if nothing comes out of the leak itself. Shout at me all you want, the facts of Alefantis &amp; Mendelsohn having Kline of DOJ AND Besta pizza as a lawyer are real. That is not a distraction. That is a lead. </p></p>

<p><p>I'm not waiting. Have you looked at Spike's instagram? It's got some really iffy pictures, some of which were commented on by an account by "TheBrightestYoungThings" - &amp; their Facebook page looks like it should be illegal. Look up "the brightest young things" on Facebook and tell me this isn't a lead. </p>
<p>TBYT website also has a pass protected login area...</p>
<p>Again.. without these posters I would never have seen that connection.</p></p>

<p><p>Hmm ok going into the mind of the pedophile here, why exactly would it be less expensive to kill a baby than a 14 year old? You would think babies are more rare and possibly in higher demand than older children. </p></p>

<p><p>Yeah exactly, also..lets say this was all true. Wouldn't it make sense to kill off the older children for less money, because they only have a few years to go as a kid anyway? The baby you could still exploit for years before it's becoming too old. </p></p>

<p><p>Yeah. Also consider: if you were a pedo, someone who wants to rape a child, why would you rape a maimed and tortured kid? </p>
<p>They've shared a PGP key but nothing related to it - dope. </p>
<p>They produced a "spreadsheet" with a kindergarten level data sheet and one which employs ultra crude terminology. You'd think people doing this shit would be a bit more sophisticated. </p>
<p>99% sure that this is a troll or complete disinfo; other shit on this sub, it's probably on point, but this? This is distraction and disinfo. </p>
<p>Everything they've done, it's easy enough to replicate in a few hours or less. </p>
<p>They're also suggesting they have an executable which dials out to the internet and emails 7 addresses, which sounds like the 7 proxies copypasta; not to mention that this executable as described would send beacons across the internet unencrypted or masked. </p>
<p>I don't believe any of this shit until I can rip the executable apart in IDA Pro or any other program. </p>
<p>I'm especially wary of their shared PDFs which are trivially weaponized and often used to pop companies in basic spearphishing campaigns. </p></p>

<p><p>You clearly do not understand anything about how this operates. Go learn something about human trafficking from 3rd world countries then speak up again. Why do you suppose Monica Petersen just died in Haiti? </p>
<p>Thousands of kids are missing the immigration fuckup in Europe/middle east. Main stream media even covers that. </p>
<p>So go look up some facts about how child trafficking works. Fuck. </p></p>

<p><p>Perhaps, but you would think that babies have a lot more years to make money for the brothel owner, whereas 14 year olds are on their way out of the child sex industry due to becoming too old very soon. It would make sense to let them get killed off for less money. </p></p>

<p><p>Not to be a sticker, but was the distinction between minor and major torture really necessary?</p>
<p>Then there's the "finish them"
I don't know much about the average kiddy-fiddler but I'm going to hazard a guess and say they're not big mortal kombat fans, but strangely enough trolls are.</p>
<p>Now; are we to believe that paedophiles are subjectively assessing whether they can afford to torture minors majorly, or marginally minorly.</p>
<p>However, this leads to more questions; what if there is a dispute over the severity of the enacted torture?
Does the perpetrator of the torture get a 20% off coupon, or perhaps a free pizza party and an array of delicate cheeses sent  in a box to their home as a way of ensuring customer satisfaction?</p>
<p>I think we can all agree that this has been a wild goose chase, perpetrated with assistance from the administration of wethepizza.com</p>

<p><p>Well.. I'm calling bullshit on both your stories until I see it on the news or actual proof is provided. Please people, spend your time better than chasing this tail. Go out and dig elsewhere.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah I put that badly. I meant that I won't believe it until there is some form of reporting being done on this story, with evidence provided by the alleged hack of WeThePizza, that I don't think has occured.</p></p>

<p><p>just for everyone to see: 
http://www.realtruenews.org/single-post/2016/09/27/Inside-Correct-the-Record-Post-Debate-PLOT
It is from september 27. and mentions to plant something at we the pizza.
There are 3 possibilities:
I op is CTR;
II some master class troll has posted both info, since it is unlikely that ctr is expose in a private channel with just 5 members;
III Op is telling the truth with Ctr knowing it and posting something about we the pizza in advance </p></p>

<p><p>I honestly don't know what your game is OP. If this is a honeypot, I don't understand why you're still updating. You set your trap and got some bites. Mission accomplished. What does the low quality pricing guide and PGP nonsense do?</p>
<p>If this is a troll, why would you blow your load in the first thread? Where can you possibly go after that?</p>
<p>Best guess I can make at this point is that you're trying to take down the sub for distributing illegal material. Could be a legitimate attempt to stop discussion about an alleged child sex ring. Could be a butthurt lib mad people are denigrating Queen Hillary. Or it could be an edgy shit disturber out to spread chaos.</p></p>
