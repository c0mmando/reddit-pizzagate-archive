<strong>This isn't about Right vs. Left or Trump vs. Clinton, it's about the children. Language is making outsiders dismiss everything.</strong>
<p><p>I know that many came here from The_Donald, but this has turned into something that's far much bigger than the election. When outsiders come here and see constant political attacks leaning one side, all of the legitimate material that has emerged is often dismissed. </p>
<p>The recent piece from Washington City Paper's accusation of an alt-right conspiracy is a good example of how political bias is neutering this investigation. There are plenty of moral Bernie supporters/Democrats that would be horrifying to see this stuff if they dug deeper, unfortunately many of them are turned off before it gets to that point.</p>
<p>Another suggestion is to avoid the satanic talk too, it makes your argument sound ridiculous and has no benefit. I cannot express more how important it is to be taken seriously for this to go further, don't let them win and continue to hide before a public investigation happens!</p></p>

<p><p>Bernie supporter here. I'm no Trump fan, but I think this story is incredibly important, and it's definitely not just Trump people paying attention. This is not about politics, it's about exploring a story that <em>needs</em> to be explored, no matter how unbelievably disturbing it is. </p></p>

<p><p>I voted for Hillary Clinton and I am following this very closely. I know some may think I'm crazy for doing so, but I had my reasons. Not sure if I would do the same today, but I'm glad this sub is devoted to finding truth, regardless of who it implicates. Though I am democrat and supported HRC, if she is implicated in this, I hope justice will be served.</p></p>

<p><p>I agree with everything you say except for trying to ignore the satanic aspect of it. These rings are usually associated with some type of cult or satanic practices, and this fact can't be swept under the rug given the spirit cooking connections and other red flags</p></p>

<p><p>Any proof of that? AFAIK most of these rings get connected to satanic cults by tabloid magazines. I am not aware of a single case where this turned out to be true. (Apart from some smaller stories)</p></p>

<p><p>Just a reminder that it doesn't matter for the purposes of this story, really, if Satan is real:</p>
<p>1) perhaps <em>they</em> believe that Satan is real, and that they derive power from defiling the innocent: if that was the case, it would be hard to distinguish their behavior from a scenario where some dark presence was acting in their midst. See for example https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolfo_Constanzo  there is no need to insist that anything supernatural is happening 
2) they could believe in some other entity or manifestation rather than the horn-hoofed deity most have in mind, e.g. luciferianism vs satanism 
3) they could believe in the "symbolic, psychological power" of personal realization by embracing the dark imagery, basically a loose darker version of The Secret 
4) it could be completely symbolic, the "sacrifice of care/virtue/innocence", e.g. look at some interpretations of the Bohemian Grove 
5) it could be some bizarre snuff-film style deviance where they get off sexually or power trip on the fear their victims experience by being subjected to these images</p>
<p>All that said, I suspect you are right that some people will be turned off by the satanism stuff and dismiss the entire thing out of hand. But I guess I wonder how many people you lose by telling the more complete story when the two prevailing narratives are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the most powerful and well-known people on the planet (including John Posesta, Hillary Clinton, perhaps Barack Obama) participate in, or provide shelter to, a massive ring of child-trafficking pedophiles obsessed with art depicting violence</p>
</li>

<p>I have no idea if any of this stuff is true. The Comet Ping pong stuff is incredibly suspect.</p></p>

<p><p>Molech in the Old King James Bible, is the god of the UNWILLING or UNWITTING sacrifice of children. They either had to steal the children or trick the parents into giving them the child for the child sacrifice to be the "best". Here is a quote. Many more in biblegateway                 "Jeremiah 32:35 And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</p></p>

<p><p>Not sure, but I know he goes by many names. Most begin with the letter B.  Im a biologist and a law grad so, my mind is naturally bent toward evidence gathered in science, and... it better be good enough to put on the judges bench? So wouldn't want to confirm unless I researched. However, for us science/legal computer expert types, a dive into the old scrolls (66 in the bible and 800+ in the dead sea scrolls library) is a real trip. If I was presenting in a court case trying to figure out where these strange satanic beliefs come from, I would direct people to what has to be the greatest scientific study on the ancient historical texts to date. It's on you tube. Look up Chuck Missler "Learn the Bible in 24 hours"  Missler worked for the NSA under the guy who broke the Japanese Code in WWII. This study of that "Ancient Hebrew Text" is a jaw dropper, and takes little time. And now that I actually know what is in that book, it was no surprise to me to see "spirit cooking" and the MONSTER TURNOUT by the Christian population, for Trump. I almost expected it. </p></p>

<p><p>The original King James.... for the craziest most surprising reason to me... You know all those "Thee and thou" things that make it hard to read? Turns out King James was bothered horribly by the fact that the original languages (Hebrew and Greek) both had a plural "you" (like our southern drawl y'all) and they had a singular "you" as in "you alone". He wanted the best translation. So he instructed the translators to use the legalese royal language "thee and thy" for singular, and all the "you yours" stuff is when they are speaking to crowds. This makes it way less confusing once you decode it. Also, the scientists use this old version for 2 other reasons. 1) The historians/archaeologists say that where the few mistakes are, they are well known from years of study. 2) There were no copyright laws King James had to deal with, so he was allowed to do as close to word for word as he could. Almost all translations today have to paraphrase, so they avoid infringement on another version? Sticking to Original King James when looking at the original texts has a lot of scholarly support in research like this. And Missler, being an NSA coding expert, does a good job of taking people through the original text languages. It's important to him, as a computer scientist.  Have fun watching that "Learn the Bible in 24 Hours" series... it will blow your mind if you have any science/history, or computer expertise. Way fun.</p></p>

<p><p>My mind was blown away in the first ten minutes. I'll be watching the entire series probably ten to fifteen times. I'm going to order a King James Bible now. Thank you so much for providing me with all this material and knowledge, it's a gift that will change my life. </p></p>

<p><p>Thank you. We need to have  serious discussions, not what equates to finger pointing and name calling. There's A LOT of that going through here right now (from suspiciously new accounts...) and it's just making us look bad, or worse, unreliable. The last thing we need is to get drowned out in the sea of people screaming for blood OR the increasing amount of misinformation and distractions that are continually being fed to us.</p></p>

<p><p>Cognitive Dissonance is making people dismiss this.  Also sexual abuse is very difficult to prove.  Even more so when parents and kidnapped children are involved.  I hope Trump really is the outsider he says he is, and is able to use the expanded power of the security state, Rico laws, and civil asset forfeiture against these people.  </p></p>

<p><p>Well 1st off Drumpf cant put anyone in congress the people vote for congressmen based off where you live.  2nd The Bushes all voted for Hillary there is 0 love there.  I didnt vote for Drumpf in the primary I wanted Rand.  I did support Donald in the general because I agree with his foreign policy and he recognizes the need to fix healthcare.  Also i didnt want Hillary stacking the court with more SJWs.  He is uncouth but I dont think he is racist.  Although he did tap into peoples anger at political correctness which tows a close line to racism.  That being said you are the gullible one buying into MSM bullshit.</p></p>

<p><p>You are right about the facts, Trump appears to be one of them. As you said, just look at his cabinet. Hegelian Dialectic playing out again. People can't hear you better if you call them names. You'd get more mileage if you'd drop the insults. </p></p>

<p><p>For what it's worth, I'm liberal leaning and I was not turned off by the political rhetoric, I know that comes with the territory of being a large group of motivated individuals. I was turned off by a total lack of any convincing or credible evidence of anything other than questionable taste in art. It's a bunch of imagined or spurious connections dreamed up by people determined to find something that isn't there, aided by tons and tons of confirmation bias.</p></p>

<p><p>No, been studying this over 20 years. Way bigger than either party. Just happens that one of the major foundations involved when this broke is clinton foundation. Guarantee you this is going to break big outside the US, across both partys, and end up somewhere in some MONSTER Nuremberg like international Trial or Tribunal.</p></p>

<p><p>That's quite a guarantee. If the evidence you have is what's available in this place, then this will never go anywhere because there is absolutely nothing to have a trial on. There isn't one shred of actual evidence. </p></p>

<p><p>There is massive evidence, but, if I were you, I would not follow it at the moment. The heavy researchers are in photo gathering stage, and you don't want to risk getting those on your computer? I followed them to the first photo with the knife at the child's throat. Then I realized they need to start protecting themselves. It use to be all Trump supporters doing the research, but, now we have Democrats, greens, good grief...people who don't vote are tearing into this. This is America. We need to go foreword together. There are millions of children to save. And if you don't believe it, that is ok. Bad enough you will get wind when it has to break out in the news later. But, I'm telling you... it is bad. Bad enough for me to quit researching for the time being, get em all a diary to create a chain of evidence to protect themselves.</p></p>

<p><p>I believe there are fucked up people in the world, and plenty of photos i don't want to see, and probably even a high profile individual or two who have done things that would outrage the public, and even more who have opted to look the other way to keep things quiet.</p>
<p>I don't believe there is a secret cabal of elite pedophiles, who may or may not engage in ritualistic sacrifice and cannibalism, and then flaunt it through their pizza parlors logo and speak in codes.</p>
<p>One of those things is not like the other. It's pretty convenient that you can't share any of the "evidence"</p></p>

<p><p>The evidence is at /r/pizzagate. But please, be careful as you get deeper into that stuff.... please. Thing is, the BEST people here start out saying EXACTLY what you are saying, and we have learned that this is ok.... because... what is over there... NO ONE who is normal should start out believing it. So, with all the respect for you that I can muster, I can tell you to head over there... and just give you the best warning I can to be really really careful when you start looking at the actual web sites, ok? And if it gets too crazy, remember, you have to have the stomach for this kind of thing, so it's ok to quit. There are other things to investigate here.</p></p>

<p><p>I also agree with what you say. This is non partisan issue. HOWEVER the satanic/pedophile nature of the art should not be ignored. Because there is NO telling what the people doing this believe about Satan or Moloch (The Owl-Ancient Biblical god requiring the sacrifice of children) or BAAL (Ancient biblical god requiring human sacrifice especially children) and the whole truth needs to be investigated.  Deeper in the evidence, it looks like Higher ups (Both sides of isle)  and maybe even a supreme court justice implicated. It's even looking international. So, whether you find the evidence on the left or right, in the middle or outside the border, all of it matters, and all of us care. It just happens that the Clinton Foundation is biggest "visible"suspect child mover at the moment. Keep your eyes out for other Non profits or foundations involved. There may be more we will find eventually.</p></p>
