<strong>Can we rule out the Pizza Code words?</strong>
<p><p>First time poster, been following this since the beginning and i think it's time to drop the code word angle. </p>
<p>People are still using the key to skim through new emails and i don't understand why considering the key was pieced together based on speculation on emails we had no context for. Seems like some of us are clinging to a narrative at this point when we should be equally interested in disproving it. The code is garbage, the emails make sense in their context and though it was worth looking into, it's lead to some witch hunting that doesn't seem that justified now (which is not cool and we may need to start dishing out some apologies). </p>
<p>I'd like to see people re focused on the Lolita Express because that is the most damning lead i have heard about on this board. </p>
<p>Also i don't think Podesta is a satanist, i think he's just an eccentric with a voyeuristic interest of the occult (which isn't that unusual) and also genuinely likes to cook.</p></p>

<p><p>no, we can't. a lot of the statements with the code words make zero sense unless the words are in fact code. further, it's long been speculated that almost none of these people are actually satanists, this is just a form of pay to play. as in: if someone wants the position, they will play along with these people and allow themselves to be recorded doing these insane acts, so that they can be forever blackmailed.</p>
<p>TLDR: no</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah but how many of these emails need to be debunked before you stop clinging to the code word key. For instance the stuff about "Christmas pasta" and "walnut sauce". There is video online of Podesta showing how to make walnut sauce. How many of these emails need to get debunked before the key falls apart because that was one of the big ones, and if the key is disproved, what sense to keep combing emails with the same key words? </p>
<p>Also, why is the spirit cooking considered blackmail worthy if Lady Gaga and this "artist" are doing it out in public? Is there evidence that points to this being a black mail scheme and not just exhibitionism? </p></p>

<p><p>Explain to me the sleeping partner email with the attached picture of Mr Potato head.  Then we can have a serious talk about debunking the emails.</p>
<p>If it were one or two emails that were odd we could write it off as just strange wording, but to ignore so many emails with so many strange turns of phrase is to bury your head in the sand.</p></p>

<p><p>when you are reading these emails a lot of this personal shit will come off as discombobulated, relating to conversations you never heard. A lot of these people are parents and grandparents who may have their own sense of humour. As a parent i crack jokes about a lot of my kids toys/tv shows. Sometimes waking up to find my bed lined with stuffed animals. I just need more at this point. I'll give you the beanie baby thing still seems weird to me. </p></p>

<p><p>if i was talking to you about a bank robbery, and calling it a ballet recital, i might upload videos of myself doing ballet, to continue the sham.</p>
<p>further, of course the spirit cooking as publicly shown is nothing. abramovic herself said "when done publicly, it is art; when done privately, it is ritual."</p>
<p>in other words; when done publicly, they use fake props, but when done privately, it is done real and correctly.</p>
<p>try to read between the lines. </p></p>

<p><p>I would assume all that changes is the intent when it comes to the spirit cooking, she may very well be versed in delivering some sort of ritual sermon. I see her as kind of a charlatan and she could simply be telling these people "Please participate because we are doing this for real" and that could be the extent of it. A lot of Celebs have dabbled in the occult and surely their is a market to serve that. I can't make the leap to think that suddenly it involves some kind of human sacrifice or criminal behavior just based on hot dog stand in hawaii, especially how casual they are talking about it. If everything is code why not disguise a evening where potentially criminal activity is going down? </p></p>

<p><p>absolutely not. even Crowley wrote something similar to what she said - saying that for the ritual to be truly performed, it has to be real. there are "levels" of acceptable blood, starting with virgin innocents (crowley wrote that the younger, the better, as the demons prefer cleaner blood), progressing to priests, the blood of your enemies, and the least desirable which is the blood of an animal</p>
<p>for her to perform the ritual... as a ritual... requires a true sacrifice, not a facsimile. </p></p>

<p>For perfume mix meal &amp; honey &amp; thick leavings of red wine: then oil of Abramelin and olive oil, and afterward soften &amp; smooth down with rich fresh blood.
The best blood is of the moon, monthly: then the fresh blood of a child, or dropping from the host of heaven: then of enemies; then of the priest or of the worshippers: last of some beast, no matter what.
This burn: of this make cakes &amp; eat unto me. This hath also another use; let it be laid before me, and kept thick with perfumes of your orison: it shall become full of beetles as it were and creeping things sacred unto me.</p>

<p><p>You're coming to the party late.  We've had this discussion already, a dozen times, and come back every single time that there's just too much circumstance and coincidence.  You come in here and suggest the most obvious answer that there is no code but we've already been there, this is week 3 of the investigation.  It would not have grown to this height and scale if it could have been debunked from day 1.</p></p>

<p><p>It would if you want it to, confirmation bias. There is plenty of material keeping this stuff afloat, there is stuff about symbols on signs and connections of who owns what. But what i seen as an observer since you guys started, is that the foundation of this lead is sort of crumbling as the emails start being shown to be actually about food. In which case a lot of the dot crossing about pizza places and their connections with politicians is just kinda foolish as through the emails, there is no secret there, they talk about these places and food openly. </p></p>

<p><p>I see evidence all over the board considering most the leads don't actually go anywhere and if you read the comments on articles a lot of people have pointed out the proper context of some of our original offending emails. Far be it from me to try and tamper with anyone's 15 minutes of fame but if i was about to present something to the world i'd make sure i had some actual facts besides reaffirming connections between camp hillary and some pizza place. There are a lot of people in comments who see some of the emails for what they are "walnut sauce", john's publicized love of cooking and throwing parties, a levy of emails indicating catered events and meetings with actual pizza. etc,etc. </p>
<p>The idea that this news is spreading is neato on the surface until ppl actually dig into all the false leads on this board and in the original emails. You can keep presenting this story at face value and get people interested but then u just larping, and more importantly, this all takes away from what could potentially be an actual story w/lolita express. </p></p>

<p><p>No one is larping over something is that is so grotesque that the average person can't wrap their brains around.
And 15 minutes of fame ? Most people looking into it appear to be keeping as anon as possible. 
You are educated and trying to appear polite and reasonable. 
But you're just a paid troll.  </p></p>

<p><p>dude, no one is taking the "key" for granted, its mostly based on the FBI list of pedo symbols and the urban dictionary. one of podestas mails is referred to a pool party, with the water getting heated by three young kids, 11, 9 &amp; 7 (yes, the ages are un the mail)</p></p>

<p><p>I understand this, i just don't the key has been very effective or appropriate at this point. We could assume there are plenty of fillers for codewords that could have been used but it's obvious someone read the emails and filled in the blanks using what reference they could find to craft a narrative. Words like "walnut" have been shown to be literal walnut sauce one should probably question other parts of the key or throw the lead out altogether considering stuff like this http://www.rodale.tv/video/john-podesta-can-cook</p>
<p>It seems like he genuinely just likes food and cooking and if the key does not fit you must acquit. </p>
<p>As for the pool, these seem like family environments and sometimes people just like talking about their children. </p></p>

<p><p>I'm not hating, but it's probably easier to play the game dominoes on a pizza as it's less tiring after you eat it compared to pasta, that's factual. I still think there's too much going on here, but you can debunk these emails if you want. It's just about perception. The weird thing is how many TIMES they are talking about it.</p></p>

<p><p>Yes but everyone was oh so sure this key aligned with various other emails that have been debunked, so how is this key still legitimate, is it not safe to assume this could easily be a case of old hippie politicians with eccentric manors of speech of finishing conversations we may not even be privy to? Sure dominoes could be code word for S&amp;M, but DOMINOS actually does have better pizza than pasta. Where is the levy of evidence now that makes you think otherwise? </p>
<p>Cause right now it seems to me these people just make a big deal out of food and arranging dinners, whether it be personal or "professional". </p></p>

<p><p>You can't PLAY dominos (tm) ON pizza or pasta.</p>
<p>You would say "should I get pizza or pasta from dominos?".</p>
<p>Also, I think dominos means torture.</p>
<p>In one email he references that he is still I'm the " torture chamber ".</p></p>

<p><p>no what i meant is a list with <strong>EVERY</strong> sentence of the podesta leaks wich include those words, wich we suspect to be codewords. iam thinking about creating one if something similar doesnt allready exist. then we could check wich sentences just make sense when they would use codewords (because some of the emails seem to be realy about food, and some of them not). after we picked those we could change the words to the meaning we think that they mean and look if its right or not, in general.</p></p>

<p><p>What evidence? Cause we are down to a comment about dominoes and a hot dog stand the rest of the key has fallen apart. The key itself is not evidence of anything you need to find it in the emails and the key becomes less useful when the emails it's been designed to explain have more context revealed see "walnut sauce"</p></p>

<p><p>The email about the black and white handkerchief with a pizza related map on it does not makes sense without the code. Who draws maps to pizza places on handkerchiefs? These people don’t have phones? Or paper? Handkerchiefs are mementos from these sick encounters and it sounds like one was left behind accidentally. </p></p>

<p><p>i believe the word map is code for evidence but that the pizza related is just that and i think it was said in jest. This is the problem with taking some of these comments super literally, It says, he was there and left his hankerchief with a pizza stain that could come from anywhere. It doesn't automatically mean he's in a empty peice of realestate eating pizza or commiting pedo crimes. </p></p>

<p><p>No mention of a pizza 'stain'. In the clean up of the house, they find a handkerchief with a 'pizza related map'. Why wouldn't she say 'a map to a pizza place' and how would she even know it was related to 'pizza'? Why would she use the code map=evidence, if it was just pizza? The turn of phrase is odd, 'pizza-related'? Map is likely semen as its a map that leads back to you. Handkerchiefs are placed under a victim and taken as a memento, as seen in some of the artwork of a contributor to Comet.</p></p>

<p><p>I recommend looking to the researcher David Shurter. He has done groundwork starting in 1983. He tied child abuse to govern. then. 
http://davidshurter.com/?page_id=1134</p>
<p>The pizza term originates in pedo with:</p>
<p>Willie Thiesen / Godfather’s Pizza:  A single pizza restaurant which became a national chain (which after changing hands a few times was run by former Federal Reserve Officer and winner of the Horatio Alger (a pedophile who wrote books for young boys) Award, Mr. “9 9 9” Herman Cain) under the guidance of Omaha millionaire Willie Thiesen.  It has been alleged that the Godfather’s in Omaha’s Old Market area was a location associated with occult activity and extreme child abuse.</p></p>

<p><p>Although I agree with aspects of both sides of his argument, I'm with OP on the idea of sticking with valid, proven source material (such as Lolita Express logs, Clinton Foundation donations, PAC relationships, and CGI relationships) and working outward from there. </p>
<p>Jumping on the back of a small business pizza shop because it sells pizza or has a spiral in the logo is a dangerous precedent. (And I am NOT talking about Comet or Besta--I think Besta and the relationship between Alefantis, Brock, and Capitol Hill are keys to getting the real truth of what's going on.) I refuse to believe the majority of people or businesses are bad, but I do believe the materials Wikileaks provided do have great value in uncovering unethical and/or illegal and/or human rights issues. These can exist without there being a group of Satanists involved. </p>
<p>Follow the money... donors, trips, foundations, consultants in Haiti, etc. </p></p>
