<strong>Help me understand the Satanic angle?</strong>
<p><p>OK trying to think of how to phrase this.  One of the biggest hurdles in this topic and convincing people is the Satanic angle.  I find myself included in this.  Even though I am fully aware of the spirit cooking, and tons of other shady things beyond the suspected child abuse, it still feels so outrageous to me.</p>
<p>For instance, everyone in major power is a satanist.  OK, so what happens to people who come in to power?  Let's say a self made fortune, and the power that comes along with it.  A Bill Gates, A Steve Jobs, a Zuckerberg, what is the thinking there?  They keep them unaware?  They control them?</p>
<p>At what point are we theorizing they "become" satanists?  Is it like traditional religions where we are raised that way through childhood?  I have trouble picturing a kid not letting that slip out in a suspicious way (like more cases of "daddy kills babies" videos).  If they wait until puberty or adulthood, I have trouble picturing someone just going along with it, like it is the new normal.  At this point in my life, I'd be done for some criminal activity for lots of money, let's say pull a robbery, or maim an enemy, but not sure there is anything that could get me to say "Oh yeah rape some kids?  Sounds fun.  Now hook me up with that director's position plz".  </p>
<p>Not trying to derail any discussion, or say it isn't possible.  Again, I feel like I am looking at it and seeing it (especially with the spirit cooking) but I just cant seem to have it make sense in my mind.   </p></p>

<p>Part of your problem is believing these people are self made and not carefully selected early in life</p></p>

<p><p>They are Luciferians not Satanists.  </p>
<p>It is your standard brainwashing.  It is spoon fed to you.  I believe it starts with Freemasonry.  They gauge your psychological make up there and decide if you can be trusted to learn more.  Freemasonry is their "nursery".  </p>
<p>For kids, they have groups like International Order of the Rainbow for Girls and Order of DeMolay for boys.  A lot of frats are Masonic in nature.  The rituals for Sigma Kappa were leaked throug Wikileaks, and they are Masonic. </p>
<p>The people involved in the crimes you mention are already predisposed to commit such crimes.  They do not need to be convinced.  They just have to be reassured that they will be protected by the group.  </p>
<p>As for people that are self-made, I am not sure how that would work.  I think they see how open they are to Freemasonry, then go from there.  If the person is not susceptible to being brainwashed, then they are probably kept at a lower level.  </p></p>

<p><p>They use torture methods to break and fragment the people's personalities so they can control them. They use blackmail. They tempt people with promises of wealth and power and then pull the old bait and switch (only if you do everything I tell you) card. Just read a few of the victims' accounts that have managed to leak out over the last 50 years...In fact, I dare you to just go through 3 victims accounts. That's it. Just find 3 survivors that tell a story about "ritualistic satanic child abuse" and it's undeniable that there are IN FACT weirdos in this world that rape and dismember live babies and consume them afterwards. </p>
<p>I can tell that you maybe haven't been a victim of recurring abuse as a child, because the whole "Why doesn't the kid say something" thing is a complete misunderstanding of this situation. Have you ever gone out-of-body, or disassociated because of a traumatic event? It doesn't just "go away." These kids are broken and programmed on purpose, and they do it to children because it is more effective on undeveloped minds.  The cult is more about removing power from others and feeding off of their fear. To keep your slave obedient you must know how to handle it, break it and train it. Simple as that. They think they are above other human beings and that they achieve even more power and greatness the more they destroy others. </p></p>

<p><p>Take a look at vigilantcitizen.com, there is a ton of information on there and gives you a good base knowledge to work with.</p>
<p>Content mainly revolves around the occult in the entertainment industry but I believe this is relevant to everything we are discovering in the sub.</p></p>

<p><p>I've seen people suggest that the Satanism aspect is to introduce doubt into their victims testimonies.  It seems like paedophillia would be much more common than Satanism. </p>
<p>The way I understand the power thing is, that whoever is behind it all (assuming someone is), they look for people who are rising politicians or that are wealthy, and try to get them involved in CP, once they are implicated, they are susceptible to blackmail if they don't do your bidding. You can then help them rise to power using your network of influence, and because they know you have dirt on them that would destroy them, they will do whatever you tell them to do. </p>
<p>Is this plausible? Yes. 
Is this what actually happens? Who knows, but it would be an amazing story if it could be proved. </p>
<p>Edit: you mentioned gates, jobs and zuckerberg - you can see how these people became successful without any help from a shady cabal. </p></p>

<p><p>Well you have to keep in mind that this is a civil investigation and because of this we have a lot of people from different backgrounds looking into it with different assumptions, the only thing we seem to agree on is that underage individuals are being abused and that there are "connections".</p>
<p>The satanist aspect could be many things, such as a cover to make the whole situation seem ridiculous so no one believes researchers, a theme that accompanies pervasive behavior promoted by abnormal psychological conditions, a system put in place in order to indoctrinate willing politicians into a group, or they might actually be believers.</p>
<p>The only thing that we have that points at the use of satanist, or "dark" themes is the fact that these individuals who appear to be connected to each other have a weird fascination with themes of rape, gang rape, pedophilia, occult, satanism etc. and this can be observed if you look at their art work and online activities. </p>
<p>This is something that we should be keeping in mind while considering the themes that these people are attracted to and what to possibly expect from them, but it should not be used to write science fiction in order to convince people that there is an invisible war that is going on between the forces of good and evil. For now simply keep in mind that we believe that underage individuals are being abused by a group of people and that these themes appear to surround their social activities and interests.</p></p>

<p><p>the part that really sticks to me is the spirit cooking in this case, but the most obvious example i would think is bohemian grove and their whole moloch statue/worship</p></p>

<p><p>Yes the spirit cooking by Marina Abramovic is certainly a very strong indicator of interests in dark themes, specifically because there are emails showing exchanges between her and one of the Podesta brothers. If you have seen the private art collection of Tony Podesta I'm sure you'd see why he's so interested in her work. (If you haven't seen them, go check them out as well as the artwork on the walls of Comet Pizza and Ping Pong.)</p></p>

<p><p>Thinking that everyone is a satanist is insane. That viewpoint mostly comes from the less psychologically healthy part of the internet.</p>
<p>The only argument for the satanist stuff is the theory that these people offer sadists the opportunity to engange in their perversion. </p>
<p>The satanic angle here is in that it is the opposite of the innocence the children represent. It elevates their kick. The whole thing is more an aesthetic really, these people are all empty headed atheists. Sociopaths driven only by animalistic desire devoid of an intuitive understanding of morality. Not what we generally would or should call human. They mostly see themselves as seperate from the species.</p>
<p>Having said that, the imagery appears real. You go into that rabbit hole of instagram and facebook accounts you will encounter this aesthetic.
see 'dr. pong' website background;  <a href="http://www.drpong.net/bilder.php">1 'pictures' ;</a> <a href="http://www.drpong.net/angebote.php">2'offers' ;</a> <a href="http://www.drpong.net/manifest.php">3 'manifesto'.</a></p>
<p>(there seems to be another pong restaurant related to this btw, in <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/good-living/bar-reviews/dr-pong/2010/02/15/1266082234815.html">Sydney</a>. I've never seen anybody looking at that, appears to be rather posh while that thing in Berlin is just a hole in the ground with a ping pong table.</p></p>

<p>There are so many articles... Even by reputable sources, and from years ago, that tie Clinton to Satan. It's crazy</p>

<p><p>as an atheist, anarchist, and someone completely immune to ritual, this is the most difficult element for me too. </p>
<p>when i discussed this with my mother, who is of like disposition, except that she can't bridge the gap and admit she's an anarchist as well, this is the part that made her dismiss eveyrthing, even though like me she was open to it before this element was added.</p>
<p>plus, one other thing that makes Xers like me and boomers sketchy about this is the stantic child abuse hysteria in the 80s, that were proven to be largely the result coaching by psychologists. </p>
<p>but this what i said to my mom last night:</p>
<p>we know as an historical fact that elites, even during the middle ages when they'd burn for it, have been attracted the occult. the victorians and edwardians didn't even hide the fact, which is why houdini went around debunking it. </p>
<p>we know nancy regan ran ronnie's schedule based solely on the advice of her astrologer.</p>
<p>we know that socioapathy is the rule not the exception with politicians, wall streeters, and surgeons. </p>
<p>we know sociopaths are methodological and ritualustic in their "hobbies" and derive pleasure from hurting helpless things like puppies and kittens.</p>
<p>we know that our politicians feel no remorse or responsibility for the global suffering they cause, best exemplified by madeline albright's assertion that the death of 500,000 iraqi children was worth it, hillary clinton's deranged laughter about gadaffi dying from having been raped annally with a bayonette, and obama's compete dismissal of the innocent standers by his hard for drone strikes causes.</p>
<p>we know that the catholic church is a pedophilic organization up to the highest levels. we know that its victims have been disbelieved and ostracized, even by their own parents, for decades (probably longer). </p>
<p>we know that powerful elites in mulriple govts not only knew of the church child rapist ring, they protected it.</p>
<p>we know that when sinead o'conner exposed her abuse by the catholic church when she ripped up a picture of the pope on SNL, her career was ruined, aided and abetta by people like bill marher. seriously, he unloaded on her. the only person who stood up for her was bob dylan.</p>
<p>we know bill cosby's rapes were not only known throughout hollywood, the upper echelon of hollywood actively assisted him with 
themt, just the elites in england did with seville (or whatever his name is). we know bill  marher has known about the rapes since the early 80s, by his own admission, and also that he never called the cops, by his own admission.</p>
<p>we know that two sitting justics and one former justice (thomas and alito and antonin scallia), are part of the opus die cult...which even thecxatholic church denounces as heresy.</p>
<p>we know that hollywood has been brainwashing actors with sciencetology for decades.</p>
<p>we know stars like madonna and ashton kutcher are big time kabala practioners.</p>
<p>we know drew barrymore at 8 years old was taken to adult parties and as consequence got addicted to coke and became an 8 year old alcholic.</p>
<p>we know that a large percentage of actors, muscians, artists, and synchophants have severe inferiorty conmplexes, needs to be liked, and susceptibilty to svengalies...even easy e. we know that even as full grown adults these people always seem to willingly forfeit their self agency and pre-brainwashing beliefs and convictions.</p>
<p>people don't have to believe in the devil to get hard ons for  "spooky, edgy" secretive bullshit rituals. look at that picture of lady gaga with that shoeless waif at the spirit cooking show. she's kneeling down in a get-up that you know cost several grand, talking to a skinny, hollow eyed, lankey haired, shoeless, little girl dressed in thrift shop, shabby clothes, like it's not even weird. </p>
<p>wtf was that kid doing there, esp dressed like that. rich adults dress their kids just like they dress themselves.</p>
<p>lady gaga, the patron saint of the abused.</p>
<p>i don't think we need to focus on what they believe, just that for whatever reason, what they do and how they do it is fucked up.</p>
<p>sorry for length.</p></p>
