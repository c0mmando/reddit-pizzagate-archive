<p><p>If you're like me, it's a bit tough to talk to people about the horrifying reality of this scandal. It's easier if they redpill themselves, which is why I compiled these links. They're intended to slowly lift back the curtain for your friends and families. Feel free to make any changes to it (file is here https://dropfile.to/qrsLOLN).</p></p>

<p><p>Hey, sorry to hijack, but what happened to some of the best research on here? I thought it was stickied and up on the TOP section? Has it migrated elsewhere? It was like pleadingtheyiff's material and stuff similar where there was real great compilations...</p></p>

<p><p>No worries man. My guess is it all got deleted. I used what 
I considered the two best summaries of this horror show, and threw in a bunch of links to mainstream news stories so the average person is less skeptical. </p></p>

<p><p>Sorry, I forgot to mention that I grabbed it and thanks! I was thinking it would be great to do a online powerpoint with all the links and images. It would be great to source the high res stuff and get all the material from the very first bread crumbs and build it up in a sequence of events and connections.</p></p>

<p><p>No reason to be sorry man. I'm with you on the PowerPoint thing. Few tips; first, get them to recognize that there are sick people out there. Most people are uncomfortable with the concept of evil, never mind evidence of it. Mainstream media reports on pedo rings is one way to start.
Second, show them the kind of weird shit these ping pong fuckers have posted. Focus on the creepiest comments, but don't oversell it. Admit that they might just be weird dudes. Third, mention the cryptic email references, that make zero sense unless they're actually talking in pedo code. Then, expose them to the skeptics. There's a ton of "reporters" that try to debunk this whole fiasco. But instead of using logic/evidence, they attack our credibility (ie we're just homophobic racists pushing fake news). That's what gives them away - their reactions.</p></p>
