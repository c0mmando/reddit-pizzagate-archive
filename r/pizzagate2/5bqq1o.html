<p><p>My one big concern is that this is making the FBI's job harder. Also, nobody has a victim, eye witnesses, or specific events that occurred and that is crucial to building an actual case. It's all circumstantial; but it does paint a very compelling picture. A bunch of you dorks let them know you're on to them, and now they're likely tying up their known loose ends. </p></p>

<p>Seems like the FBI can't do shit, this thing is massive, I'm thinking over 100,000 people involved in this ring, best we can do is kill them in the court of public opinion, people don't take kindly to pedophilia. I think it's best to keep pushing and reseaching.</p></p>

<p><p>Wow. Very well put together. This makes me wonder about the recent FBI pedophile ring bust earlier this year. All of the information in this post is showing that this high-profile pedophile ring predates the internet so I think that they would be set up in a way that wouldn't require it and as such probably have no online presence whatsoever (or at least none now after all of these Wikileaks.) </p>
<p>By not interfering with FBI hacking and online stings they would be letting their competition get eliminated. I also think that they are operating offline because interfering with digital investigations is much more difficult than interfering with physical investigations which require court approval and are limited to jurisdictions.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm new to Reddit but had to get on to share some research. Been looking into that Heavy Breathing band that was "Friend #1" at Comet Ping Pong. I found a live video from last year (includes jokes about Jared Fogle raping kids) https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kX8xI6TPFnI
Also of interest is that it was shot by an Ari Srabstein. Looking through his videos I came across a very disturbing original film he made. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hzg_6wfU7JU</p>
<p>Just started digging but "Night Jest" and "Jester Mercutio" might be something. Again fairly new, don't know how to archive and shit</p></p>

<p><p>Might be nothing but on Ari Srabstein's Facebook he said he was an intern at Flying V theater group in DC. Their website is semi-creepy but I found on the donors page under $250 the first name is "&amp;Pizza" http://www.flyingvtheatre.com/become-awesome/our-donors/</p></p>

<p><blockquote>
<p>Many victims in their interviews cited being forced to participate in satanic rituals, and had named King as a participant. What I hope I have laid out here is that there are certainly child prostitution rings in the United States and that kids are transported across the country for high profile customers.</p>

<p><p>I have a theory: </p>
<p>What if they purposely gave the illusion of it being a satanic ritual to discredit their victim's testimony if they ever came forward? It just sounds like something out of a bad 90s movie. But why would pedophilia be so widespread amongst our leaders? Mutual blackmail. The only way to be trusted and get into their inner circle would be through these "satanic rituals."</p></p>

<p><p>Hijacking to say while I believe the Dutroux Affair is legit, I believe the McMartin Preschool case is disinformation.  It is promoted by former <strong>FBI Chief</strong> Ted Gunderson, who has been linked to Temple of Set and Michael Aquino (of Presidio military base abuse case). It is actually a well-known case where very young children (remember these were preschoolers) made up stories of abuse because they felt pressured by the interviewers.  Claims of "false memories" will surely be used to deflect attention from real cases of abuse, but this is the legitimate case of false memories that spawned the whole concept of false memory syndrome.</p>
<p><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/30/magazine/tm-mcmartin44">Here is one of the kids apologizing as an adult.</a></p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMartin_preschool_trial#Interviewing_and_examining_the_children</p>
<p>"Transcripts and recordings of the interviews contained far more speech from adults than children and demonstrated that, despite the highly coercive interviewing techniques used, initially the children were resistant to interviewers' attempts to elicit disclosures. <strong>Recordings of these interviews were instrumental in the jury's refusal to convict, by demonstrating how children could be coerced to giving vivid and dramatic testimonies without having experienced the abuse.[18] The techniques used were contrary to the existing guidelines in California for the investigation of cases involving children and child witnesses.[19]"</strong></p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMartin_preschool_trial#Bizarre_allegations</p>
<p>"Some of the accusations were described as "bizarre",[5] overlapping with accusations that mirrored the just-starting satanic ritual abuse panic.[4] It was alleged that, in addition to having been sexually abused, they saw witches fly, traveled in a hot-air balloon, and were taken through underground tunnels.[4] When shown a series of photographs by Danny Davis (the McMartins' lawyer), one child identified actor Chuck Norris as one of the abusers.[20]</p>
<p>Some of the abuse was alleged to have occurred in secret tunnels beneath the school. Several excavations turned up evidence of old buildings on the site and other debris from before the school was built, but <strong>no evidence of any secret chambers or tunnels was found</strong>.[4] <strong>There were claims of</strong> orgies at car washes and airports, and of <strong>children being flushed down toilets to secret rooms</strong> where they would be abused, then cleaned up and presented back to their parents. Some interviewed children talked of a game called "naked movie star" suggesting they were forcibly photographed nude.[1][4][21] During the trial, testimony from the children stated that the naked movie star game was actually a rhyming taunt used to tease other children – "What you say is what you are, you're a naked movie star," – and had nothing to do with having naked pictures taken.[4]</p>
<p><strong>Johnson, who made the initial allegations, made bizarre and impossible statements about Raymond Buckey, including that he could fly.[1] Though the prosecution asserted Johnson's mental illness was caused by the events of the trial, Johnson had admitted to them that she was mentally ill beforehand."</strong></p></p>
