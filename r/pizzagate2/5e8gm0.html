<strong>Is there a way...</strong>
<p><p>To broaden this investigation for folks who want to just do gumshoe police work? I posted here about a week ago when this was just getting legs, and since then it seems to have been taken over by conspiracy theorists. Don't get me wrong, questioning everything is a sound tactic, but when outsiders come here and see some of the bat-shit crazy theories and actual CP links, it doesn't help the cause. </p>
<p>Call me a shill, or CTR, or whatever makes you feel better, but I have put actual criminals and child predators in prison. And 90% of the posts here aren't how you accomplish that. I would be all in if we could cut the BS. I am not in a position of authority anymore (diff career now), to be fair, but I know my way around a criminal investigation. And it resembles nothing being done here. </p></p>

<p><p>The people you're talking about are shills, not "conspiracy theorists". This is the ultimate conspiracy theory.</p></p>

<p><p>Sex crimes investigations are rarely this intricate, but some are. How many have those calling me a troll done? I was proposing that other real life investigators get involved, but why bother when the go-to response to the slightest criticism of how this is being done is met with this kind of paranoid vitriol? </p></p>

<p><p>The issue is when people come off as trying to dictate how others should behave. Combine that with a lot of the crazy material surrounding this whole thing, and you're gonna have a lot of people on edge when they feel like others are trying to 'control' them. So this kind of reaction should not come as a surprise.</p>
<p>The only way to gather any kind of support for a real thorough investigation (which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e2hb9/a_definitive_guide_to_staying_safe/">I'm all for</a> by the way), is to stop criticizing all the "conspiracy theorists". Like it or not, they're here to stay, and may occasionally even provide new leads. But demonizing them is just going to create huge unproductive divisiveness and paranoia. We should be trying to figure out ways to take advantage of the fact that we have so much momentum right now, not trying to fight it. </p>
<p>And we're fighting it for what really? We don't need <em>that</em> many people doing heavy legwork. If even 1% of the current subscribers signed up to do serious investigation work, that's still over 200 people at your disposal. We don't need to be throwing the other +20k people under the bus for that, as it's only gonna bite us in the ass in the long run if we try. Serious investigators are outnumbered here whether they like it or not (just like they would be in any other general population), and trying to go against this tide instead of harnessing it is counter-productive.</p>
<p>As for credibility, the concrete results of a serious thorough investigation by a handful of people should be more than enough to make up for all the theorizing. Just remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20 rule</a>: 80% of the impact will likely come from 20% of the information.</p></p>

<p><p>That's the power of a collective group of anonymous private citizens... we can do things the real police can't. We will never be the ones to slap the cuffs on a criminal... but we sure as hell can speculate our balls off in ways that no real cop would ever be allowed to pursue. If you expect a bunch of internet randos to conduct a professional investigation down to the letter... it ain't gonna happen. </p></p>

<p><p>I agree, man, but you can't make a case like that. One hand has to be in sync with the other. Speculation doesn't stop a little kid from being raped. Maybe if "internet randos" would join effort with randos with investigative experience, we could document this down to the letter. You give WAAAAAY too much credit to "real police". I was real police for many years and my intellect is no better than yours or anyone else looking into this. </p>
<p>Stop throwing up that wall.</p></p>

<p><p>Speculation does stop a child from being raped if a couple dozen randos ring up a place everyday and ask them if they are raping kids... I bet they stop raping kids pretty quickly. </p>
<p>So... what exactly are you suggesting we do differently? Spell it out for me. </p></p>

<p><p>Honestly I'm thinking of starting my own site for such a purpose. Or start your own IRC channel or something. It's certainly doable in this day and age.</p></p>
