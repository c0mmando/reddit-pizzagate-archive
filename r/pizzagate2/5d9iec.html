<p><p>We have been suffering from these kind of stuff for years, not at that elite level but there have been some serious child molesting issues and these cases were closed immediately, since these were usually religous kind of freaks and government did not want to take any heat.</p>
<p>And there is also a thing about turkish people easily being on fire when something that disgusting/disturbing happens.</p></p>

<p><p>Ah I see. I wouldn't be so sure that your deep state isn't/wasn't corrupted with this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Btw a little bird said that there are preparations for something big in Turkey in the near future.</p>
<p>And yah, Turks can get on fire about things! The Young Turks (both back in the day and the ones on YT) are known for that. Welcome to the investigation!</p></p>

<p><p>We are the small fish (maybe medium-sized), our government officials all use apple products&amp;gmail and all other technically traceable stuff, so any scandal type of thing will come out (as they did so many times). And thanks!</p></p>

<p><p>Not bla bla. And we do not know english, if you want to read the details of the news in turkish we can follow you on our site. We did not do well because we were the most read of the news in the country. The big news sites in Turkey made news about this subject. They actually had to do as twitter tt. But I do not think it will ever be on television. A more free media is needed for this, but as you are in our media, the American government controls it too much.</p></p>

<p><p>Pizzzagate is the most talked about trend topic on Twitter yesterday
People were shocked, especially for Obama ..
People do not want to believe, but they think the American people have to react. if this is true
They even want all facts to come out in some way.
And everybody who has a suicide joint get punished</p></p>
