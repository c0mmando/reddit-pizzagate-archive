<strong>What this sub needs are "expert" voices on DID and talking to witnesses/victims.</strong>
<p><p>Not necessarily psychiatrists/psychologists, but people who have experience with those who have DID in general. Many people do not understand what this disorder is about and if and when some of you come across victims willing to speak, you will likely be talking to someone who has this disorder.</p>
<p>Because Trauma of the nature we are speaking of results in dissociative states that persist throughout the life of the victim, when you are speaking to a victim, you are not speaking to just one individual, you are speaking to a "system" of personalities in one body. Not everybody in the system knows the answers to the questions you will ask. Some know "everything". Some will run away, some will lash out. Alters only identify with the set of memories they personally hold so only one/some alters will even remember speaking to you.</p>
<p>This is a very complex subject matter and because of the suppression of information regarding DID, few people know what it really means and many remain sceptical it exists. The Elite have gone to incredible lengths to cover this disorder up entirely because the victims of it are also the key to their destruction. If you have not yet, research the False Memory Syndrome Foundation. This foundation Exists to  cover up the reality of their crimes.</p></p>

<p><p>I agree. I am going to talk to a potential victim Monday and hopefully record an interview. 
I didn't have any suspension on DID until he talked on the subject of his abuse. He definitely went into a different headspace. 
When reading this sub, he was very emotional and outraged. When talking about his own abuse he was very frank and distant. He would get easily irritated by my questions. He would randomly change his mind about telling me something mid sentence. Completely unlike him. 
Is it possible to only show symptoms of DID when talking about abuse and not have it effect your day to day?</p></p>

<p><p>DID, for most, will effect their day to day life to some degree, even if its what most people would simply add up to being abesnt minded or forgetful. For some, the effects come and go. There can be days, weeks or years of alters being "dormant", while other people experience the symptoms non-stop. The main thing is Safety. Alters are triggered to appear according to their function and their immediate need in a person's life, whether it is stress and memory triggers or an actual programmed "pass word" (these can also be symbols, phrases, light flashes, just about anything.)</p>
<p>Your friend sounds as if he switched between alters and some were more willing to share than others. Some are probably more sad while others are furious. Let them express, each their own way, and let them know they're safe to do so.</p>
<p>The most fundamental fact about DID is that it exists to be covert. Very few people who have it are Obvious in normal interactions. That is what both keeps the victim "safe" and, unfortunately, also the perpetrators. </p></p>

<p><p>I was really horribly raped and I am still trying to recover from it emotionally. </p>
<p>I find it really upsetting when people start asking me questions. I want to be able to just tell what I want to tell about it, I don't want to be grilled. Which is pretty much exactly how I feel when questioned. It can make me loose my cool very quickly. </p></p>
