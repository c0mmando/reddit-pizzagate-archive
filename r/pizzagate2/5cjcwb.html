<strong>Code Word Sources?</strong>
<p><p>Hi, guys. Are there any better sources on the pedo code words than "4chan says so"? </p>
<p>When showing the leaked emails to friends, they quickly agree that there is some form of code being spoken. But I am having trouble getting them on board with the pedo theories without better sources on the code words.</p></p>

<p><p>I've had this issue too. If they agree they are codewords, I would just then link podesta to the owner of the pizza place. Then show them the Instagram posts he's made, particularly the overtly sexual pizza related ones. Show them the tunnels, the weird torture room thing. Then show them Obama, Michelle, Hillary and podesta all at the place etc. (I've got a good list of links if you ever need a quick reference to everything that's out there) . Then have them read the emails again. Not sure if that'll help or not but that's usually how I've approached it and the few people I've told agreed that it was sketch as shit and the owner of the pizza place was a pedophiliac. </p>
<p>Also, the logo, and the fact they changed it is a dead give away and one of the better pieces of evidence I know of that we have. </p></p>

<p><p>Thank you, that seems like a good approach.</p>
<p>It was the fact that the logo symbol is backed up by a FBI document that made me want for a stronger source on the codewords in the first place. Thats the kind of stuff that gets my sceptic friends attention.</p></p>

<p><p>Dont think theres any direct evidence, besides the fact that they seem to be speaking in code.</p>
<p>But it wouldn't be the first time there was some high-level pedophile ring:</p>
<p>http://archive.is/20161104012145/pastebin.com/Jn2LfXg4 (This has alot of stuff, havent read fully yet.)</p>
<p>http://blackbag.gawker.com/uh-did-we-finish-looking-into-those-1-700-pentagon-chi-1609060355</p>
<p>Also the fact that Clinton's/Podesta's seem to be surrounded with people who are known pedophiles: Jeffrey Epstein, Dennis Hastert, and now Anthony Weiner investigation. </p>
<p>One good link between possible child-trafficking and Clinton's seem to be Laura Silsby:  http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf (page8).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of Clintonâ€™s first tasks in Haiti, however, was to put out the fire of a child abduction scandal involving American citizens. On January 29, 2010, less than three weeks after the earthquake, Haitian authorities arrested ten U.S. Baptist missionaries for attempting to take 33 children by bus across the border into the Dominican Republic without proper documentation.
In the course of a month, President Clinton brokered the release of all the missionaries, except for the group leader, Laura Silsby.</p>
