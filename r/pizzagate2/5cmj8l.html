<p><p>This is a very solid piece of evidence that someone picked up from 8chan. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xon1546ZwDs">video</a> of someone reading through the book. Needless to say it ticks all our boxes. There's an intriguing bit in this article <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/11/04/erik-prince-nypd-ready-make-arrests-weiner-case/">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“NYPD was the first one to look at that laptop,” Prince elaborated. “Weiner and Huma Abedin, his wife – the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years – have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They both have – they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clinton’s own homebrew server, which contained classified information. Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found.”</p>
<p>“So NYPD first gets that computer. They see how disgusting it is. They keep a copy of everything, and they pass a copy on to the FBI, which finally pushes the FBI off their chairs, making Comey reopen that investigation, which was indicated in the letter last week. The point being, NYPD has all the information, and they will pursue justice within their rights if the FBI doesn’t,” Prince contended.</p>
<p>“The Justice Department is trying to run out the clock, to elect Hillary Clinton, to prevent any real justice from being done,” he warned. As for the mayor of New York City, Prince said he has heard that “de Blasio wants to stay away from this.”</p>
<p><strong>“The evidence is so bad, the email content is so bad, that I think even he wants to stay away from it, which is really telling,” he said.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very telling. </p></p>

<p><p>Ugh, that video.  The book is definitely creepy and I can see the relation.</p>
<p>None the less I don't think this implicates DeBlasio at all.</p></p>

<p><p>From the article:</p>
<p>“The book was neither fun nor cute,” mom Jen Bee wrote on Amazon. “Yeah, that’s not what I want to teach my child. It sounds like something a <strong>pedophile</strong> would say to their victim.”</p>
<p>This article is them mocking everyone. Placing little Easter eggs, having fun among themselves. Like the old Podesta interview "when I'll retire I'll open a hot dog stand in Hawaii". Or the other one where Tony Podesta talked about an "underground vault" in his house to watch "problematic videos". </p>
<p>Now that we have the Rosetta stone, now that we know their codewords, we can revisit everything they've ever said publicly.</p>
<p>Thank you OP for this nugget. Conclusion of the find: de Blasio and at least 1 of the 2 journalists (Denis Slattery / Dale W. Eisinger) are likely pedocriminals. <a href="http://archive.is/eN7UB">Here is the archived article</a> fyi.</p></p>

<p>Bill DeBlasio looking to talk to Podesta over the phone instead of email?</p>

<p><p>So the author wrote another book called "Dragons love tacos" and talks about taco parties. Could that be code for anything?</p></p>

<p><p>Great find! I did some follow-up work looking into the author. Definitely some odd topics. I wonder if there is more symbolism in the other works? </p>
