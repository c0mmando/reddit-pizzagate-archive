<p><p>There may be some people here better at cyber and cybering than Barron, but we would be unwise to forsake him so early in the game.  <a href="http://m.imgur.com/LRNRktx">Barron has been playing 14 dimensional, intergalactic chess since he could walk.</a> </p>
<p>He's moving everyone here into a position of attack while the enemy is on the defensive. </p>
<p>We don't even realize it yet and neither do they, but he's moving one of us into position to deliver the killshot. </p>
<p>Praise be to Barron, his glory upon you for a thousand years. </p></p>
