        <p><p>Please stop looking into the site lhohq. It's just a troll website. All of it is nonsense. All of it is public information. 4chan, 8chan have looked into this site many years ago and multiple times. </p></p>

        <p><p>All have small children or older children. Maybe google translate is just shitty but I am getting "Top beds, wider than normal and are delicious" for one review.</p></p>

        <p><p>not all of them have children, one review is from a german guy who seemed to be there solo and the only contra he got was that there wasnt a german TV channel, and they even answered that they cant change it.
i translated most of them aswell and it rly looks like normal reviews.. the food was delicious, there are activities for childrens (someone mentioned it in a review) and for sure big size bedÂ´s are always good :P
Stay calm dude, dont get paranoid.
maybe watch something funny or play some games for a bit.
Dont let them get you like this.. </p></p>

        <p><p>lhohq is at best a troll site and at worst a honeypot that's logging your IP and putting you on a kill list</p>
<p>tor/vpn won't protect you. They control all of that.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah I highly doubt thats was the purpose of that website. It's most likely a distraction and just to F with people. Weren't all of those contacts leaked by Guccifer?</p></p>
