<p><p>What a terrible article.</p>
<p>Won't the pizza-douche just explain his bizarre Instagram activity? Way to conveniently leave all that out. </p></p>

<p><p>I agree. I wonder why people just don't read the original Wilileaks'
Podesta emails?</p></p>

<p><p>That's what we need to point to. The instagram posts &amp; visuals are what blew this up, that's what will get peoples' attention. They're not covered in any of these articles. </p></p>

<p><p>The Instagram posts are probably all coincidences or total misinterpretations based on paranoia or bad research. </p></p>

<p><p>Nearly all of the IG photos of children have explicit and sexual comments/captions - not to mention how much these people seem to enjoy pedo-art. Even if the photo's themselves aren't that bad (taping a child to the table is humourous to some) there seems to be something sinister hidden in it, especially considering Alefantis will not comment on it.</p></p>

<p><p>I can't find it now but there was a post a couple weeks ago where somebody found the girls (who's name is Caris) parents on Facebook. They have more recent photos of her and she is alive and well from what we can tell.</p></p>

<p><p>OMG..you're so right.  I was shocked to see the DM but it is ironic. I wish people would read the emails themselves in WikiLeaks.</p></p>

<p><p>You are right, of course, but the fact that it is in Daily Mail points up the absurdity of the topic, shearing it completely from the realm of possibility. Nobody's reading the Wikileaks' emails themselves. I am on mobile phone and hung up w/work.</p></p>

<p><p>They've begun constructing the fake news =/= pizzagate scandal. They cite this started from a fake news website - we all know that is incorrect, it started in r/the_donald and 4chan and then moved over here. This might suggest the MSM is complicit and the fake news story was constructed to nullify our investigation.</p></p>

<p><p>I read the WikiLeaks emails...I'm sorry but I don't recall the sub.  There is WikiLeaks publication of Podesta brothers direct emails, art depictions, emails from those on Hillary's staff. Clinton is referred to as HRC  There are many oblique references in the emails to the unthinkable.  You come away with a very heavy, disturbed heart. The emails themselves were dropped well before this fake news thing which is being carried out to obscure the original WikiLeaks documents themselves. go to the source, the emails themselves.</p></p>

<p><p>'I've done nothing for days but try to clean this up and protect my staff and friends from being terrorized.'</p>
<p>Ummmm. This hasn't been going on for days, this has been going on for coming up on a month now. They have been balls to the walls covering this up and just started to come out publicly against it after they covered everything up. </p></p>

<p><p>Yes, great point. The Pizzagate phenom stems completely from the original WikiLeaks emails of John Podesta, his brother, Clinton staff in State Dept.,Bill and Chelsea Clinton, Foundation staff, etc. It is completely self-explanatory. President-Elect Trump is quoted today as saying "Hillary has had it rough in many different ways. I don't want to prosecute the Clintons." I agree. They are facing a lot of blowback already from pay-to-play Foundation emails, which are also self-explanatory. Contributions have lowered. For Hill and Bill, the sky IS falling...on its own, no fake news help needed.</p></p>

<p><p>Snopes also came out and said that the whole spirit cooking with podesta is false, so them taking the time to write a whole article about how it is false, is just validation that it is true. </p></p>

<p><p>I love how they leave out the creepy ass sexualized for minors art, the creepy ass band that plays there, the pizza codewords from the Podesta emails, the money he received from political groups and soros, Podestas weird ass spirit cooking classes, Podestas weird ass cannibal art in his office, and the fucking creepy instagram comments for the pictures of kids (not to mention the giant penis ejaculating pizza slices).</p>
