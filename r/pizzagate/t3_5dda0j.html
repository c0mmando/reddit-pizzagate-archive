<p><p>They realize that if they are being bombarded with pedophilia accusations by LOTs of people (and by lots, I mean they are dominating the comments), people will start to think, "hmmm.....you know, theres an aweful lot of people on here talking about pedophilia accusations. Is there maybe something to it?". </p>
<p>Skeptics, ask yourself this.</p>
<p>What is the more plausible scenario?</p>
<p>A. People interested in pizzagate are absolutely bat shit nuts, their argument holds no water, they are dead wrong on every argument they have brought to light, and Comet Ping Pong is a family friendly organization that just has pizza and games. The Clinton connection is probably nothing, and Soro's donation is likely blown out of proportion. The people implicated should be immediately cleared, and we should all apologize. </p>
<p>or </p>
<p>B. The skeptics are onto something. Some very intelligent and skilled people, who have dedicated countless hours to examining the wikileaks with a fine toothed comb, have observed several leaked documents/emails involving Podesta that contain common sex ring "code words". Further investigation into Podesta exposed a link to a D.C. Pizza parlor, opening up several new leads, and upon following those leads, more intriguing information was found that connected some of our most prominent and respected public servants to the Pizza Parlor. An investigation into the owner of this pizza parlor revealed that his character is questionable, and some of his strange antics would fit the "pedophile ring" narrative (lude twitter photos).  Their findings were deemed significant enough to justify further investigation.</p>
<p>So you're essentially either saying; We're dead wrong and nuts, or we're onto something? Is Option B Really that hard to imagine?  </p>
<p>Enough evidence and connections have been made to justify further investigation, thats all I'm saying. Isn't this how the police and FBI operate? Just because John Gacy was a well respected member of his community and involved in local plitics, the Police shouldn't have investigated further? </p>
<p>We're dealing with pedophilia and some very powerful people for christ's sake, and we have a legitimate argument to make. At least hear us out. Immediately denouncing us and encouraging us to stop just seems pretty ignorant to me.</p></p>
