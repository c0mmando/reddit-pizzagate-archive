<strong>Here is an encouraging thought regarding Pizzagate</strong>
<p><p>They must be scared shittless and here is why:
I think we all can agree that those people are massively into satanism and ritualistic sacrifice.</p>
<p>Now imagine some stuff surfaces to the light of day (Podesta e-mails) and suddenly a shitstorm ensues. Hundereds of thousands of KEK-worshippers start investigating and shitposting
and are all over their asses. KEK as in FROG ! </p>
<p>Since they are into symbolism it must look like a freaking frog plage 2.0 to them. They must think that the WRATH OF GOD is about to come down on them.</p>
<p>Now since they are cowards and psycologicaly unstable i could imagine someone losing his shit and finally comming foward in the near future if we keep up the preassure.</p>
<p>Keep digging friends. The forces of good are on our side !</p></p>

<p>Has anyone else seen these? Pretty sure I got it off 8chan last night(might have been 4 I'm sleep deprived), I'm like 99% sure OP said these were hidden in the pizza pic. I made a post but it's not showing up in new. I have back ups if archive. Org really is compromised, am I going crazy? These are creepy as fuck pics to me but I'm not seeing anyone else talk about or mention them and I can't find original thread I got them from. </p>
<p>Edit:Album includes lots of pics of kids and babies, two teenage(like 14?15?) boys in wheelchairs vacation pictures, random furniture, young attractive woman walking down the street looks like paparazzi shots or something (pretty sure someone said it was bill gates daughter last night), a parking lot, a dead/skinned pig, and some sort of unholy corrupted data looking thing? I swear it moves when I look at it, a skype chat with podesta and 2 other people. </p>
<p>Edit 2: I found the thread I got these from, it has been deleted.</p>

<p><p>I think we need to try and reach any current victims that aren't already programmed, but the issue there is that I imagine these victims are locked away and secure. Most likely isolated from communication or media. TBH what we need is legal action in the form of subpoenas for banking records and property searches.</p></p>

<p><p>I was a Christian for 20 years until just last year. I still believe a God exists, but I believe him to be cruel. I'm not going to argue with you about God though, because I don't want to drive people from this subreddit. Believe what you will, and good luck searching for stuff!</p></p>

<p><p>If this investigation isn't the hand of God at work then I don't know what is. Maybe I'm just too spooked by all this and need to maintain faith for when they inevitably track down and fucking kill all of us for investigating this. Good luck to you as well. </p></p>

<p><p>The Catholic church is referred to as the false prophet by scripture. Get a new world translation and give it another read. Have faith in our creator. He has given us a book that foretold all of this.  Even that evil men would come in his name. I know it sounds wishy washy  but keep faith in the creator. Don't let your distrust of man rob you of a relationship most valuble. </p></p>

<p><p>I'm telling everyone that it was all created by Tavistock. All of our history and education to lull us into a false understanding of how time works, they literally created the concept of linear time. All of our western civilization history and culture was also created by them to have us think a certain way and "polarize" our thoughts. It's all pretty fucked.</p></p>

<p><p>So tavistock has been around since the holy Roman empire? Babylon? It can't all be lies there is a lot of archaeological evidence to support the existence of ancient civilizations. They probably want people to doubt the existence of God because this gives them power over people...</p></p>

<p><p>I think they simply created our history to fit their needs, the problem is with how they set things up it's impossible to know. A big part of their thing was to put the idea of there either being no god, or one surpreme god. They limit our thinking by setting our education system up so that our minds think everything only has two choices, the polarization allows them to direct our thoughts into an endless web we never reach the end of until our death. </p>
<p>I think we'll be able to start using the rest of our brain once the polarization starts to fade, they want a dumbed down mass that's easy to manipulate but no one is actually "dumb" or "smart", that concept was created by them too. Everything was to create separation between us so that we never direct our anger at who's actually responsible for everything</p></p>

<p><p>I don't know man, God spoke to me once during a super intense mushroom trip and told me "perception is everything" not sure if that meant consciousness controls the world at a quantum level or what, but it seems that the more we bring these evil people to light, the more power we have via memetics.</p></p>

<p><p>It's true, it's all part of a grand process. We are a part of everything but split into sub entities viewing the grand creation via different perspectives. All that's been hidden from us for so long is finally coming to light, https://www.espavo.org/beacons/ has been pretty on point for a while, supposedly by January 17th the energy should be stabilized. There are LOTS of things happening right now outside of our little consciousness bubble. </p></p>

<p><p>Welp, I guess we as little ants compared to the grand scheme of things can't do much but hold on and hope for the best. Not sure what you mean by stabilizing energy though. Like what, is humanity supposed to have some sort of global epiphany? Ascension to a higher dimension? </p></p>

<p><p>It's gonna be a ride, global epiphanies and mass awakening of consciousness I believe. We don't really know but that looks like where things are headed from my point of view. We're little ants right now but will soon all realize our true powers that've been hidden from us for so long. Did you know you can dissolve a cloud with your thoughts? That's just the beginning. Everyone's going to start viewing things from a 5-dimensional perspective rather than a 3-dimensional perspective. </p></p>

<p><p>Religion clearly ties into all of this, understanding of the occult and their hatred for mankind, as opposed to the principles of religion and concepts of love, morality etc. I'm not necessarily proselytizing, so much as trying to wake people up to the deeper meanings, if you have not studied the Bible, then you will fail to see the relation to the book of revelations, and ancient religions. This is pure evil we are dealing with here.</p></p>

<p><p>There's a big difference between asking people to study the Bible and the occult academically (which I actually really do agree is a good idea!), and literally saying "convert to Christianity". I'll assume you made an honest mistake, but please use your words more carefully next time, thank you. </p></p>

<p><p>Specifically, I ask that people believe in a higher power that is guiding us to be good, moral beings that aren't totally savage like these sick, disgusting people. If it's Christianity, then go for it, all religion points to the same idea really, the polarity of life, good vs evil, light and dark. I've lived Godlessness my entire life and I can honestly say, it leads to mental illness, specifically a feeling of hopelessness, being lost, fear of death etc. I just want people to live good lives, if we all did that, then we wouldn't have found ourselves in the mess that we currently find ourselves in.</p></p>

<p><p>Yes, allegations from you. </p>
<p>People take tons of pictures of kids. Every picture I've taken over the last ten years has been of my daughters or their lovely mother. Every picture I have received in that time frame either via mms or email has been from family and friends sending me pictures of their kids.</p>
<p>I was onboard with this thing and super suspicious but the thing is crumbling quickly. There is just nothing substantive there and if the other "evidence" is as flimsy as this has turned out to be, maybe find another witch to hunt.</p></p>

<p><p>From above; "I am just reposting something I found that was being discussed in a thread that I can't find anymore."</p>
<p>From your opening post; "They must be scared shittless and here is why: I think we all can agree that those people are massively into satanism and ritualistic sacrifice."</p>
<p>Not quite an accurate representation of the facts. I'm not attacking you. Just be more responsible with the language you use. There has been much talk of sites being compromised. Do you think that cannot or will not happen with reddit? You're posting a lot of information about people, many of whom are private citizens, and photos of their children while making statements such as you did above. How long do you think Reddit will allow this to go on? They have to protect themselves as well.</p>
<p>Just be more responsible before you blow it for everyone.</p></p>
