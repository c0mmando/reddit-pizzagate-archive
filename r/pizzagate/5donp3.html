    Weird lyrics in Songs written by 'The Apes', (Majestic Ape)
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Hey, I already posted this in another thread, but I've kinda been exploring the lyrics to the songs of The Apes, I had already uncovered that the lyrics of their songs are nowhere to be found, despite the fact that they're a band that's on spotify, signed with a record label, has 5 albums, and has apparently collaborated with multiple artists. It seems a bit fishy to me.
   </p>
   <p>
    One of their albums is called Baba's mountain. It was uncovered in another thread that this was referring to a child molester called 'Baba'. But you can read about that here
   </p>
   <p>
    https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dkup9/a_chilling_video_with_sexual_torture_infants/
   </p>
   <p>
    Anyway I have tried to figure out three of their song lyrics and they all sound quite fishy to me. And maybe, some of you can hear things I couldn't quite make out, or maybe some have found other weird lyrics? I realize there might not be too much to this anyway, but I found it interesting to explore nonetheless. Anyway, here's what I wrote down in the other thread.
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit: I decided that this song had to be at the top, because it is definitely the weirdest I have found so far.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Children of brainbrow-brainbro
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Fountain of hundreds we miss(??)
   </p>
   <p>
    So many children in a village like this
   </p>
   <p>
    Boys and girls, (long haired??) dwellers
   </p>
   <p>
    Home of the good (goods/boobs??) and countless sellers  (woah)
   </p>
   <p>
    Child to captain, are we here to stay? '
   </p>
   <p>
    Lair (??) on no hands, to lead us astray
   </p>
   <p>
    Too bloated brains, brains without bodies
   </p>
   <p>
    Their mental powers, controlling the parties (pizza parties/political parties? who knows)
   </p>
   <p>
    Far, far, far from your cities
   </p>
   <p>
    They're building robot bodies to spread disease
   </p>
   <p>
    Black and white powers, patrolling the (marches??)
   </p>
   <p>
    Legence of lonely and rich who will march in
   </p>
   <p>
    Made with their hearts and you'll pay the Audis/odd ears??
   </p>
   <p>
    Truly the hooman that brains without bodies
   </p>
   <p>
    Far, far, far from your cities
   </p>
   <p>
    They're building robot bodies to spread disease
   </p>
   <p>
    But they're selling goods
   </p>
   <p>
    The bodies need completion
   </p>
   <p>
    A candle is lit for each new day
   </p>
   <p>
    And then they whisper a whole bunch of shit about children I cannot quite make out because the music is overpowering the voices.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Song: What we do best
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    'Come sit on my face
   </p>
   <p>
    While I'm knitting(????)
   </p>
   <p>
    The scalp(???) of your mother is one like no other
   </p>
   <p>
    Come take a walk but please don't speak
   </p>
   <p>
    We're now having (sex??) just follow my lead
   </p>
   <p>
    You see through your homes and you look through your things
   </p>
   <p>
    Just take what you need
   </p>
   <p>
    We do what we want and we go where we please
   </p>
   <p>
    entitlement doesn't come free.
   </p>
   <p>
    Cause this is what we do what we do best
   </p>
   <p>
    Well you feel like a frog, so jump in
   </p>
   <p>
    We'll cut off your tongues (?) for leaving the young
   </p>
   <p>
    And hence we saw hair (??) we sow'em back on(???)
   </p>
   <p>
    Then there is a line i dont understand but I swear it finishes with 
either:'We'll finish by dawn, or we'll finish your daughter
   </p>
   <p>
    We'll borrow your name for your magazines, a couple copies please (???)
   </p>
   <p>
    We do what we want and we go where we please, entitlement doesn't come free.
   </p>
   <p>
    Cause this is what we do, what we do best
   </p>
   <p>
    (the others?? ) are dead, so count yourself blessed
   </p>
   <p>
    We're walking, we're talking'
   </p>
   <p>
    walking, talking
   </p>
   <p>
    The price of living free, the price for you and me
   </p>
   <p>
    Cause this is what we do, what we do best.
   </p>
   <p>
    Others are dead, count yourself blessed.
   </p>
   <p>
    This song seems to be about a paedo who can finally live/walk around freely with a child over the street, maybe due to killing the parents, or stealing the child
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Song: Can u handle this
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Can you speak?
   </p>
   <p>
    You lost your brains to let us
   </p>
   <p>
    Strains of thought
   </p>
   <p>
    She set to 'yes sir' 'no sir'
   </p>
   <p>
    Can you pass(??) everyone here is talking
   </p>
   <p>
    Hot lips, pink ass grape flavoured licks (of mine?)
   </p>
   <p>
    The small owl's in hand??
   </p>
   <p>
    And you here will (be left alone ??)
   </p>
   <p>
    (you're young??) through the night
   </p>
   <p>
    Do you feel the transformation?
   </p>
   <p>
    Back in your home
   </p>
   <p>
    Alone in your bed
   </p>
   <p>
    Can you handle this? Can you handle that?
   </p>
   <p>
    Sacred trials??? Twisted smiles
   </p>
   <p>
    (Field chose??) with the unfortunate bangs
   </p>
   <p>
    Hosting pubic crabs
   </p>
   <p>
    Clinging  to you up a (horroring???)'
   </p>
   <p>
    But keep it up
   </p>
   <p>
    With the fire light bleeding
   </p>
   <p>
    As your locks are (brown?)  I pull you closer, closer
   </p>
   <p>
    Same chorus again
   </p>
   <p>
    And then you hear the majestic ape voice and I think she's saying:
   </p>
   <p>
    'So you come to see besides, or will you make it to daylight? '
   </p>
   <p>
    This song looks like its about an abused child growing up (maybe within the pedo ring) and now she/he has to decide whether to be part of it by joining in the abuse, or get herself killed off due to getting too old.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Song:Zookeeper's night out
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Ok Im busy with another one, called :'Zookeepers night out, this also sounds like it has fucked up lyrics in it, and it actually sounds like its threatening people who want to come forward about this.
   </p>
   <p>
    'When you leak the net with all
   </p>
   <p>
    I'll bring you down, to (crawl??)
   </p>
   <p>
    How many of these will lose the hunt????
   </p>
   <p>
    To cheap us out to lunch
   </p>
   <p>
    And now.. the time to feed..(the three/tree??) followed by animal growling noises
   </p>
   <p>
    The next line I just cannot make sense of, it doesn't sound like anything comprehensible
   </p>
   <p>
    'They're ratting out/acting out on whims
   </p>
   <p>
    Locked in gates, we need to be
   </p>
   <p>
    Took nude shots, take a peak
   </p>
   <p>
    Place your balls in the puss (ok what?)
   </p>
   <p>
    You want to talk, exclaim
   </p>
   <p>
    Let us decide your faith.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here to watch news/nudes, save you
   </p>
   <p>
    Nothing since last year
   </p>
   <p>
    Hand me more?? keys back these??
   </p>
   <p>
    Nothing since last year
   </p>
   <p>
    Here for one more, encore
   </p>
   <p>
    Nothing since last year
   </p>
   <p>
    Tried to hide the sin, but late
   </p>
   <p>
    (the cryptic sense facade??) makes no sense to me but can't fucking hear/understand it lo
   </p>
   <p>
    l Miss you so bad to go down, from letdown??
   </p>
   <p>
    Legs are so tired just sit this one out
   </p>
   <p>
    Please, be kind and mind my suit
   </p>
   <p>
    -------- Come to lunch???) checked out when you work it out?
   </p>
   <p>
    This song seems to be about threatening people who go after their precious pedo ring, or killing those off who risk to expose it due to reckless behavior.
   </p>
   <p>
    Anyway thats what I found, it might not mean much, but I thought to put it here nonetheless and perhaps get some feedback/contributions

    She has Dissociative identity disorder.  One of her identities is majik rape. Another is Andy klein, another still amanda. I think Amanda will confess soon. She is going to use the criminal insanity card and out her handlers

     What is your connection to her, roughly? Is she involved in any child trafficking or help facilitate it with her music as a cover? Was she ever a victim of abuse?
    </p>
    <p>
     What about her bandmates?

     I doubt an insanity defense would work. Unless she can prove she doesn't know the difference between right and wrong, the judge will throw it out.

     Heavy Breathing is her current band. The Apes aren't together anymore. Heavy Breathig has played Comet Ping Pong a bunch of times, and people have posted some videos of their appearances.
