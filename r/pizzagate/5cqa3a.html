    I was born and raised 5 minutes from McLean, Virginia.  They're all rich kids.  Their parents are all fucking loaded.  Every single kid I ever knew from McLean had a great fake ID.
   </p>
   <p>
    There's a lot of reaching going on here now.  Him getting drunk at a house party in high school that got busted doesn't have anything to do with what's going on here.  Further, it doesn't point to anything besides a normal suburban teenage life.  If there was some sort of sexual aspect or anything else alarming it'd be worth mentioning.
   </p>
   <p>
    You're way off track here.

     Point of this was to highlight a portion of his early criminal life. Some people grow to bigger crimes gradually, others don't. This wasn't a reach to his sexual life in anyway, rather his criminal life.
    </p>
    <p>
     No one has found a direct sexual connection solidifying him to little children, it has to be done in pieces. This is one piece of the puzzle. Right track building his life's timeline.

      Point taken, but this "criminal history" of him getting caught drunk with a fake id means nothing unless it was pled down or has some extenuating circumstances.

      No shill bro.

      What piece is going to be supported by this evidence?

       Might lead to somewhere where he may have changed his name or used a fake name or something since J'aime l'enfants was of French etymology meaning he likes boys. I can already see that he might have dropped the A from his middle name perhaps.

        A) If he had changed his name, it probably would have happened when he was older than 19.
       </p>
       <p>
        B) James Alefantis = j'etaime l'enfant theory has been pretty thoroughly discredited. Pierre l'enfant was the city planner for Washington DC, and the picture where James is where the shirt is outside of L'Enfant Cafe, whose music venue is the Boum Boum room.
