<p><p>This is another connection to a charity/organization which supposedly helps children:</p>
<ol>
<li>NPH-mexico.org</li>
<li>Hope of Guinea (Owner of Besta Pizza)</li>
<li>New Life Childrens Refugee (Laura Silsby, Haiti)</li>
</ol>
<p>And Beyond Borders (Haiti) is across the street of Comet and Besta.
Too much coincidences for my taste.</p></p>

<p><p>Yep its starting to look very bad.  These organizations are starting to appear as fronts for child trafficking.  What better way to child traffic then to own these organizations?  </p>
<p>Another one worth looking into is One Laptop Per Child.  It may be connected with Aaron's Swartz death.</p></p>

<p><p>The top two keep coming up all the time. There was a massive thread on (2) which got scrubbed, at the Abe guy (who is in the Podesta Wiki) put pressure on the mods here (he created an account and then deleted his posts).</p>
<p>Now we know why the russians banned Americans from adopting their children following the freezing of Russian assets. PUTIN knows!! THATS why he want's Trump. </p></p>

<p><p>Someone on voat mentioned the connection between Izette Folger and James Alefantis.  I started doing some digging and realized Innocents At Risk is a few miles away from Comet Ping Pong.  Izette servers on the advisory board.  Innocents at risk claims to work on protecting children from human trafficking.  They also have connections to an orphanage.   This may be a good lead and something to look into.  I would appreciate if all you could look into this and see if you find anything else.  This may be BIG.</p></p>

<p><p>Is this Folger related to the Folder clan,  as in Abigail Folger who was part of the Manson Tate/Labianca psyop?  If so these lunatics (basically any of these old money families who are all hooked into the Intel world) have a history of running false flags and other craziness to cover up their degenerate dig cartel and trafficking businesses. </p></p>

<p>If you scroll down to "President’s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons" it states: </p>
<p>"Tomorrow at the White House, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will chair the annual meeting of the President’s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons..." goes on to list other higher ups attending the meeting as well. </p>
<p>HRC is connected to this place in some form.</p>
<p>edit:"this place" meaning Innocents at Risk</p></p>

<p><p>I don't think that task force is directly from Innocents at Risk. Just Innocents at Risk website reporting about it. Still a good find though</p></p>
