        <p><p>Hmmmmm... people are already stealing #awakening for pizzagate talk... that might be an easier pill for the public to swallow than to try to tie it to amber alert...  #awakening is already in the top 10 trending. </p></p>

        <p><p>This is the worst idea of the day. </p>
<p>For the most part, we ignore those, but there are certain people that use those like law enforcement and a lot truck drivers. You literally want to avalanche a program meant to protect kids... </p>
<p>Shut up and dig. We need leg work, not shitty idea people. Stop being so lazy and go dig something up. </p></p>

        <p><p>Awakening the people on pizzagate is still a secondary objective of this sub/movement IMO. Many many people (esp. within the intellectually honest left) have awakened thanks to Spirit Cooking and Pizzagate. It is a very powerful "gateway meme"</p></p>

        <p><p>The problem, as I see it, is now we are broadcasting what we have and where we plan to go. They have the means to crush every one of us, if they know it's coming. Look what happened at WikiLeaks. They shut down half of the free worlds internet to block a dead man's switch from triggering. We need to have this shit locked tight before they can pull up the drawbridge. </p></p>
