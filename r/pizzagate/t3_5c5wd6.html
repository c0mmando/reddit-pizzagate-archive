<p>"Orange County, CA – The wealthy Ecuadorian Isaias family that owns DaVinci Biosciences and DV Biologics, which have been sued by the Orange County District Attorney’s office for illegally profiting from the sale of aborted baby tissue it obtained from Planned Parenthood, came to America under a cloud of criminal allegations and scandal.
The Isaias family, including brothers Roberto, William, and Estefano Sr., sought asylum in the U.S. in 2008, after looting millions of dollars from an Ecuadorian bank. These brothers brought with them their extended families – many of which are listed as principals of DaVinci Biosciences and DV Biologics."</p>
<p>"Andres Isaias, son of Estefano Isaias, Sr., is listed as President of both companies while his father and brother, Estefano Isaias, Jr., managed financial decisions and the books. Luis Isaias, son of Roberto Isaias, was also involved with the companies as were other relatives."</p>
<p>"During that time, the family made hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions to Democratic and Republican political campaigns. Family members gave roughly $300,000 to Democrat politicians alone and reached out to Hillary Clinton thru her aide, Cheryl Mills, according to the New York Times. In return, the family received favorable treatment from the Obama Administration and State Department under Clinton, which expedited their immigration into the U.S."</p>
<p>"The Clinton-led State Department resisted numerous requests by Ecuador to extradite the Isaias brothers back to their native country to face punishment."</p>
<p>"This protection of the Isaias fugitives strained relationships between the U.S. and Ecuador, which were already tense due to another perhaps better known fugitive. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange had sought asylum from Ecuador, which has since refused U.S. demands to force him from his sanctuary inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he continues to be a thorn in the side to the Obama Administration as well as Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign."</p>
<p>"While all this was happening in 2012, Isaias family members already in the U.S. contributed about $100,000 to the Obama Victory fund – conveniently timed to precede requests from the family with additional help to bring in Robert Isaias’s daughters, Estefania, and later, Maria, into the country."</p>
<p>"American diplomats had designated the sisters as “alien smugglers,” and accused them of bringing maids and other household workers into the country using false visas then leaving them at their family’s posh Coral Gables, Florida, home. A ban was placed on their immigration.
Nevertheless, after additional large donations to the Obama campaign and to New Jersey’s Democratic Senator Robert Mendez, who aggressively intervened with the State Department on their behalf even though the family lived in Florida, not New Jersey, the ban was lifted and the women were allowed into the U.S."</p>
<p>"In addition to the protection of the U.S. government that their large contributions had bought, the Isaias family had another very lucrative reason to come to America. The family has numerous business holdings adding to their vast wealth that included bioscience, telecommunications, and real estate markets."</p>
<p>"The Isaias baby parts businesses shipped the remains of aborted American babies all over the world..."</p>
<p>"The Isaias family continues to enjoy a wealthy high life in America, safe in the knowledge that their fortunes — made from the exploitation of their fellow human beings — have bought the influence of the Obama Administration, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton."</p>
<p>“Some call the buying of influence ‘Pay to Play’ or ‘Pay to Stay.’ In the case of the Isaias family, I call it ‘Pay to Slay,” said Operation Rescue President Troy Newman, who served as a founding board member for the Center of Medical Progress, the group that brought the illegal, but very lucrative, market in aborted baby remains to public attention last year through a series of undercover videos."</p>
<p>"According to the Orange County suit, the Isaias companies had no problem procuring on a regular basis tissue of aborted babies, including hearts, lungs, kidneys, brains, intestines, skeletal muscle and bones, from Planned Parenthood abortion facilities in Southern California."</p>
<p>"The tissue and often stem cells derived from the tissue was marked up ten times over costs, and sometimes more, creating a profitable revenue stream for the Isaias family. U.S. companies and institutions were heavily price-gouged, while foreign entities got deep discounts that still allowed for a hefty profit. The Isaias baby parts businesses shipped the remains of aborted American babies all over the world."</p>
<p>"And as if looting a bank, buying influence, illegally profiting from the sale of aborted babies, and exploiting sick third-world country patients isn’t low enough, one of the Isaias family members has sunk even lower...."</p>
<p>"Estafano Isaias, Jr., who is a co-founder of DaVinci Biosciences and DV Biologics, and is said to manage the companies’ finances, is also the CEO of Fyre TV, a web-based subscription pornography business."</p>
<p>"“This is the kind of people that can buy off Hillary Clinton,” said Newman. “It makes no difference if they are criminals, flesh peddlers, and smut dealers that are exploiting American and Ecuadorian people for profit. For Clinton, if you have enough money, anything goes. This is just another reason why her brand of corruption must not be allowed into the White House.”"</p>

        <p><p>The Ecuatorian Isaias brothers were bankers that stole all the money in their bank and then fled to USA in 2008, where they got protected from extradition by the Obama Administration after they donated a good sum of the loot to the DNC. Hillary Clinton was the person in charge to deny Ecuador the petitions of extradition.
The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/17/world/americas/ecuador-isaias-obama-campaign-robert-menendez-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0">New York Times</a> ran an article about them, it looks like they bribed several democrat senators and even worked for the Obama campaign.</p>
<p>They got again in the news because they recently got caught trafficking with baby fetuses from planned parenthood and selling their organs for profit.</p></p>

        <p><p>you guys realise that the whole "planned parenthood sells baby parts" thing is a totally, utterly confirmed hoax right? therefore anything based on it is also fake. </p>
<p>edit: this whole pizza thing originated on /pol/ </p>
<p>you realise that makes it infinitely more likely this whole thing is a gigantic ruse designed to make the people who beleive in it look retarded right?</p></p>

        <p><p>What it is confirmed by looking at your post history is that you think that Wikileaks are the russians. How about contacting the Ecuatorian embassy yourself and ask them for proof that this is an hoax? It is pretty easy to do.</p></p>

<p>I like that you're so mad about something you went through all my posts, image captured some and then made a graph about the subreddits i've been on, that's some hardcore mad right there</p></p>
