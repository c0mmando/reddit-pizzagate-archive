<strong>WTF is with this sub? Threads keep getting locked from commenting!</strong>
<p><p>How are we supposed to discuss leads and strategize when the mods keep locking threads. Kuru thread was locked after 7 comments. Protest Comet Pizza was just locked down. Seriously this is BS.</p></p>

<p><p>Here's the thing. This sub has more than doubled in 24 hours! So alot of the people coming in are not doing the basic basic research first, so they're posting something that was discovered 4, 6, 9 days ago. At the beginning everyone was well aware of sticking to the central figures THE CLINTON FOUNDATION (podesta) SOROS and TAVISTOCK. Which is what EVERYONE needs to do. Any post about a fucking random goddamn pizza somewhere, SATANTISM needs to take a back seat..people just aren't getting that now. The political, religious, satanism, cult part of it needs to stay in the background. You can see alot of SHILLS focus on garbage like that too to keep people of the main focus which is THE CLINTON FOUNDATION</p>
<p>Edit. Forgot to mention..so if the MODS are doing their job right. TONS OF FUCKING POSTS SHOULD/NEED BE DELETED</p>
<p>If people read this please please repost it everywhere as much as you can.
OTHER things to fucking avoid: Obama(seriously he isnt going to be fucking involved heavy or at all), shit about HOTDOGS, music videos, DONT SPAM/HARASS people you THINK are involved, READ THE GOD DAMN BASICS OVER AND OVER AGAIN TILL YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, THEN GO FROM THERE.</p></p>

<p><p>"CLINTONS" is too narrow in scope too, I believe. By all means the tendrils go far. If a critical mass of individuals could be indicted, THAT would do more good than just going after smaller, isolated groups with all kinds of resources to fight back.</p></p>
