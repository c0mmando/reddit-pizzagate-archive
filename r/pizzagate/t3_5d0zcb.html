        <p><p>I'm afraid that we might be too late. They are going to start nuclear war via Israel or Russia. We have martial law ready to go in the USA. It's coming. I can't tell if Trump is in on it. He doesn't seem illuminati at all, but idk if I'm wrong. </p></p>

        <p><p>I haven't slept in almost 2 days. I can't sleep. I trust wikileaks and the implications of this are that all the conspiracy theorists were basically right... former FBI director Ted Gunderson espoused this 11 years ago, except he said that it existed all the way up to the top. It means that they were right all along. These ideas aren't new, I just never believed they held water. Conspiracy of Silence is one of the only documentaries ever truly banned in the US. It addresses this directly. My mind is blown. This means the satanists illuminati conspiracy bullshit might not be bullshit.</p></p>

        <p><p>My advice would be to back away from all this, maybe even for just a day or two and think about something else for a bit, to clear your brains cache as it were. You'll burn yourself out and be no use to anyone bud.</p></p>

        <p><p>Dude.</p>
<p>These fucks might actually be doing the illuminati shit ppl been talking about for years.  </p>
<p>Mk ultra is real, documented, and connected to this shit via admittedly questionable witnesses.</p>
<p>And Trump winning just got Russia to back off threats of nuclear war.</p>
<p>If you're not a shill, you're simply a non believer.  I wish i didn't believe.  It was easier.</p>
<p>But here, saying what you're saying only encourages everyone else to ignore possible leads.  It's destructive.  And it's wrong.</p>
<p>Either dig deeper til you understand why people are saying it or go away and we'll stick our hands in the mud and filth for you.</p></p>

        <p><p>All I'm trying to do is echo what /u/Parasymphatetic said about "this will make us look crazy" as being a valid concern.</p>
<p>Anybody not completely open/already tuned into this conspiracy will shut you out when your argument is <em>"These fucks might actually be doing the illuminati shit ppl been talking about for years."</em> </p>
<p>I'm not discrediting the fact that the elite ruling class may be up to some sick stuff, but framing it as "doing the illuminati shit ppl been talkinb about for years" isn't going to attract the attention of anybody intelligent. </p>
<p>PS, FUCK CNN. </p></p>

        <p><p>If illuminati scared you so bad, what word would you suggest for a global elite conspiracy to traffic kids, control all branches of all government, control media coverage and polls, and spread disinfo in our communities?</p>
<p>I understand our disagreement.  Personally i feel like the scary name is almost necessary.  The age old conspiracies are becoming real.  Just like Snowden proving  the surveillance state crazies to be not that crazy.</p>
<p>Continuing the culture of self censorship is part of the problem.  And 4chan idiocy might be part of the solution, as insane as it looks and sounds.</p></p>

        <p><p>People hear Illuminati and tune out. Instead of saying Illuminati present solid evidence and reasoning.  People see what they want to see- unless presented with enough evidence to prove otherwise. Saying Illuminati or Satanist is what helps their confirmation bias.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah that's kind of shitty because by that definition I'm a grade A shill.  In all fairness though, if this network is a 1/4 the size we suspect it is, it makes perfect sense they would come here.  This isn't some underground, vetted coalition.  This is a group from one of the most popular web pages in the world.  The good news is all the extra eyes might bring new info and perspective.  The bad news is that makes it a potentially huge target for counter Intel</p></p>

        <p><p>Everything presented here is not worthy of upvoting or promotion. We have to self edit and vet the information that is presented. This sub is becoming very broad and unfocused and therefore less credible. Let us raise the credibility through more coherent reasoning.</p>

        <p><p>Thank you. I got into a back and forth here yesterday - urging a particular user to focus on the more concrete leads instead of googling literally any and every pizza place in the USA that the Clintons have ever eaten at and claiming that those establishments <em>MUST BE INVOLVED IN CHILD TRAFFICKING AND SATANIC PEDOPHILE RITUALS!!!</em> </p>
<p>It is that kind of childish mind state that WILL turn people off to any truth that can actually be found through all of this. </p></p>

        <p><p>This sub is filled with people who are skeptical (with good reason) of what's going on here. </p>
<p>Even if this is true you can't expect people to just come to this sub and believe everything you all are posting here. </p>
<p>A few weeks ago when the evidence was much MUCH more damning and more directly tied to the targets of your investigation you would have had a better time changing minds.  Hell, you had me believing it for a while. </p>
<p>You guys are shilling yourselves at this point.  So many flimsy leads.  So many tenuous connections.  So many pizza places that have nothing to do with this. So much borderline actionable slander.  </p>
<p>You guys have gotten way off track here.  You're exploring too many leads that most likely have nothing to do with what you were trying to prove.  And it's discredited the validity of the entire thing. </p>
<p>While you may not be able to prove that DC elites are child eating satanists, you have definitely opened my third eye to a lot of other things and for that I appreciate you.  Even if I can't swallow the kid sacrificing red pill, following this story and stories related to it has fed me a few red pills that I happily took. </p></p>

        <p><p>What makes you think the tenuous leads aren't there for exactly that reason?</p>
<p>In faceless communities, anyone can show up to dilute both the content and the conversation around it.  It's been a challenge from the start.  4chan breeds constant doubt and pushing through anyway.</p>
<p>You're not wrong about what you're saying.  It's just in progress autism.</p></p>

        <p><p>If anything there's just a lot of distractions and noise both from posters and submissions. Probably comes with the conspiracy territory on Reddit and the excitement of wanting to find new leads but really, what started off with some worthwhile and suspect pieces of related information gets diluted when random things like logos with elliptical spirals (which again isn't what the FBI pedophile symbols were anyway) get voted up with clickbait titles.</p></p>

        <p><p>No. If someone just disagrees with you they are not a shill. By definition. I still for nothing but logic and reason. Common sense. You should do the same. Those qualities should be your guides and have your allegiance before all else.</p></p>

        <p><p>Look, I applaud the goal. That's not really my point. It's just when there are posts where users are calling out the <em>Disney</em> logo for being a pedophile symbol for goodness' sake, along with things like a top-voted post saying archive.org is fully compromised when it was merely not loading a site the way they expect due to Internet Archive's known issues with archiving dynamic pages it's not exactly helpful. It would be better to phrase more like 'Important: archived page not loading, possible take-down/compromise of host? Help needed' which would be more accurate to what they experienced.</p>
<p>Nor is calling people 'shills' for no good reason helpful to this, either. If someone posts that they've found hidden files within publicly available documents for example (thanks to the work of WikiLeaks) yet doesn't include any reproducible instructions on how they've arrived at it few even question its legitimacy and upvote along with posts of exclamations. This leads to others doing the same thing. Yes, I wouldn't doubt some of this stuff <em>is</em> hidden in similar ways hence why for such a serious subject matter users could be a little more critical of information thrown this way.</p>
<p>Like it or not there are some posters who are leading others on, others with legitimately useful info, and some who are simply wanting to help even if they get a few things incorrect here and there. I'm just saying that there can be more clarity with these things.</p></p>

        <p><h4>SHILL!!! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</h4>
<p>This is the problem with doing something like this on places like reddit. </p>
<p>You get people who are excited to help. People who are not intelligent, mature or autistic enough to vet their own leads thoroughly before posting them.  It's admirable that people are so invested in this but you're absolutely right.  They've uploaded so much FUD now that it's hard to even find the worthwhile information anymore. </p>
<p>And that's not paid shills.  That's them.  Diluting their own pool of data to the point it's impossible to sift through anymore. </p></p>
