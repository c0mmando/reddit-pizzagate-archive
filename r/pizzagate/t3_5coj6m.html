        <strong>Company who Designed Comet's Ping Pong Tables: Atreusworks</strong>
        <p><p>Discovered through jimmycomet's instagram post of little girl wearing striped red and black shirt. http://archive.is/hPsLM
"mollyallendc" likes it, profile set to private. https://archive.is/3juln
However a google search reveals her site for "Custom millwork fabrication for restaurants and commercial spaces." http://www.atreusworks.com/
Confirmed that she lists "Comet Ping Pong, Washington DC - Ping pong table tops" as a client. http://www.atreusworks.com/projects/</p>
<p>http://archive.is/KpCj3
I haven't looked into any of her other clients, but there are several in the DC area.
Domain whois info reveals a "Molly Allen" has the owner. Includes her personal email for anyone who wants to investigate, also the address goes to what looks like a very shitty factory. http://archive.is/rcjsG</p></p>

        <p><p>I suspect the guy who farmed the wheat for the pizza doe to be involved as well, can somebody find the company doing this?</p></p>

        <p><p>I didn't make the claim that they are involved, however if the farm providing them their wheat is liking his little girl pictures on instagram then fuck yea we're going to look into them.</p></p>
