    Here's How They Get Children -- Satanic Temple Opening Clubs in Elementary Schools
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I could use your help in posting comments to the URL linked that show the link between satanic cults and ritual abuse of children. I just visited cultwatch.org which had some good FBI background into satanic ritual abuse.
   </p>

   </p>
   <p>
    Unfortunately, in my region the Satanic Temple now has permission to open an after-school club for
    <em>
     elementary kids
    </em>
    once a month. I called the Point Defiance Elementary School to leave a message warning them of the danger they were placing their young students in by allowing them anywhere near a satanic operation or satanists. By pointing to the link between ritual child (and infant) abuse and sacrifice, we may be able to get the public so alarmed that parents simply do not allow the club to happen in their own schools.
   </p>
   <p>
    The telephone number of the Point Defiance Elementary School is 253-571-6900.
   </p>
   <p>
    I realize this isn't directly tied to pizzagate, but such clubs and associations are exactly are kids are recruited to either participate in or be victims of satanic abuse. It only takes a minute to write a comment post on the URL, and you can simply point out the link and FBI documentation of horrific crimes committed by satanists against children and infants. Given that the area is so liberal, I would leave out any associated stuff about Podesta and the DC ring and focus instead on the general fact that Satanists have a bad history of abusing, torturing, and sacrificing kids.
   </p>

    Thanks for your time!

    satanists do not equal temple of set. There is a link to Temple of Set, which is occultist. Satanism is edgy atheism.

     If you look at the FBI link at the site I mentioned, they list dozens of cult names that are all grouped under the category of
     <strong>
      satanic.
     </strong>
     So, no, satanism is not "edgy atheism." Children who are abused by various
     <em>
      satanic
     </em>
     cults, of which there are
     <em>
      many.
     </em>

      I think we are going to get into an argument of semantics with differences between occult, satanist, wiccan, thelma, and temple or the set. You mean it in the catagorical sense, I mean it in the percise religion sense.

       I'm going by what the FBI says, and since this is about criminal investigation of child abuse and satanic abuse of children, I trust the FBI's choice of words to describe it.
