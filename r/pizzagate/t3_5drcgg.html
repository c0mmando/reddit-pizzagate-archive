        <strong>Possibly unrelated: In 2013 a diver looking for sea urchins happened upon a pile of human bones in the waters off the coast of Antibes in the French Riviera belonging to three people. A skull was present, and written on it in marker was a bullseye and the phrase "death to pedophiles."</strong>

<p>but later dismissed as some kind of DNA mistake

<p>May be a noteworthy pedo date. Just documenting...</p></p>

        <p><p>To write on a skull with a marker you'd have to clean all the meat off it... then let it be sunbleached and dry... Like I can see killing someone cause they were a pedo... but then to do all the psycho shit required to get you to the point where you could write on their skull... a bit of a stretch... then ya just dump it in the water like yer trying to hide it... why bother writing on it. I wanna see a pic of the skull, not the other bone. </p></p>

        <p><p>Well, unless they just did it for personal enjoyment. Like maybe it was a revenge killing because the person killed raped the murderer as a child. Makes sense to do those things if it was personal</p></p>
