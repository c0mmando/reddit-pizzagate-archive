        <strong>More connections between missing children/CP and pizza places.</strong>
        <p><p>Doing some digging into older cases, and right away, there are a few standouts. Can we get some investigating to see if the specific pizza places or individuals are connected to any of the known sickos? Cross-post from /r/The_Donald.</p>
