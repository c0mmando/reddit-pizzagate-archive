    There are more and more people coming to this subreddit, and as such more and more poor posts. There's a lot more stretches and attempts to somehow connect things to this that just don't work, as well as things that aren't contributing at all. But these posts are not enough to discredit this subreddit like people keep trying to do, now. It seems like we're finding a lot of stuff daily, but the problem is that we aren't trying to crack down on the really weak posts. It's nothing personal, but if a post is bad, it's a bad post. Downvoting and/or explaining that the point OP is making is not really good enough for the standard we need to create a fine line for. We aren't just a bunch of freaks.

    we can weed out the poor post by downvoting. however that 2gb hacker hoax got a lot of upvotes due to benefit of the doubt. we should vet more cautiously next time.

     It simply didn't stand on enough ground, and the illegal material sent out was shock value, potentially. This caused the uproar I presume. I never delve in unless I gain confidence, and that never struck the confidence, just curiousness.

     I called bullshit on that right in the beginning and got downvoted. This sub needs more evidence based posts and less "this guy on twitter says he's got files on Podesta" posts. I've already been called a shill for not jumping on the sensationalist bandwagon.

    The mods have been pretty quick today removing dupes, spam and posts that don't contribute anything. Maybe some are leaking through but it's on the masses to use the report button and let them know. Also they're not around 24/7 'cause everyone needs time to sleep.

     I wish we could be less paranoid but after this stuff people definitely will end up with trust issues regarding higher-ups. Too bad it ended up impacting the moderators, who seem to be legit at this point.

      The biggest problems we have right now are actual nutjobs, people that cant do a quick fact checking and /r/topmindsofreddit brigades. Every thread that gains traction has at least one user from there insulting people and the sub.

    I saw somebody get downvoted for saying magic isn't real.
