        <p><p>Is it possible for you to censor the bad illegal stuff so you can screen shot it and share it to red pill some people, or for media use?  And for proof that you reported but it isnt getting shut down?  We need exposure just as much as we need to wreck these sick fucks</p></p>

        <p><p>I called all my local news outlets here and told them about it and everything related to #twittergate. Hopefully they decide to report on it. They seemed interested, but they all said "have to talk to my producer."  So we will see. I will link if any do decide to relort on it</p></p>

        <p><p>Yea sorry.  Maybe im just retarded. Im just trying to think of a way that it can be used as evidence without implicating anybody who touches it.  Just for the record though, it is illegal even for you to just see it/look at it, let alone download/possess it.</p></p>

        <p><p>What? I looked at it hours ago when this post was first made and it was still up, I'm not being a pedo defender, because there wasn't anything illegal on that account. Please stop typing dumb things.</p></p>
