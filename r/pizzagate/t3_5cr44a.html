        <strong>SLC Daycare</strong>
        <p><p>Anyone can brief me on the connection with the old SLC Daycare posts? Is there a link with what was uncovered with that? Apparently those kids in Hampstead talking about the satanic rituals and sacrificing kids was linked back to the SLC Daycare thing...but it's really hard to find any information on how that came about. </p></p>
