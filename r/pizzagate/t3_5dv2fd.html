        <p><p>His surrogates retweeted pizzagate findings prior to the election.   Flynn did and one of his sons did.  They know.  In my opinion they were floating the idea of telling people before the election but decided to wait.  They were well ahead in their polling and were able to win without the vast majority of the country knowing the depths of "the swamp".  I think it was wise to wait; these criminals are still in power in an official capacity so the real proesecution can't begin.  No reason to pile onto the division being artificially created by propaganda when you can't move forward in court yet.</p></p>

        <p><p>I legit don't get why anybody would assassinate him. He's far more reasonable and palatable than any of the guys who would replace him. Plus, I agree, there would be severe unrest nationwide if he was assassinated.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think it would have hurt Trump. PizzaGate is far too complex to have been decoded in time to generate crowd appeal. </p>
<p>Imagine if he tried to introduce it at even at this point? The media would have crucified him as a "conspiracy theorists" which is just a license to ignore. I'm not sure what Trump's plan is, who could be sure of anything anymore right? </p>
<p>I think Trump is literally going to wait till he is in Washington then start tearing it apart. I truly believe Trump intends to drain the swamp, but that's just my opinion. I would love to find more unbiased sources on Putin. What I hear from him I love, but I can never get a source I can trust. Western sources demonize him. Putin sounds like a patriot in a good way. Like I love my country, you love your country, no wars, but let's cut the B.S. </p></p>

<p>That means he's GOOD! </p>
<p>But yeah, Putin is anti-globalist, which is why they hate him. I heard he issued an arrest warrant for George Soros. </p></p>

        <p><p>A great deal of the higher ups in Washington and Hollywood are involved in this scandal. I would be very surprised if Trump wasn't as well. He's already been accused of raping a young girl with Epstein. Why did the Clinton campaign never bring that up when they had woman after woman come forth with sexual harassment allegations against Trump? Maybe because if they brought up Epstein they'd also be implicated. </p></p>

        <p><p>Trump is not involved in this scandal.  The child rape story against Trump was made up.  He was acquaintances with Epstein, not close friends.</p>
<p>The Clintons didn't bring it up but their surrogates sure did.</p></p>

        <p><p>Wow! Thank you so much really! I haven't been able to find anything like this and the subtitles are in English! Perfect! </p>
<p>It still doesn't solve the issue of knowing a world leader's intentions and degrees of flexibility. This is almost truly impossible to know even with first hand experience, so there is nothing we can do. I do believe Putin to be a intellgent, strong, and effective leader. Russia is prime for an A.I. Revolution, and Putin has been very effective with his "Group Projects (Different governments combine under a single project). </p>
<p>Thanks again!</p></p>

        <p><p>I think you're insinuating too much. </p>
<p>1) I never said I knew the truth. I'm not claiming Trump couldn't be a plant, but I'm saying I doubt it. If Trump was in on it, then I'd expect him to have racked up some serious blackmail for them to hang over him. Obviously they didn't want each canidate to get as damaged as they did unless the real puppet master plays on a larger scale. </p>
<p>2) Trump has racked up a lot of promises in regards to "Draining the swamp" (Getting rid of current administration). Not to say they couldn't be replaced with millennial edition pedo's, but I think would think that would be a large amount of cogs to move and place. Trump has a large following that is very distrusting of the government. They know he's a billionaire, they know he knows these people, etc. If Trump betrays them, then they will betray Trump. </p>
<p>3) Listen to things Putin actually says! Especially the things he says at world events. If you don't have a historic understanding of Russia, then you probably wouldn't realize they were treated like shit many years after the end of the Cold War. Russia was a unmotivated, dying country. Putin took over in the worst circumstances in regards to economic debt being at 150% of GDP, and domestic terrorism against their country. Putin turned Russia around in 8 years, but realized he had to build a military to gain any respect at the world table. As far as Russia goes, he's a great leader. He felt like his calling was dealing with those major problems and he did. Does Russia have social problems? Yes, but people are not as motivated by them when they are pissed off all the time because they don't have enough food, heat, and being blown up etc. </p>
<p>Trump also said Word Community, not world government. There's like a billion images you can paint here. Let me paint this one...A world in which we work with each other to find beneficial solutions. A world in which we can respect that every country has its own culture, and hasn't evolved the same. Let's stop trying to propose 1# GDP first world mannerisms on countries who are not culturally/geographically/economically in the same boat. That's not to say we don't assist, or intervene, but it has to be case by case. I want to work with Russia, and China all day everyday. This is the A.I revolution and those are the top 3 countries in Data Science. Fuck the wars. Let's compete, but positively. Games we give a shit about, space races, tech races, you name it. That sounds like a fun world. </p></p>

        <p><p>I really agree with your Russia comments. I personally think that the problem is baked in, as Russia won't trust the USD, and yet we need Russia and China to be in ruins if the USD is going to survive. </p></p>

        <p><p>I agree. We still need concrete evidence. The FBI may already have it but haven't been able to do anything with it, and with the additional crowd sourced investigation perhaps the Reddit/4chan people have created an ironclad case for them. Who knows? I think we are all going to have to wait until after January 20th to see any movement on it.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well look. Nothing "uncovered" by reddit and/or 4chan could possible have "created an ironclad case for [the FBI]."  Everything I've seen on Reddit and twitter and elsewhere only leads me to the definitive conclusion that they were speaking in code.   </p>
<p>Perhaps that code is referencing underaged sex rings. It's an unfounded logical leap to assume this.  But it's not impossible — well within a realm of possibility. </p>
<p>But, nothing I've seen has definitively lead me to believe that these code words DEFINITELY refer to underage sex parties and slavery.  BUT they do convince me that something is being discussed in code.</p></p>

        <p><p>This comment by President Elect Trump, made me fucking CHEER for this man like a drunken fool. This took major balls considering he most likely knows the power of the organizations and families backing her. </p>
<p>Hillary 100% needs to be locked up or heaaaaavily investigated for her scams in Haiti. She has used haitian children as cash crops. </p>
<p><em>again not trying to "promote" my thread but this is what I have compiled on her wrongdoings in Haiti</em>

        <p><p>Exactly.  </p>
<p>All Trumps comments towards the Pig In A Pantsuit, nasty woman etc, were well planned and researched.  Going off script at this dinner was a calculated risk, he was speaking the truth.  Her reactions are priceless as he goes off script and her body language is incredibly showing her guilt at a good number of his barbs.</p>
<p>He knows she is into a lot of bad stuff, and could make those comments.  If she sued, it would bring it all to the fore front.</p>

        <p><p>yes he also pleaded the fifth regarding about 500 other questions. Heres another thing, if they know trump is after them, wouldnt they bring him down with him? we know the media lies about everything else concerning trump, tying him in to drag him down with them would be a no brainer for them. oh yea, the woman who claimed he raped her as a thirteen year old conveniately didnt show up to the deposition or court date. after that the msm claimed she didnt because of death threats for trump supporters, which is impossible because her name was jane doe on the case sheet. </p></p>

        <p><p>Epstein probably plead the 5th because he along with the other pedos try to entrap each other. To use as blackmail. And trump probably wouldn't play ball. Liked them young but legal, (indicated by his alleged crass comments to Miss Teen USA girl's, "in a few years I can date you".... Trump may have been around this stuff but there really is very thin evidence that he participated. </p></p>

        <p><p>He has called him a friend and a good guy. He said it before it became public that Epstein was a pedo. He was definitely at at least a few parties, knew of epsteins affinity for little girls. Bringing it up, opens him up to questions that would be awkward at best. </p></p>
