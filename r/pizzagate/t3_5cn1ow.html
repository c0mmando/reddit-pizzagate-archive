<p><strong>Active Cleanup Alert</strong></p>
<p>This business recently made waves in the news, which often means that people come to this page to post their views on the news.</p>
<p>While we don’t take a stand one way or the other when it comes to these news events, we do work to remove both positive and negative posts that appear to be motivated more by the news coverage itself than the reviewer’s personal consumer experience with the business.</p>
<p>As a result, your posts to this page may be removed as part of our cleanup process beginning Tuesday, November 8, 2016, but you should feel free to post your thoughts about the recent media coverage for this business on Yelp Talk at any time.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is expected. Given the gravity of the accusations, it's not uncommon for a site like Yelp to clean up.</p></p>

        <p><p>Oh I know. I was just giving a heads up in case it went unnoticed.</p></p>
