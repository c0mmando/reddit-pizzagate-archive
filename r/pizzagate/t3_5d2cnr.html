<p><p>Be careful when looking into these people... they are working for a charity so it's pretty likely they're not all bad. Just saying don't label until your 100% sure (not saying that you did, I know your just mentioning a lead) </p></p>

<p><p>what i find interesting is that there have been quite a few news stories popping up about this stuff. its almost like theyre getting us ready for the big reveal - recent FBI takedowns, JK Rowlings charity, this BBC stuff all in space of 1 or so weeks. </p></p>

<p><p>Yes,  I posted a thread the other day suggesting this,  orphanages,  foster care homes anywhere children could be passing through in a transitory way are all good leads and many large pedophile cases have come back to these kinds of establishments. </p></p>

<p><p>I heard that Jared and Sandusky BOTH liked Pizza Hut "Hawaiian" "thin crust". </p>
<p>Conicidence? </p>
<p>Ha! Doubtful. </p>
<p>We need eyes on Pizza Huts CEO and all of their drivers from the Mississippi east to DC, the Governor of Hawaii and any major "pineapple" exporters, the company that distributes the dough Pizza Hut uses and the logistics company that delivers it... NOW. </p>
<p>I'm on my way to interview both Sandusky and Jared in prison.  </p>
<p>Seriously?  The man ate fucking pizza there and they're now worthy of scrutiny? </p>
<p>You guys are losing it here... Get back on track.  If this is real you're doing a fantastic job of distracting yourselves. </p>
<p>Focus.  </p></p>
