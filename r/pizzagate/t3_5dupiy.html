<strong>CHEESE Wikileaks #50332</strong>
<p><p>Mary and John
I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been long in place. I immediately realized something was different by the shape of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy. I am awaiting the return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that we can demolish them.
Thank you so much. I hope you and your gang are well.
I miss you both
Best wishes fro a merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
Herb</p>
<h2>Ps. Do you think I'll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?</h2>

<p><p>Something which I always think is overlooked in this email is the talk of the box. It just isn't worded like a person would talk. When have you ever met anybody that discusses the shape of a box so intently before? He seems confused by the fact the box is square despite the fact boxes are generally square. It just strikes me kinda funny.</p>
<p>edit - has anyone ever looked at whether 'box' appears oddly in any other emails? It may not but it's worth a shout, his use of that word definitely isn't natural!</p></p>

<p><p>Yes I found this disturbing as well. Boxes usually ARE Square. I have not found out if box is a pedo term. </p></p>

<p><p>Maybe he's saying the stealth of the delivery was off. On the DNM, vendors use different stealth methods to conceal drugs in the mail. </p></p>

<p><p>I agree that some meaning that Herb and John both understood is escaping us.  I dug around and found a forum that discussed a practice that has been popular (hard to believe)  with prison inmates actually surgically inserting a domino under the skin in their penis to create some sort of sensation.  Ugh.  You can't unlearn these things.  </p>
<p>So, would this somehow make sense in a sick pedo world to enable a young boy to have sex? </p>
<p>This article mentions widdling down the domino to different shapes.  (No longer square/rectangle)
Could this somehow explain this bizarre exchange. </p>
<p>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214442014000205</p>
<p>"traditionally glass spheres have become dominos whittled to irregular shapes.5 In our current case, the object was a shaved down domino shaped similar to a dog bone. "</p>

<p><p>Y'all are reading too deep into it its plainer than all that</p>
<p>Pasta and sauces == money to buy drugs and source to buy drugs</p>
<p>cheese == bribe money</p>
<p>dominos == take someone down</p>
<p>Do you think he'll do better bribing to take someone down instead of getting them addicted to smack?</p></p>

<p><p>It says: "PLAYING dominos" not Dominoes pizza. Assortment of cheeses was in the box, not pizza. Nice try.</p></p>
