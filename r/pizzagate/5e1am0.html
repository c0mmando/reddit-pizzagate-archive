    Hello everyone, thank you for all the hard work up till the point.
   </p>
   <p>
    We have come to a place where we have begun to connect enough dots, but we need to bring the questions to light. With more people aware of the issues, we can ask better questions, get answers, and hopefully achieve justice.
   </p>
   <p>
    I propose we begin to use our numbers to contact the media. The world needs assistance right now, but especially the U.S. The majority of us are good people who don't support pedophilia. We've been divided to a point where we can't trust anything, and the best sources of information for this content is located on blogs, and forum boards.
   </p>
   <p>
    We need to target local news stations directly. Below I'm providing an example of how posts should go. Have a really good summary with palatable links? Do a right up like this one below. Pick 3 local news stations, grab station info, and some reporter info. Everyone needs to message these stations and ask them to take a look into this case. Do a short intro, explanation (avoid conspiracy theorist triggers). When they reply submit info packs.
   </p>
   <p>
    You also should pick a few reporters, link personal email, and twitter. Anyone in the world can openly ask these questions to these local news teams who may deal with 50 tweets a day max. Let's encourage the local stations to report this. Anyone on this thread should attempt to reach out, and if you are worried about personal twitter create a new one.
   </p>
   <p>
    I encourage everyone to do the same, and we simply upvote the data packets we like, and proceed to works as a group to contact the stations listed in the post. We can use social engineering to our advantage by applying a lot of pressure to smaller cogs. We don't want them to confirm a conspiracy, we just want them to report it. Ask questions, make us aware. Who knows who is watching?

    As you are all aware the recent controversy known as "PizzaGate" stemming out of leaked Podesta emails is surely horrifying if proven to be even remotely true. We don't know the facts, and if we assume some of the facts are true, then we can't trust the national media to report it. If this info is continually cycled on invalid sources, then it could take much longer for this to take effect.

    Pizza gate is not ready for the public. 
Only the podesta images have any validity.

     Wrong it is ready. We have all the circumstantial evidence to make this into a legitimate issue.

      It is considered an issue, police have looked into it, and news articles have been written. You don't announce your investigation or you end up like comney. 
Everyone knows that the FBI was heavily pressured too end the investigation because it interferes with the election.
CTR is in full force because they have the Arabs money, and there is newfound hope.
OP has no posts on here until this current one.

       I'm sorry what? This subreddit uses Matrix.org take a look at the collaboration tools thread somewhere on here.

       We need to get this viral so we don't get shut down as easily. Multiple subs have already been compromised. Trend statistics show that the MSM and social media platforms have decided to go nuclear on preventing #PizzaGate from trending. The goal in spreading the news is to make #PizzaGate never disappear. The more viral #PizzaGate gets the less moves MSM can make. If you want to investigate, continue investigating. Some of us should be working on making this public others should continue finding more circumstantial evidence.

        My concern was that this was being pushed while the WTP CTR troll was posting. 
The public knows about huma and podesta through spirit cooking, which is part of the satanic fear that lingers around Comet ping pong.
Local news outlets report on UFOs, its better that we have a way too convey the message that will guarantee we have control.
It would be easy for them too turn this into a conspiracy.
