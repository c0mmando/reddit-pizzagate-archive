        <p><p>All of the judges are in on it, most are pedophiles too, they've restructured the laws to get away with this. Read another story about people who raped over 42 children at their camp and the judge didn't believe any of them and essentially set a precedent where you couldn't believe children if their story was too "outrageous". </p></p>

        <p><p>Listen to yourself next time you tell a friend "They're taking kids and using pizza as code." </p>
<p>It sounds unbelievable. I told this to a friend and he expressed concern over my psychological well being.</p>
<p>Yet I am fully rational and sober and assessing the evidence rigorously. </p></p>
