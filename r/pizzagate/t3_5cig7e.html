A direct quote from the site " Come find a straight guy or girl or whatever to have fun with. "</p></p>

        <p><p>Here is there manifest from their website</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tischtennistreff (Dr. Pong) Preliminary Protocol
TABLE TENNIS AS A MODEL: 
For conversation, participation, and lesser-mitigated happiness. Interests and themes that motivate our starting are: </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Un-virtuality (physicality) / real variability. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Healthy addiction. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Losing defintion between game/sport and �partying�. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gaining control / losing control. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pre-apocalyptic activity. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvement of eye-hand coordination. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>�feedback play�. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>OTHER GAMES: 
It is intended that the game space has the possibility to itself be played, through the use of mobilized furniture, perpetually changing d�cor, installations, exhibitions, etc. It is thought that there is an appeal to walking in to a room in which one expects to be surprised. For example, the room may be rearranged as necessary in order to suit momentarily changing needs, as in a gymnasium in which sports equipment is moved and exchanged depending upon the activity at hand. </p>
<p>LOW RESOLUTION: 
The organization of the organization, as well as its space, are therefore intended to be less than comprehensively organized. It should be clear what makes up the association and its activities, but less definable in what it produces in the way of a specific atmospheric quality or public image. We, like the public at large, might at times wonder what exactly we�re dealing with here, and never know.&gt;</p>
<p>Then there is the simulacra.dk. This site is the domain of the gentlemen who is registered with the website, and is a weird 7 page blog with the second page having 'boy love' as a topic.</p></p>
