<p><p>Hi guys, I am Turkish. This is becoming huge in our country. We talk about it in our forums, we spread it among our friends. We translate this subreddit to Turkish and share it on internet.</p>

<p>I hope that our efforts help to create a public opinion.</p></p>

<p><p>Good job based Turks. This shows that all of our people in all countries want the same things, it's our governments that are turning us against each other. The people are good people, the governments are the evil ones.</p>

<p><p>fuck, i used to think that bloke who you guys hate is probably more based than Edrogan, but if hes supported by USA he was perhaps a back up if Edrogan went rogue. If he starts moving towards alliance with Russia vs ISIS then def based dictator bro.</p>
<p>doesnt that Gulen bloke have a network of dodgy charities?</p></p>

<p><p>I didn't understand bro.</p>
<p>I don't like Gülen, I don't like Erdoğan neither. Things are a bit sour between US and Erdogan because Gülenists attempted a military coup against him and Gülen is backed by US. We call him "American Imam" in Turkey!</p>
<p>And yes, this Gülen guy has a network of dodgy charities. </p></p>

<p><p>strange for them to support him whilst Edrogan seemed like an ally...
maybe Russia really did help you guys prevent it. read a story that we were the only country to send something to your intel whilst NATO stood silent. </p>
<p>a hero a died on our side but im glad that things didnt escalate into a globalist fight between us 2 countries. weve already spilled enough of each others blood over hundreds of years</p></p>

<p><p>Yes, I've heard that story too. It might be true. I am glad that the coup had failed and I am glad that things didn't escalate with Russia.</p>
<p>Probably NATO wouldn't stand with us against Russia. They don't want us in their alliance. Erdoğan is rogue and US wants someone they can control.</p></p>

<p><p>Turkey really has no reason to randomly fight Russia on its own imo. Just globalists pushing us against each other.</p>
<p>Real qs is where does Edrogan stand on Syria. It seems the main turkish priorities are preventing Kurdish state (i dont have view but i think Globalists want ethnic balkanization breakup of region so i dont support it)...but there has been lots of rumours of Edrogan profiting off Isil oil. </p>
<p>Perhaps he was in past and then post coup got pissed off? </p></p>

<p><p>There are Kurdish seperatists in my country. Their terrorist organization PKK is active since 1984, they are responsible for 50000 deaths. PKK is trying to reach Mediterranean through Syria and Turkish priority is to stop this. Because if they can reach the sea, when they establish their Kurdish state they can trade oil. </p>
<p>I don't know if Erdoğan profiting ISIS oil, it wouldn't be surprising and there have been leaks that indicates this. </p>
<p>He was US aligned but he got pissed off after coup.</p></p>

<p><p>US media is blasting someone whos supposedly their ally? def looks that coup might actually have been real.</p>
<p>infact, using Legacy Media Lesson 101:</p>
<p><em>media claim Edrogan staged fake coup to strengthen position</em>
reality ---&gt;
<em>US attempted to coup their own ally to install even bigger cuck</em> </p></p>

<p><p>Erdoğan isn't really an angel. Half of our people thinks that he is ruining the country and is a traitor. Other half would follow him to the gates of hell. </p>
<p>He is authoritarian (even a dictator on western standarts), he and his party is corrupt, he is Islamist (well, it is mild Islamism compared to other forms of Islamism in middle east...). But western media exaggarates things. It isn't like North Korea in here. </p></p>

<p><p>He isn't a victim of the media. He has been getting worse and worse for the past 15 years. Yeah he didn't stage a coup against himself but the whole thing certainly ended up as a good thing for him.</p></p>

<p><p>I have to say he isn't innocent but isn't a dictator either. Some times he could be a good person (btw i don't like him). This time twitter isn't blocked in my country so looks like he wants us to continue about pizzagate.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah, that is what I am trying to say. A lot of circumstantial evidence, but nothing that can put anyone behind bars. No photos, videos, witnesses, etc. But if we can get people aware and talking about this globally, we can start putting pressure on the right people to maybe mess up and leak something. </p></p>

<p><p>We had pedophilia scandals in the last couple of years. 45 children (5-10 yrs old) abused in a government-backed foundation's dormitory. Only one person (a teacher of this foundation, he is guilty as well) took a life sentence and probably high level bureaucrats got away with it. Government swept it under the rug.</p>
<p>So we are angry. That's why we help. We also experienced child abductions after 1999 earthquake.</p></p>

<p><p>You can see some of examples from government controlled mainstream news sites below. They have huge numbers of audience and readers. It's also covered by all largest non-controlled free outlets. </p>
<p>This got too much attention because we are really mad at child abuse allegations that has gone unpunished and suppressed in Turkey lately. We know there will be no proper prosecution until we get rid of this regime but in your country there is still hope. I believe trump is really anti establishment and take an action to stop this from happening. </p>

<p><p>Turkey has been breaking it ties with Western Countries in the last couple of years. This processes was accelerated in the last couple of months.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>negotiations about a membership with the EU are de facto dead </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>abolishment of freedom of press</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a lot of propaganda against European nations, especially Germany </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>new deal about the pipeline with Russia, although shooting doing their plane </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>podesta e-mails showed that USA threatens Turkey if they go further in this direction </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Erdogan speaking openly about renewing Turkish borders </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So I think everything that paints western countries in a bad light, is perfect for Erdogan and units his people.</p></p>

<p><p>It's kind of justification to things they swept under the rug here. Akp supporters sharing these news along with the narrative that "you guys were mad at 40 children abused here but they might be responsible for 9000 missing babies." </p>
<p>Comparing numbers and blaming States helps erdogan's west is evil agenda. That's why we see those news on state controlled media but as I mentioned before it has got too much interest in non controlled media too thanks to people translating reddit and 4Chan thus sharing this with people around. </p></p>

<p><p>Turkish people might have experienced the child abductions first hand when the Gölcük earthquake hit in 1999. There were multiple reports of children not being seen again after being led to ambulances that had no license on them. Burkha wearing women were reported to claim some kids to be "orphaned" and lead them away. There are survivors claiming that their children were rescued from the collapsed buildings, but were not seen ever again.</p>
<p>These anecdotes become a little bit relevant in our context when we find out Bill Clinton visited Turkey after the disaster, visiting survivor camps. Dig out who he traveled to Turkey with, and we may find a connection there.</p></p>

<p><p>i googled ''Missing children 1999 earthquake'' in turkish, and i think i found something, </p>
<p>http://www.haberturk.com/gundem/haber/1116426-17-agustosun-enkazinda-5-bin-840-gundur-kayiplarini-ariyorlar </p>
<p>Here is the Turkish news link and i will try to translate some highlights.</p>
<p>There is still 21 losses in Golcuk after the 17th of August earthquake, according to official numbers. One of those losses was Gözde Karamert, who was 6 years old at that time. Mother Nilgün Karamert has been intimidated by the passing of time, nor by the relatives of other lost relatives. Mother Nilgün Karamert was buried under the rubble with her husband and daughter in the houses of Golcuk Kavaklı that night. The mother, who could hear the voice of the spouse under debris from time to time, could not hear any sounds from her daughter Gözde despite all the listening.</p>
<p>At that moment, she thought her daughter was dead. She was recovered after 12 hours and her husband was recovered from the debris after 14 hours. Both were taken to the Gölcük Military Hospital. However, her daughter was not found dead or injured in the wreckage. Mother Karamert explains that they live after that day: "When my sisters were looking for us, there they said, 'We saved a husband and wife but we did not see a girl.' Our treatments continued in Istanbul. Two months later we went to the Office of crisis management .</p>
<p>They called us and said, </p>
<p>"A lieutenant has found my daughter near the wreckage, took her to the military hospital, lost her there.
" I saw the lieutenant. We showed the picture of my daughter. </p>
<p>"He was the same child." </p>
<p>He described everything from his pajamas to hair color. However, the lieutenant who led her to the hospital in her lap was fainted in the garden. Karamert, who had two children named Ayşenaz (14) and Yağız (5), said that he sued the hospital but did not get any result, saying "Gözde is now 22 years old. (6 years old around that time ) </p>
<p>"We searched a lot but we could not find it. She is grown now, a young girl , our only hope that she will come and find us. But maybe they changed his name, his surname. Maybe she's seeing us in front of her calf. Find us ".</p>
<p>--------- And another story which gives me the creeps becuse of those burka wearing women ---------</p>
<p>A woman named Şadıman Bora and her daughters Sinem and Hande (age 11 and 9) burried under the rubble and there was flooding. 
Water Current rip the girls apart from their mothers and took them away. </p>
<p>Şadıman Bora looked for her daughters in nearby towns and found piece of their clothings in a distant town.
Şadıman and her husband went to a Tent City (which was an emergency protocol back then for the survivors ) </p>
<p>And there was an Kızılay (Turkish red cross) Officer and Volunteer Teachers said;</p>
<p>"They were here, we helped them, we even draw pictures with them, but then an old woman came and claimed that they were her granddaughters and took them away." </p>
<p>They are lots of stories like that people always thought about Organ mafia and child abducters, I'm not saying this is related to Clintons i'm just saying ; Yes there are lots of missing children, but that was a disaster, those kinda things could be happened without Clintons too.</p></p>

<p><p>It was one of the quietest releases I have ever seen.  Nearly Zero websites reported on it when it happened. and they are still being sued to give more docs.</p>
<p>When they first released them they were ONLY released to a single server in D.C. and the only access to see them was you had to physically be there so Michael Best @NatSecGeek went down there everyday and photocopied as many documents as he could and put them up on the webpage...I think that lis less than 10% so far.  But the CIA gave in and all the docs are up on their own site and they are hard to search.  Wilikleaks might get them all in the future for better search.</p></p>

<p>anyway, surely if Hillary can delete emails, so can CIA? thats the issue i haev with these FOAI. surely the rely on gov being stupid enough to keep incriminating evidence? </p></p>

<p><p>...some info that may help you guess why it is popular in Turkey...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pizza commet is related to Clintons, which is also related to an islamist cult in Turkey that was related to coup attempt and many goverment ppl ( google Fethullah Gulen, Gulen movement, Gulen Hizmet , their relation with CIA and Clintons)  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All US media presented Gulens as secular islamists and in our eyes (non erdofag Turkish ppl) they were  a mafiatic cultist islamist organization lol ( you would come across them easily on your daily life ), After that i completely stopped following US media since pretty much everyone on the internet believed that they were secular normal ppl and, we evil turks who would bash erdogan every day here and there were faggots cuz we told you that they are terrible people...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>...some other reasons..</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Secular people here hate pedophilies,  and islamists loves to say look at x ppl they have pedophilies too we are not specially bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a start&amp;crescent on commet pizzas symbol and turkish flag ( star&amp;crescent heavily related with ottoman empire)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>...my personal opinion...</p>
<ul>
<li>Probably related to latest anti trump protests... </li>
</ul>
<p>... you want more that will melt your head?...</p>
<ul>
<li>9 months and 10 days before turkish coup attempt on 15 july, this video released on televisions by Gulens media zaman (related to david brock)</li>
</ul>

<p>9 months and 10 days before Turkish coup attempt , islamist cultist gulenist media channels release a video with siren sounds and a laughing baby ( 9 months and 10 days before coup attempt this is how long a baby lives in its mothers comb) and gulen means the one who laughs** laughing in turkish</p></p>

<p>Okay, hold up. You mean to tell me CTR's David Brock has his fingers up in Turkish business? </p>
<p>Wow, he gets around. Wouldn't be surprised if he were connected to Soros. Unfortunately I don't know much of anything about Gulen. There seemed to be a dearth of English info on it then. Perhaps there is more now. </p></p>

<p><blockquote>
<p>Gulen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gülen leads an islamic cult which sought political power in Turkey with the help of AKP. Exam questions for certain positions like police, teachers etc. were handed beforehand to Gülenists, and important positions were infiltrated by Gülenists.</p>
<p>These members would give a certain share of income to the organization and grow together.</p>
<p>Positions in the justice system, in the supreme court were also infiltrated by Gülenists, and trials against Kemalist military officers begun with allegations that they were going to overthrow the government with a coup.</p>
<p>Those officers were jailed, and guess who replaced them? Exactly Gülenists. And after a power struggle between Gülen and Tayyip, Tayyip started to call them first 'parallel state' and later 'terrorist organization'.</p>
<p>And the Gülenists who infiltrated the military performed a failed coup d'etat on July 15th. </p>
<p>Gülen lives in Pennsylvania and has heavy ties with the Clinton family. </p>
<p>The Gülenists lost pretty much any control of Turkey right now, and the coup seemed to be their last chance. </p></p>

<p><p>Thank you for taking the time to write this. Some of what you've said, I've read from other sources. </p>
<p>Is gulen the head of an Islamic cult or an Islamist group? Are there any credible sources I can read from that covers the beliefs and practices of this group? </p>
<p>Just so I can go on my merry way without derailing the conversation. </p></p>

<p><p>Probably you can't read groups belief but as a student who had a teacher on gulens side i could say they call young people to organizations like eating (they call it pilavli) etc. They are educating them and making islamic people who doesn't watch tv and even doesn't use phone because of they aren't made by islamic people. After this coup thing he got kicked from school so i don't know what gulen and his people doing right now.</p></p>

<p><p>im guessing with Gulen Turkey would have led a much more aggressive anti Russian/Syria Foreign policy. makes sense. Would be key ally. Now Turkey might help Russia/ stay neutral (not that it makes diff cos we be USA allies now)</p></p>

<p><p>Go Turkey! im glad we Russians didn't start war with you. now we see where real evil sits. just a thought from Russian point of view. we always thought that westers liberal governments are a kind of sect. After Crimea crisis, all of them showed such level of solidarity at imposing sanctions on us that we feel is abnormal. so what these sanctions are meant to do? to make those unprotected poor people with little money even more poor than they are in hope they will overthrow government. this is facking satanic plot. Now they r about to put sanctions on Turkey, nice.</p></p>

<p><p>we have historical differences but thats because leaders fought for their nations interests over hundreds of years.</p>
<p>to even think about the idea of us butchering each other for the profit of Soros, Clinton etc? fuck them. Alliances formed in the most weirdest of places.</p>
<p>Russia banned adoption of kids from USA for this reason. </p>
<p>Our love for our children will unite us </p></p>

<p><p>I suspect that Soros, or Israel or whoever is organizing that child sex ring (and other shit), because they want to have as many people in their hands as possible, because that allows for enormous power without people realizing you have the power.</p>
<p>Clinton is probably involved in pedophilia, and therefore in "their" (whoevers) hands, that's why they pushed her. Trump probably isn't involved, that's why they hate him. The media and politicians are probably mostly mostly involved in some shit too.</p>
<p>It's entirely possible that some person or group blackmailed american presidents for the last few decades at least.</p>
<p>If all this shit proves to be right, we really need a remake of house of cards...</p></p>

<p><p>I truly hate Trump. He is bigoted and an artifact of an older age. With that said, I truly love Trump. If the media really went against him because he isn't in this giant pedophilia ring of satanism, he is the hero we need. I can accept his flaws easily if he can purge the CIA and the uber elite. </p></p>

<p><p>I don't dislike Trump at all, but I can totally live with that opinion of yours.</p>
<p>However, it's upon us to do part of the hero-work too. If it was only Trump, they would simply assassinate him (which is still a likely occurrence, they didn't artificially create the mood where people expect an assassination for nothing).</p>
<p>If this conspiracy theory holds true, this might as well be the biggest scandal in all of human history, even if all other conspiracy theories were also true. 9/11 an inside job? Moon landing fake? Peanuts.</p></p>

<p><p>I just hope that Trump doesn't get assassinated, as long as he is clean. He needs to end this corporate state. It will be a supreme irony if he, the corporate symbol, ends it in 8 years. Inshallah, with Godspeed ;D </p></p>

<p><p>Imagine how clueless normal people would look at their newspapers in confusion, as it writes that the last 5 or so US presidents, a big chunk of the media people, much of the EU and European elite and many celebs are involved in a giant child-rape-sadism-satanism-murder-canibalism-torture-ring and that they have been imprisoned.</p>
<p>They'd probably think it's a giant hoax, an april joke or something.</p></p>

<p><p>Also, something just hit my mind. Did anyone here watch Tim Burtons movie "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"?
In short, it is about how an owner of Barber shop lured people in his barber shop, then killed them, thrown their bodies in a secret backroom and his coleague made food of them in her little restaurant. i always thought that this movie was very strange and out of place, because Tims movies are generally kind and easy, while this one was barely watchable. What if he knew something ? Demons barber shop+restaurant = Pizza+Ping pong
this movie also dealed with political themes</p></p>

<p><p>We're with you guys. In a religious institution called the Ensar Foundation we have experienced a similar resemblance to these events. It's like a Spotlight movie, but nobody could go on top of it. We could only demonstrate our reaction by protesting this foundation and its sponsors. I hope you guys will find the responsibility by not forgetting this.</p>

<p><p>I'm really curious about Turkish people, in specific. I'm from Turkey myself, our news channels report pedophilia news almost every once in a week, yet no one makes a noise about it. When it comes to America, Turkish people losing their shit. Does that count as hypocrisy?</p></p>

<p><p>We have an obligation to bring down this ring. If we can use the power of collective internet resource-pooling and meme-spicing to put a man into the White House against all odds, we can EASILY do the same to bring down a pedophile ring ran by idiots who have no concept of online security protocol.</p></p>

<p><p>i think one of the reasons why it's becoming huge is it's claimed that gulen donated to hillary foundation and you know what people think about him after the coup attempt. </p>
<p>Idk if this even gets attention in the usa but i'm expecting to hear more about all claims. </p></p>

<p><p>This is  my first time  on Reddit and the reason for this is, it really is the pizza gate is spreading so so  fast here in Turkey  now especially on Twitter,facebook  etc but most importantly on the website called eksisozluk.com (similar to reddin in some ways,mostly it is like an online based dictionary where people write their own definitions of things). One of the authors translated most of the stuff written here and posted it and now although it is 3 am  here, people are reading and commenting. I am  also  doing some translations so Turkish speakers can fully  understand what s going on. I am  sick to my stomach...I cant even go to  sleep.</p></p>

<p><p>It's not related to earthquake. People keep searching news about missing children after eaethquake and Clintons visit but It's a different story. Couple of months ago a teacher in government owned charity, ensar, was accused of abuse of 45 children. Every week we hear another child molestation story from these charity owned schools. You can see details below. </p>

<p><p>It's so funny that when someone in any topic, in any comment, in any way types "Turkey", there goes along an Armenian genocide mention. Aren't you tired already? People talking about a strange possible deep government cult with thousands of worldwide child lost in human traffic and pedophilia (even cannibalism); but someone has to mention Armenian genocide claim. 
Get over yourselves. Sex slave children and catching cannibal occult members are way more important than your so-called history. For once be a human on earth other than a race-lover fascist!</p></p>

<p><p>I'm outtatheloop here, is this subreddit satire or what? </p>
<p>I clicked on the original the_donald post but they deleted the photo. 
Is it the photo of the two Korean journalists and their daughter eating a pizza where they make wild accusations about Clintons and child trafficking based on that alone?</p>

<p><p>Let me see if I can find you a good summary my dude. But it's not a joke.</p>
<p>There are very serious and very heavy implications of a world wide child trafficking ring, but on top of that pizzagate particularly pertains to the likely possibility of a pedophile ring (people who abuse and pass around children for their own pleasure) working within our (the USA's) own government. </p>
<p>Sorry I'm on mobile but here's a good (albeit kind of hard to digest) summary for you. Trust me, the weird, disgusted, existential feelings go away after about a week.</p>

<p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>  Type in ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ for proper formatting</p>
<p>Actual reply:</p>
<p>For the </p>
<pre><code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯
</code></pre>
<p>like you were trying for you need three backslashes, so it should look like this when you type it out</p>
<pre><code>¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
</code></pre>
<p>which will turn out like this</p>
<p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>
<p>The reason for this is that the underscore character (this one _ ) is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does (this guy * ).  Since the "face" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the "face" (this guy (ツ) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first "\_" is just saying "hey, I don't want to italicize (ツ)" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol</p>
<p><strong><em>CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.</em></strong></p>
<p>Edit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type _italicize_ or *italicize* in order to get <em>italicize</em>.  Since we put an escape character we have \_italicize_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You <strong><em>would</em></strong> need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.</p></p>
