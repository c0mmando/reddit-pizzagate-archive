<strong>Papa Kills Babies. Has this been reviewed in conjunction with all other information. Seems there may be some leads or connections here.</strong>
<p><p>I do not know if this video has been reviewed or considered as piece to the puzzle. It's bizarre in it's own right, sickening to be honest, but wanted to bring it to light because I noticed some similarities with other information we've been discussing.</p>
<p>At about :45 the children mention shopkeepers, McDonalds, and what sounded like "pizza inspections".</p>
<p>The video in question can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7_epvNbaPQ
Mirror: https://vid.me/pJxP</p>
<p>I archived additional information related to it here:</p>
<p>https://web.archive.org/web/20161112004833/http://aanirfan.blogspot.com/2015/02/satanic-child-abuse-in-hampstead.html</p>
<p>The following site claims it's false. That the mother tortured her children in creating the story.</p>
<p>http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ricky-dearman-dad-falsely-accused-5553483</p>
<p>Please direct me to more information if it's been uncovered. If not, please review to see if any of it connects to some of the work you all have been doing.</p></p>

<p><p>well that's fucked up.</p>
<p>But if this Pizza thing has any merit, it is pointing to something similar.</p>
<p>Even if the mum made it up, which is possible... where the hell did she get the story from? Seems like a weird and oddly specific thing to make up</p></p>

<p><p>No way this is made up. I have two kids. They never lie this well.</p>
<p>Look at the girls face at -30 left on the video. This scares the shit out of me.</p></p>

<p><p>well if you read into it, it's suggested the mum harmed the kids in order to tell this story</p>
<p>and said mum has fled and hasn't been seen since...so...not exactly the actions of an innocent person.</p>
<p>Guess we will never know. But yeah, the outcome of the case was that the mom told the kids to tell this story... but, it's so detailed and such, it could be true.</p></p>

<p><p>I dunno. Trying not to put that tinfoil hat on, but couldn't they have made mum the scapegoat and made her disappear? Seems like an easy fix for the elite with near unlimited sums of money</p></p>

<p><p>well if i was to wear my tin foil hat nice and firm, I would say, once the court turned it on her and dismissed the claims. She realized there was no way to convince anyone, since it went to the top anyway.</p>
<p>So she had to vanish to protect herself.</p></p>

<p><p>There was a 2 hour video going around of this girls therapy sessions. I watched the entire thing and after it was over I just wasn't really sure what to make of the entire thing. She admits at one point that her mom's boyfriend made her lie about the killing babies part, but she said that everything else was true. But the amount of detail she went into makes me think that the entire story could have been true.  Regardless, there is no doubt this girl has been some serious abuse and trauma.</p>
<p>The whole thing is very sad and very bizarre. Last I heard the mom and boyfriend are still missing.  </p></p>
