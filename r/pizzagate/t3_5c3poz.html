<p><p>I'm not 100% sure I buy David Shurter's story. Heard him on Ground Zero Radio the other day.</p>
<p>Is it really true or just something sensational to hold onto? When the pitch is 'buy my book' I have a hard time following after that.</p></p>

<p><p>I have David Shurter as a Facebook friend, he seems to hold on to a lot of anger and it makes it hard to listen to him. And i agree, pitching to buy their book is a huge pet peeve of mine lol</p></p>

<p><p>Thanks for that. I looked at his book on Amazon. Most of the reviews were overwhelmingly positive, but the negative reviews seemed to indicate that the book was an absolute mess.</p>
<p>David claims his brother was a photographer for the pedophile ring and was killed or died. Any truth to that?</p></p>
