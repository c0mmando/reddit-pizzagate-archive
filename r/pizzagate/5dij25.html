    Lets just pretend for a moment that there's no pedophile aspect here. Isn't it odd just how much the people we are discussing are involved in so many child charities? I'm sure there's legitimate aspects, maybe some altruism here and there but every single person, especially connected with the Clinton Foundation has dozens of charities attached to them. Some have run programs/departments involving them. There's got to be at least some kind of money laundering scheme going on here, no? Just seems way too convenient. The pizza places and the charities seem like fronts for this. That's a crime in itself. I mean, if people don't believe there's pedophillia going on here, doesn't it still overall smell fishy? Like something shady is going on?

    Could be pedophilia, could be drugs, could be money laundering. Pedo is just the one with the strongest evidence (use of known pedo code words.)

    I recently watched "The Clinton Chronicles". It seems like slick willy got his start (with the Mena Coke run) by creating a State Agency that provided funding to schools, libraries etc. It was called ADFA. It got money from State coffers and gave loans (ostensibly) for construction etc... Issue was who the loans went to, how much the loans were for and the fact they were never repaid anything close to in full.
   </p>
   <p>
    It's where he cut his teeth on fleecing State or Federal Treasuries, by giving money to Charities, Foundations he was involved in, friend's construction companies and so on.
   </p>
   <p>
    When he got into office, he had so many people on the hook for unpaid loans, dark transactions (all the while he was involving State and Federal Employees in his sexual addictions, plus, people were afraid of him because they knew resistence could kill) that he could put those people into Judicial positions and Law enforcement positions to smother any possibility of exposure and the monster just got bigger.

    Enter Hillary (who has
    <em>
     ALWAYS
    </em>
    worn the pants in the family) She appears to have always been the true mastermind behind his
    <em>
     psychopathic
    </em>
    crime empire. She comes on the scene and uses the Department of State to launder IMMENSE sums from the Saud family and the royal Qatar family - etc.

    Influence, Weapons, Drugs and Children. By far the most lucrative commodities on Earth.

   <p>
    That's what we're trying to uncover here. The satanism is probably the lifeblood but RICO and Sadistic Pedophilia are the crimes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Be aware, the Clinton Foundation is only one of possibly thousands of Foundations that are moving
    <em>
     vast
    </em>
    sums around in exchange for influence or control.

    In order to hide money from real crimes, you need to commit financial crimes.

    Probably this is the case. The situation is corruption, not pedophilia. Corruption is also crime, but not as sick as pedophilia. However the people accused cannot say "We are not pedophiles, we are just corrupt politicians." Therefore they try to cover this up. On the other hand, their oppenents try to show this as pedophilia because it is much more disgusting.

     If you are unwilling to plea your innocence after evidence is pointing to you as being a pedophile, then you better be ready to get the label of being a pedophile. Regardless of the circumstances.
