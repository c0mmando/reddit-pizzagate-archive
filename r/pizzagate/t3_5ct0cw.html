<strong>How the media will approach this story if and when they get around to covering it</strong>
<p><p>TLDR; Alt-right conspiracy nuts harass Jews, gays, artists.   </p>
<p>There are Jews (and non-Jews) involved in this.   J. Epstein is probably Mossad.   Unfortunately tribalism is instinctive, and Jews are heavily involved in the media.   We will see such tribalism at play if and when the story breaks (note that the reference to Marina Abramovic's Jewish heritage was deleted from her Wiki entry when the Spirit cooking story broke).     </p>
<p>There are gays involved in this.   Gays and lesbians can be pedophiles just like straight people.   Everyone should check out the documentary "An Open Secret."   It shows a pattern of gay pedophiles like Bryan Singer essentially using their homosexuality as a shield.   If it were revealed that some powerful director was throwing pool parties overflowing with naked twelve year old girls I can't imagine the story being swept under the rug.   This may relate to gynocentrism ie the tendency for human beings to be more concerned about the well being of females than males.  </p>
<p>There are artists involved in this.   In fact the art world appears to be inextricably linked to these networks (see Tony Podesta etc.).   It is no secret that art is used to launder money for criminal activities.   Evidently that includes child trafficking and child pornography.   </p>
<p>Two mainstream media articles have so far appeared about Pizza Gate.   One (local DC paper) referred to "crazy alt-right Trump supporters" who were "obsessed" with a "Satanic cult" pizza shop.   Needless to say most readers will laugh rather than investigate further.  </p>
<p>The second article was in Huffington Post.   It described "idiotic" Trump supporters "mistaking" the great "performance artist" Marina Abramovic for a Satanist.    Nevermind that this woman's art basically consists of Satanic rituals.   I mean there are pictures of her posing with a severed goat's head for Christ's sake. </p>
<p>The occult and "Satanist" angle will be stressed.   Satanic rituals are so far removed from the average person's experience that they will brush it off as crazy talk.   This may be one of the reasons elites engage in these ceremonies -- to traumatize the kids and to ensure that they sound nuts if they ever come forward.   On the other hand, some of these creeps are presumably honest-to-goodness Satanists.   Occult rituals may also be a means of bonding and creating an in-group, like Skull and Bones or Bohemian Grove.    </p>
<p>The food-references will be stressed.   Though they are undoubtedly curious, even bizarre, they could still be written off as code for something more mundane, such as drugs.   It's even possible that the food references mostly describe actual food and dinner parties, and that the exposure of Comet Ping pong was a lucky coincidence (I wouldn't agree).    </p>
<p>References to the "Satanic Panic" will be numerous.   McMartin Preschool will be cited.   Liberals who consider themselves progressive and supportive of artists and homosexuals and people who practice Wicca etc. will rally behind the beleaguered pizza chain.   </p>
<p>What they probably won't do: they won't link to an archive of Jimmy Comet's instagram.   The countless pictures of toddlers and babies accompanied by horrifying sexual innuendo ("Chickenlovers, "Baby...yum!"..."Gay baby!" etc) are highly intuitive.   Perhaps this is why they haven't yet covered the story.  </p>
<p>Other things they probably won't do: they won't cite Jeffrey Epstein and his black book; they won't talk about the well documented history of these rings; they won't talk about Tony Podesta's sick artwork and his relationship with Dennis Hastert; they won't cite the pool party email describing kids as "entertainment"; they won't talk about the creepy "babysitter"/"toddler massage" guy; they won't talk about that fifteen year old girl photographed with Bill Clinton (she appears to have become a procurer); etc. etc.  </p>
<p>This story may actually be very difficult to spin.   We don't have any hard evidence yet but we have a very large and growing amount of circumstantial evidence.   There's even a wiki being created.   Perhaps the media won't cover it at all.   The biggest obstacle here is the naivete of the average person.   As Marshall McCluhan wrote, "Only the small secrets need to be protected.  The big ones are kept secret by public incredulity."     </p></p>

<p><p>Another angle they may take is more aggressive: "dangerous and irresponsible internet detectives," "why the internet is too powerful for the common people," "the 1st amendment is outdated."</p></p>

<p><p>THIS is how we do it. The Mainstream Media tried their absolute hardest to get Killary elected. Donald Trump won a lot of people over through social media, including his Twitter, and The_Donald. Mainstream media will bury this, but people can spread it through online forums, blogs, their own websites, Reddit, Twitter, etc.  </p>
<p>We will not let this go. It is getting some coverage in smaller publications already. It is trending on Google. We just have to keep pushing forward, until MSM is forced to report about this, and the people DEMAND justice to be served. The fact that it appears the major LEO are not only apathetic to take action, but that there is a lot of evidence to suggest that they are actively involved in this pedo ring obviously makes this an enormous task. However, it can and will be done.  </p>
<p>Keep digging. Keep spreading awareness. I have already managed to red pill a few people in my life. </p></p>

<p><p>We could stress the fact that Trump is a possible suspect. They love a good anti-Trump story.</p></p>
