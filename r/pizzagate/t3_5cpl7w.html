<p><p>Actually, Comet Ping Pong's website and wiki page is very open about the existence of a back room for gigs and live events. This is nothing more than a poster for a music event. </p></p>

<p><p>That doesn't necessarily mean that this specific music event isn't for all ages. </p>
<p>Don't antagonise me. I'm playing devil's advocate. We need to make sure that what we share as "evidence" is watertight. </p></p>

<p><p>The "All Ages" (shiver) hand signal is a known satanic/illuminati gesture.  Means 666.</p></p>

<p><p>It's also a universal symbol for "OK", as in it's ok for people of all ages to attend the show.</p></p>

<p><p>Of course, but that's how things like secret gestures stay secret; you co-opt otherwise innocuous hand signals that can have other meaning in different contexts.  They could have very easily just used a "Thumbs up" here, or no hands at all.</p>
<p>I'd say that in this context it is at least... interesting.  The whole reason everyone is looking at this poster is because of the theory that it is involved in child trafficking and satanic ritual... hand here we see:</p>
<p>Fist full of money ---&gt; Location of Place on globe ---&gt; 666 hand signal with "All Ages"</p></p>
