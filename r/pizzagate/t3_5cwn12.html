        <p><p>I think that's it. If you're underage and can't get a tattoo, you try shitty homemade tattoos. This looks like the masonic symbol, but in stick figure form. I had a friend who did the same thing, but with a cross. </p></p>

        <p><p>I've followed both pizzaboyz and pouros_walker on IG for a while now. Pizza boyz because I like pizza and find it interesting that they have somehow made a business off of the selling little pins and just smoking weed all the time and porous because his art is kind of nuts, found him from some trump art. Neither of these are anything to get riled up about. Stay on track.</p></p>

        <p><p>Nice find.  That does seem a bit weird.  Like why would they add that on top of the roof? It must of been intentional.  I wonder if that is pedo/sex symbolism.</p></p>

        <p><p>I mean, if this were some bar or night club I wouldn't question it....but this is a "kids" place and they just have SO much stuff that is sexualized. From the art (in the pizzaria, not the guys house), to the people they have on friends in their site, to the people who perform, and all the way down to the things they post/follow on social media. It just doesn't add up.</p>
<p>It would be one thing if they said "kids welcome" I suppose....but they ADVERTISE it AS a children's place...ya know? Just weird. Not saying it is proof, but still strange.</p></p>

<p>In this context, everything fucking adds up, every single thing we notice has so much sense, the more I read about the more connection I find and the more frightened I get from this fucking weird situation.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well, I can tell you one thing: this kind of "advertising" definitely isn't going to sell pizza to anybody.  Nobody's going to see that and think, "hey honey, I was just thinking about female genitalia, the Illuminati, and our dark lord Lucifer, so I'm wondering, do you want veggie or supreme?"</p></p>

        <p><p>Great find. 
It's disturbing how blatant and public this is.
Definitely zero remorse involved.</p>
<p>also :
People keep saying we need a whistleblower. Jared has lost everything already, maybe he'll snitch.</p>

        <p><p>Can't verify, but there is FB profile with the same name of a Syrian.  There are no public pics of him there but there is a pic of his deceased brother.  Looks very similar to LinkedIn profile pic of a guy that works at Coast One Financial Group in San Diego.  Btw...Coast One is an alleged IRS assistance fraud company.</p></p>

        <p><p>I got a message from Yelp saying they had removed my review of Comet Ping Pong. </p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We're writing because you recently posted a review of Comet Ping Pong. We understand this business recently received media attention, and that people feel inclined to post their reactions on the business's Yelp page. The best place to share your thoughts, however, is on Yelp Talk (http://yelp.com/talk). Ultimately, we remove reviews that appear to be motivated more by news coverage rather than one's own customer experience with the business. With that said, we've removed your review, and encourage you to visit Yelp Talk to share your comments.</p>
<p>We apply this same policy regardless of the business and regardless of the topic at issue in order to avoid injecting our own varied viewpoints into the debate. You can read more in our Support Center: http://www.yelp-support.com/article/What-does-Yelp-do-when-a-local-business-becomes-the-focus-of-widespread-media-attention</p>
<p>Thanks for understanding, and we'll see you on Yelp!</p>
<p>Regards,
The Yelp Support Team
San Francisco, California</p>
<p>Yelp Support Center | http://www.yelp-support.com
Yelp Official Blog | https://www.yelpblog.com
Yelp for Business Owners | https://biz.yelp.com</p>
<p>I sent an email telling them I'd share this on social media as obviously Yelp is complicit in the abuse and part of the cover up. </p></p>

        <p><p>To be fair yelp is indeed a place for you as a customer to post your sincere remarks.  Assuming you did not go there and are not posting a customer review you should not be posting on yelp. They did the right thing I don't see what you want to get out of this as you're painting them in the wrong which they're not.</p></p>

        <p><p>So are you saying that showing pictures of child abuse on the Comet Ping Pong owner's instagram does no wrong? We have many instances of child abuse and child trafficking already. Why are you defending them? </p></p>

        <p><p>Yelp is a horrible company; many business owners have complained about them. Don't trust them - they were probably paid by Comet to remove anything negative. </p></p>

        <p><p>Could very well be true. Yelp is known for making businesses pay for good reviews to stay and to put poor ratings further down or even delete them. If you google info on Yelp you can find a lot of small business owners that have gotten screwed by them. </p>
<p>Though in this case I can't really blame Yelp for removing reviews that seem fake...then again comet ping pong probably has plenty enough money to pay Yelp for whatever they demand so who's to say this is say Yelp is doing it for fair treatment or because they had Comet pay up :/ </p></p>

        <p><p>this is clearly a joke/art account. they're not the ones to blame. comet ping pong tagging someone is very strange though. if its a place aimed at families representing things like this wouldn't be the smartest move. </p></p>

        <p><p>Other than cometpingpong's involvement in the one image I don't think there are anything wrong with pizzaboyzzz posts. Some people are saying this is more "proof" but I don't see it. </p>
<p>Sure the owner of this pizza shop may have some questionable religious beliefs but that doesn't make them bad. Some people just like different art styles and don't like christianity.</p></p>

        <p><p>Shit comment.  Add some value by explaining yourself instead of insulting.  You provide nothing useful to the investigation with comments like that.  I have contributed a lot of good stuff on this sub reddit and barely slept the past few days.  This is a good find if you know anything about @joshuaryanv instagram photos.</p></p>
