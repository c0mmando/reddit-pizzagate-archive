    I FOUND SOMETHING! AUTISTS! THE WEB IS REVEALING ITSELF!
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    A nimble navigator found a link between Alefantis and one Izette Folger. Folger turns out to be on the Advisory Board of a charity called Innocents at Risk.
   </p>
   <p>
    https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cpwdq/james_alefantis_is_friends_with_izette_folger_who/
   </p>
   <p>
    Thank you, u/1337b01.
   </p>
   <p>
    I dug a little deeper.
   </p>
   <p>
    More evidence James Alefantis and Izette Folger are close:
James Alefantis is the Board President of Transformer, a DC-based non-profit that supports artists.
One of those artists is Izette Folger.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.transformerdc.org/about/council
   </p>
   <p>
    We could assume that Folger gets funding from Transformer? Maybe this money is given in return for something. Follow the money...
   </p>
   <p>
    Transformer needs to be dug the fuck up.
   </p>
   <p>
    (It seems legitimate, but there are a few pictures within their PR video that look a little shady. At 1:07 - white masks, read capes. A decapitated toy bunny at 1:08. "Aids: Made in USA" at 1:18. B&amp;W drawings at 1:22. Maybe it's all just "art" and I'm reading into it too much...)
   </p>
   <p>
    More evidence that Izette Folger is an artist:
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.caroljoynt.com/my-blog/washington/ (Search 'Folger')
   </p>
   <p>
    Folger is also part of The Ladies Who Lunch. She hosted the ladies for an evening.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/across-the-nationacross-the-world/2015/washington-social-diary-the-ladies-who-lunch
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm not sure what to make of the description of her, but these two read as potentially euphemistic:
   </p>
   <p>
    "not fitting any old mold, making her own, and breaking it"
"a party animal who can outlast her friends, the master of her own unique look, the leader of her own pack."
   </p>
   <p>
    Her LinkedIn looks like it has been deleted. I don't know how recently or if it's definitely hers:
   </p>
   <p>
    https://www.linkedin.com/in/izette-folger-93b43141
   </p>
   <p>
    Folger was at the ELLE and Hugo Boss Women in Washington Power List Dinner at the Kreeger Museum on March 16, 2016 in Washington, D.C. There are photos of her with many interesting and high-powered people.
   </p>
   <p>
    The very first one I looked into was Skye Raiser.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.zimbio.com/photos/Izette+Folger/ELLE+Hugo+Boss+Women+Washington+Power+List/RT9-j2ZXNQQ
   </p>
   <p>
    She is the daughter of Bill Clinton's Chief of Protocol, Molly Raiser.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.jewishworldreview.com/1103/grove103003.asp
   </p>
   <p>
    So from some simple Googling, I have found another link between Alefantis and the Clinton campaign. I wish I could delve into this further, but I can't. Maybe I'll get the chance later. Would love to get some eyes on this! Looks fishy!
   </p>
   <p>
    Who else could she be meeting at these events? And at the Ladies Who Lunch? It seems like endless reach.
   </p>
   <p>
    Stay frosty, pedes.
   </p>
   <p>
    EDIT:
   </p>
   <p>
    Pizza reference from Folger, when talking about fellow DC artist Philippa Hughes. Coincidence?
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/news/article/13039725/the-philippa-hughes-collection (Search 'pizza')
   </p>
   <p>
    Look at Hughes' website. She set up the Pink Line Project (innuendo?), and is described as a provocateur. Some quotes on her could be interpreted as sketchy. She is a board member of many different organizations, and is a contributor for HuffPo.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://philippahughes.com/
   </p>
   <p>
    A blog post from a month ago, in which Hughes says, along with anti-Trump rhetoric:
"Maybe because a man grabbed my pussy when I was 10-years-old at a party in my own home. Or because another man grabbed my budding nipples when puberty hit and said my new breasts looked like mosquito bites. Or because a college teaching assistant offered to give me an A in his class if I had sex with him. Or because a man offered me money for sex when I worked as a waitress in a bar."
   </p>
   <p>
    http://philippahughes.com/2016/10/notokay/
   </p>
   <p>
    ANOTHER CONNECTION:
   </p>
   <p>
    At the bottom of the page of Hughes' Pink Line Projects is a video of the National Cherry Blossom festival.
   </p>

   <p>
    Recognize anyone at 1:29?
   </p>
   <p>
    Heavy Breathing:

   </p>
   <p>
    WOW:
   </p>
   <p>
    "Our Values:
Courage. Act according to what is true and authentic for you rather than what anyone expects of you.
Curiosity. Combat intellectual stagnation with curiosity about everything and by exploring everywhere.
Passion. Suck the marrow out of life and wake up every morning screaming at the top of your lungs."
   </p>
   <p>
    EDIT 2:
   </p>
   <p>
    I went back to Izette Folger and saw her acquainted with a woman named Ludmilla Cafritz.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/iiIcX
   </p>
   <p>
    I found this photo of Ludmila Cafritz with a child.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/XnW2T
   </p>
   <p>
    I found this photo of Ludmila Cafritz with her husband, Conrad Cafritz.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/ZLZ8D
   </p>
   <p>
    Conrad Cafritz is the son of mogul real estate developer, Morris Cafritz.
According to Wikipedia, the Morris and Gwendelyn Cafritz Foundation with $735 million in assets, and who donate $20 million per year.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/XmbzN
   </p>
   <p>
    That's a hell of a lot of money.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here is a list of where the Morris and Gwendelyn Cafritz Foundation recently donated to:
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/vppoh
   </p>
   <p>
    It includes a $40,000 donation to Homeless Children's Playtime Project. There are at least a hundred donations to different projects.
   </p>
   <p>
    DO ANY OF THEM LOOK DODGY???
   </p>
   <p>
    Yes! Keep Reading!
   </p>
   <p>
    ALSO:
   </p>
   <p>
    Tony Podesta and his wife are donors to Transformer, the arts foundation of which Alefantis is the Board President, and of which Izette Folger was an artist.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thanks, u/Tinuv
   </p>
   <p>
    So, to summarize:
   </p>
   <p>
    Tony Podesta donates to a non-profit, Transformer, of which James Alefantis is the Board Manager.
An artist and board director for Transformer was seen socializing in DC with Ludmila Cafritz. She is married into the Cafritz family.
This family's foundation supposedly donates $735 million per year to over a hundred charities.
There are at least two children's charities.
   </p>
   <p>
    YUGE
   </p>
   <p>
    EDIT 3:
   </p>
   <p>
    Ludmila Cafritz and Izette Folger did not just meet in 2016.
   </p>
   <p>
    Evidence of them together in 2006, with Conrad Cafritz.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/QJgpn
   </p>
   <p>
    Evidence of them being at the same party in 2009.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/HUZYK
   </p>
   <p>
    Evidence of them together in 2016.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/iiIcX
   </p>
   <p>
    It looks as if they've known each other for at least 10 years.
   </p>
   <p>
    EDIT 4:
   </p>
   <p>
    MORE ON SKYE RAISER:
   </p>
   <p>
    She is a photographer, and has book with pictures of young children.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/9wAw6 http://archive.is/EvHNy
   </p>
   <p>
    Skye Raiser with Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, 2006.
   </p>
   <p>

   </p>
   <p>
    Skye Raiser photographed with David Dorros, the Vice Chairman of CBRE Capital Markets National Loan Sale Advisory Group.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/GOst0
   </p>
   <p>
    Skye Raiser is mentioned in several annual Washington Social Lists in connection with David Perlin.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/9UgsT http://archive.is/kQ2jf
   </p>
   <p>
    Skye Raiser photographed with David Perlin.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/7NaYp
   </p>
   <p>
    Perlin is a Private Wealth Advisor for Goldman Sachs.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/9lZIw
   </p>
   <p>
    Raiser and Perlin are “pollinators” for the DC Greens Spring Dig 2016. (There are also “cultivators” and “worker bees”.)
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/T0NCt
   </p>
   <p>
    Perlin is the Chairman of DC Greens. Maggie Gyllenhaal is on the Board of Advisors.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/hV8on
   </p>
   <p>
    Here are its sponsors, including both Skye Raiser and David Perlin. This is likely the reason for the Washington Social List mentions.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation donated to DC Greens this year, according to DC Greens.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/3cJYT
   </p>
   <p>
    There is no evidence of a donation from the Cafritz Foundation website.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/6XA4V
   </p>
   <p>
    EDIT 5:
   </p>
   <p>
    Here's a mind-map so far.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://sli.mg/qZNvKj
   </p>
   <p>
    There's more to come people. There's no end to these elitist scumbags' incest.
   </p>
   <p>
    EDIT 6:
   </p>
   <p>
    The Cafritz Foundation also donates to Transformer. As does the S&amp;R Foundation.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/vPk18
   </p>
   <p>
    Goldman Sachs, along with many other financial institutions, donate to the S&amp;R Foundation. As does "Jay Cohen Comet Ping Pong".
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/Wk5bs
   </p>
   <p>
    Could Jay Cohen be James Alefantis' real name? Keep this in mind...
   </p>
   <p>
    Comet Ping Pong lists Media Matters as one of its friends.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/Y29fF
   </p>
   <p>
    Media Matters owns CTR and has ben linked to Clinton and money laundering.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/F3ARo
   </p>
   <p>
    Another friend is Don Rockwell, a food forum. Looks like it could be legit, but then again a mod is named 'Cheezepowder' (CP?)
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/DRyvt
   </p>
   <p>
    Does DanielK's last review look shady to anyone?
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/KyJrC
   </p>
   <p>
    Another one of Comet Ping Pong's friends is Hemphill Gallery, which often hosts receptions for a non-profit called HER Resiliency Center. There is a Sacha Cohen on HER's Advisory Board.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/KNVzM
   </p>
   <p>
    Sacha Cohen's full bio from HER. She's written for WaPo.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/jwt01
   </p>
   <p>
    Her website.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/rgjXR
   </p>
   <p>
    Could she be related to the 'Jay Cohen Ping Pong' that donated to the S&amp;R Foundation?
   </p>
   <p>
    Is that a reach? How about this:
   </p>
   <p>
    Another friend of Comet Ping Pong is the Politics &amp; Prose Bookstore. It is located across the street from Comet Ping Pong. It was opened by a Carla Cohen.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/4gorD
   </p>
   <p>
    Could this Carla Cohen be related 'Jay Cohen Comet Ping Pong' that donated to S&amp;R? Could she be related to Sacha Cohen of HER Resiliency Center?
   </p>
   <p>
    People have been talking about the font on the front of Politics &amp; Prose's building. Just like the FBI logos. Also, that '&amp;' looks particularly swirly.
   </p>
   <p>
    https://sli.mg/xPjoy0
   </p>
   <p>
    Another one of Comet Ping Pong's other friends, Brightest Young Things, is based in the WeWork building in DC. There is a founder named only 'Cale', who is in charge of 'pizza costumes'. Notice also the "Hail Satan."
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/S5PIn
   </p>
   <p>
    Another founder of BYT is Svetlana Legetic. She is Serbian, like Marina Abramovic. Might mean nothing..
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/geBf4
   </p>
   <p>
    The Ladies Who Lunch. This is a group of ladies who get together for lunch. Izette Folger hosted. There were many of note in attendance.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/KNK8Q
   </p>
   <p>
    First, Carol Joynt wrote the article. A producer and publisher, who wrote a memoir featuring dark details about her husband. "He possessed a dark side... physical abuse..." Mightn't be related...
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/3AT9E
   </p>
   <p>
    Second, Carole Feld. She is Married to David C. Levy, who is part of the prestigious Cosmos Club. Only the cream of the crop get in. Presidents and such. Super elite.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/8vt8L
   </p>
   <p>
    Is there something symbolic about Cosmos and Comets?
   </p>
   <p>
    Thirdly - and this is where it gets interesting -
   </p>
   <p>
    Our Ladies Who Lunch writer says that the Washington Ballet hosts the best balls.
   </p>
   <p>
    This reminded me that Comet Ping Pong list the Washington Ballet as a 'friend' on their site.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/Y29fF
   </p>
   <p>
    Also, Washington Ballet has three of our usual suspects on their Board of Directors - the Cafritz Family, David Dorros, and Huberta von Voss-Wittig (who we will meet soon...)
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/fJvT2
   </p>
   <p>
    Another Lady Who Lunches, who wished to remain anonymous but said she was part of the Washington Ballet, said that she was looking forward to the annual ball at the German Ambassador's Residence.
   </p>
   <p>
    No big deal. Until we see that the German Ambassador is Pete Wittig.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/3PKJX
   </p>
   <p>
    He is married to Huberta von Voss-Wittig, from the Washington Ballet Board of Directors above.
   </p>
   <p>
    Huberta von Voss-Wittig also, in the fall of 2016, joined the Seeds of Peace - a non-profit - as Director of Communications.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/DqIVa
   </p>
   <p>
    Seeds of Peace is funded in part by the Clinton Global Initiative. It is also funded (or funds?) children's non-profits, such as Save A Child's Heart.
   </p>
   <p>
    THE CONNECTIONS ARE TOO MUCH.
   </p>
   <p>
    TL:DR:

     Maybe follow that Zimbio link and look at people that are in photographs with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such as Sheila Johnson of BET. Or Skye Raiser. Or people on the board of Transformer.
    </p>
    <p>
     I guess there'll be dead ends before we find a good lead. But it seems full of promise. Literally the first person I looked into was directly connected to Clinton.

    This isn't very helpful, and I'll continue to dig through all information posted, but I wanted to note that there is, in fact, a Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington DC.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Each year, the National Cherry Blossom Festival commemorates the 1912 gift of 3,000 cherry trees from Mayor Yukio Ozaki of Tokyo to the city of Washington, DC. The gift and annual celebration honor the lasting friendship between the United States and Japan and the continued close relationship between the two countries.
    </p>

     Thanks. Is there an archiving 101? New to being so nimble.

     Thought the adults might pick it up and run with it.

      Well you are off to a great, super nimble start :)
     </p>
     <p>
      You can use archive.is for now.  There is another archiving site people have been using as well, but there is word it may have been compromised. So far archive.is seems to be okay, but if you can get screenshots of the evidence you find too, that will provide a safe backup.
     </p>
     <p>
      And
      <a href="https://github.com/PedoHunter/pizzagate">
       here is the Git repository
      </a>
      for uploading evidence as a safeguard.
     </p>

      I'm just now discovering the Izette Folger connection so I have a lot of catching up to do.

       Thanks. I'll see what I can do. Screenshotting to sli.mg is a cinch at the very least.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've only seen the Izette Folger mention once, in the link at the very top. But that rabbit-hole seems deep. As they all do, at this stage...
