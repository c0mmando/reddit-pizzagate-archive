        <p><p>Is that possible? How would it be done and how would someone (more than one, ideally) do that?</p></p>

        <p><p>Look at the response from the advisors. We didn't tell them to get brazen and think of themselves as untouchable gods. Soooo much smarter than the rest of us. We were never gonna figure it out right? Fuck those pedophiles.  Take that shit to court so we get to invoke the right of discovery and let's see if 12 peers think we are crazy </p></p>

        <p><p>There is no expectation of privacy when you put things on public forums. They do not have any recourse unless they can show that someone attacked them negligently or maliciously (and for public figures like Podesta it has to be malicious) Our evidence is circumstantial. We need actual victims or perpetrators to step forward. We cannot make this subreddit private. We need public outrage.</p></p>
