        <strong>Question for this community.</strong>
        <p><p>Is all of this revolution of people waking up to the corruption valid? For years studying all these conspiracies has created an anti trust attitude in anything that is fed to me, and I'm sure the same for many of you as well,  but it gets me thinking is this all set up? These leaks,  these scandals,  they all seem fed to us. Yes investigation was done but on a platform given to us. I'm not saying it's not but Im also saying we should be vigilant and not jump into any assumption based on emotion. Because there is one truth I hold dear to my heart in dealing with political and world matters and that the Bible is clear that at one point a one world order will take place and it will control the entire population of the planet.  Not sure how this thread will be looked upon,  I feel many of the newer users will not be able to see what I am saying without being offended. Love to hear each person's thoughts though.</p></p>

        <p><p>Judge by their actions, not their words. Have a second look at all the things we've dismissed as "normal" because of the media. Literally, how on earth does $500 million Haiti donations vanish in "thin air"? 500 million, in America, can pay for 1000 healthy lifetimes. Exponentially more in Haiti.</p>
<p>How often do you lose even $1? Just drop it? I realized all along we were being tricked and brainwashed. Too many things that are impossible to overlook. They are wearing human's skin, pretending to be one of us. They're not.</p></p>

        <p><p>I believe this is 100% real. Absolutely. What im saying is beyond this,  it seems they are being used to take a fall,  like a pawn being sacrificed to bait the people into making themselves vulnerable. Also I didn't realize I crossed into /r/pizzagate,  I thought I was still on /r/conspiracy </p></p>

        <p><p>I get you, I don't think this is going to solve the problem in the end even if the Clintons are taken down. We need to cut the problem by the root, but the tree is too big. Clintons are only a branch. I honestly am not sure about Trump, whether he'll be another puppet or actually is on our side. I've never believed in god before, but for the first time I am praying that Trump is a true human being.</p>
