        <strong>Traumatized Girl found in Italy, has been there for 3 weeks. Is it Madeline McCann? When did we link Podesta to her?</strong>

        <p><p>Think about it, if the Podestas/Clinton gang had McCann and knew we had found compelling evidence, do you really believe they would just dump her in Italy for her to be found?</p>
<p>We already know their connections, hideouts, etc. etc. and we know they murder people.</p>
<p>Do you really think they would let McCann who would've been with them for years just go free after what they've done to her?</p>
<p>It's worth seeing what is found out about this traumatized girl but don't get stuck on waiting to see what that girl has to say, your time is better spent on more plausible leads detectives.</p></p>
