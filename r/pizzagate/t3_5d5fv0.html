<strong>Alefantis speaks 15 Nov - blames everyone else, doesn't address any of the evidence employs usual leftist tactic of names calling</strong>
<p><p>http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/news/article/20842321/the-consequences-of-pizza-gate-are-real-at-comet-ping-pong</p>
<p>So at last he speaks. After a week. Predictably he calls the attackers "conspiracy theorist, white nationalists made up largely of racists, homophobic individuals who loosely tie together theories and do not attempt to find the truth, and when they do find truth that dispels their theories, they ignore it." </p>
<p>Whilst not addressing any of the evidence, the creepy artwork, hashtags, comments, photos, the repeated claims its a family place great for kids, even on Friday evening whilst promoting inappropriate material EG http://thedailysouth.southernliving.com/2008/04/28/comet-ping-pong/ and even though there are bands with dark themes and lyrics playing (EG - Sex Stains - what a perfect evening for kids!</p>
<p>Alefantis is clearly shaking and employing his media friends to protect him. Too late, the cat is out the bag. </p></p>

<p><p>Don't stoop anywhere near his level. Don't call name calling a leftist tactic. This could be completely true, and is in my opinion, but this will steer people away from examining the evidence for themselves.</p></p>

<p><p>It is not a fucking leftist tactic.  This is not political.  You are creating a false dichotomy.  This is good vs evil.  There are good liberals.  There are good conservatives.  There is also evil on both sides.  This is the type of ridiculous over-simplification that will ruin this investigation.</p></p>

<p><p>The only reason that it seems that we are attacking leftists is because this started with leaked emails from democrats. I have no doubt that there are just as many conservatives involved in this, but we have to work with the evidence that we have so far. If we get info on conservatives, we will work just as hard to expose them. This isn't about politics, it's about protecting kids.</p></p>

<p><p>Name calling is not exclusive to the left and saying it is, is divisive.  I know that these emails were leaked from members of Hillary's inner circle.  Everyone does.  If emails leaked from powerful conservatives we would most likely find equally disturbing things.  Let us not divide, but come together for the goal of protecting children from abuse and removing the abusers from power.</p></p>

<p><p>Presupposing that we are all politically aligned is stupid, misguided and detracts from the goal of this investigation.  This is not a political mission, and there are no political affiliations.  You are either helping, or carrying out the abuse of children, or you are fighting to stop it.  It is not based on your political affiliation.  </p></p>

<p><p>Keep in mind jimmy pedo is ranked as one of the 50 most powerful people in DC. And the city paper did some hard shilling against frank winstead in response to him filing a complaint about comet using the sidewalk for pingpong and making themselves a traffic hazard (the video where  a kid can be heard screaming help from across the street)</p></p>

<p><p>I think my messages were routed to his alternative inbox...he is active right now. I posted this as a reply on something he shared. Is it too dramatic?  </p>
<p>Hey there, check your inbox! I'm not sure that facebook is letting my messages into your main inbox as we arent aquainted yet..It's very very important. Idk if you are aware but, comet has been linked to a LARGE scale child sex trafficking ring. We need your help to bring them down sir!! Thousands of people are working on breaking this case right now and any info you might have could be the info that does it. You inadvertently captured a big piece of evidence in one of your YouTube videos! Please read my message. You may be in danger!! We are aware that they stalked you when you raised complaints about traffic safety. Doesn't that seem a bit heavy handed? Please read my message or at least visit Reddit pizzagate and post there!! You could save the lives of countless children that are still being held!!</p></p>

<p><p>Facebook makes it difficult to find messages of people you aren't friends with. Doesn't show on normal Convo list and if he doesn't have messenger it might not have any way to notify him. Hopefully he can find the people trying to get ahold of him.</p></p>

<p><p>I haven't seen any evidence that he changed his name. Someone used their ancestry.com account to show his lineage, and it seemed to show that he was born with that name. If we do find evidence that he changed it to James Alefantis that would be extremely damning. I'm just going on the word of the poster with the ancestry.com account though; that guy could be a shill.</p></p>

<p><p>Just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5d6q61/this_isnt_about_right_vs_left_or_trump_vs_clinton/">made a post</a> about changing the language used so that curious individuals will take this more seriously and continue digging. I recommend reading it to help reduce future coverage like this.</p></p>

<p><p>Trump supporters on sites like Reddit and 4chan have long been looking for a stronger connection between Clinton and Jeffrey &gt;Epstein, a financial tycoon and sex offender whose plane Bill Clinton sometimes used.

<p><p>He is probably talking about /pol/ (as most really relevant research is from there anyway) and then Conspiracy theoreists, white nationalists, racists, and homophobes is really not to far off.</p></p>
