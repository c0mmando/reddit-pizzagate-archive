        <strong>LAMBDA pizza, did you say?</strong>
        <p><p>so you'd think lambda is just a greek letter, right? you'd be wrong</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Labda (Greek: Λάβδα).. daughter of the <strong>Bacchiad</strong> Amphion, and mother of <strong>Cypselus</strong>, by Eetion.[1] Her name was derived from the fact of <em>her feet being turned outward</em>, and thus resembling the letter lambda (Λ),[2] which, by the accounts of the most ancient Greek grammarians, was <strong>original</strong>ly pronounced labda [labda].</p>
<p>to account for the name Cypselus (cf. κυψἐλη, kypsele, "chest") accounted how <strong>Labda then hid the baby in a chest, and when the men had composed themselves and returned to kill it,</strong> they could not find it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe the name-chooser saw themselves as the protector of a child?</p>
<hr>
<p>Perhaps too coincidental </p>
<ul>
<li>son Cypselus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypselus </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>was the <strong>first tyrant</strong> of Corinth</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the tyrants usually seized power at the head of some popular support. Often the <em>tyrants</em> upheld existing laws and customs and were highly conservative as to <strong>cult practices</strong>, thus maintaining stability with little risk to their own personal security. As in Renaissance Italy, a <em>cult of personality naturally</em> <strong>substituted</strong> for the divine right of the <strong>former legitimate</strong> royal house.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the Bacchiadae heard two prophecies from the Delphic oracle that the son of Eëtion would overthrow their dynasty, and <strong>they planned to kill the baby</strong> once it was born</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He also increased trade</p>
</blockquote>
