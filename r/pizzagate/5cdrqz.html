    I'm not a sleuth or anything, but I thought it might be worth looking into this connection a little more. I mean, the dude was a legitimate presidential nominee who used to be the CEO of a pizza franchise (pizza seeming to be all the rage right now with symbols). His campaign was also derailed with sexual harassment complaints. I don't want to suggest he's part of it or anything, but I feel like a  connections made to him would be very strange given the fact that he was so closely involved with pizza for such a long time and seemingly went straight from the pizza industry to working in D.C.

    When he said he thought the bible was more important than the constitution...he shot himself in the ass. Forget him.
