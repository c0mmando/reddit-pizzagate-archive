        <strong>Cathy O'Brien claimed that politicians performed rituals on her, raped her, and sliced her vagina with razor blades when she was a child. A gynecologist checked her vagina to see if she was telling the truth. CONFIRMED: she was really sliced up in a ritualistic pattern. [Video proof]</strong>
        <p><p>For over two decades, Cathy O'Brien has claimed that politicians, including Hillary Clinton, sexually abused her as a child, and mutilated her in traumatizing rituals. People thought she was crazy, though her story has never changed. You can read her description of what it was like when Hillary Clinton forced her to perform oral sex. Here it is in detail: https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5deqjr/firsthand_account_of_what_hillary_clinton_did_to/</p>
<p>In that same thread, a commenter dug up an old video where a gynecologist checks Cathy's vagina to see if she's telling the truth. Sure enough, the exam revealed multiple lacerations and cuts on Cathy's genitals, and the video shows EVERYTHING, close up. (You have been warned.)</p>
<p>Start around the 9 minute mark: https://youtu.be/Laon3_ob54A</p>
<p>It can no longer be denied that Cathy's genitals were sliced ritualistically. </p>
<p>Now we are forced to choose the most plausible explanation:</p>
<p>Either (1) Cathy is lying and sliced up her own vagina several times, slowly, in a ritualistic way, with razor blades;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>(2) Cathy is telling the truth and someone sliced her vagina in a ritual. </p>
<p>By all reasonable standards, (2) is the best explanation of the available data. We have clear evidence that Cathy was part of a ritual whose participants tortured her. </p>
<p>Adding to this, we have multiple, independent attestation that the Clintons are involved in child sex trafficking as well as the occult, along with all of the evidence we have uncovered in recent weeks, along with Cathy's own testimony (and she has proven herself to be truthful).</p>
<p>Either all of these people are crazy and lying and we are all imagining things and a child sliced her own vagina,</p>
<p>OR </p>
<p>the Clintons and their associates are indeed involved in child ritual abuse and trafficking. </p>
<p>HOW MUCH more is it going to take for these people to be brought to justice? </p>
<p>Do they need to slaughter a child on live TV? </p>
<p>(Even then, I'm sure their throngs would say it's "just art.")</p></p>

        <p><p>No. Meme magic is the collective consciousness. The world is awakening. We must cheerlead and spread the truth if we are to have any hope of peace. These are the same people that started WW2.</p></p>

        <p><p>Not sure if you're bringing up the collective consciousness on purpose but it's a real thing, and we are all connected, because we are all one and made from the same source energy.</p>
<p>This is all possible because we are all linked. By being connected energetically in such a way, news like this spreads around easier when it's hits a certain critical mass.</p>
<p>By us talking about this, in a connected, integrated way, it amplifies that output of consciousness and speeds up awareness.</p>
<p>This all may sound like Mumbo jumbo but please believe me when I say we are doing this for the collective good. Please stay together, don't let us become divided, and we can bring this whole thing down.</p>
<p>Meme magic is real. Collective consciousness is real. And we have the personal power to all help and do our part to make this happen and let the light shine in these places.</p></p>

        <p><p>Memes in the wrong hands often backfire.</p>
<p>My suggestion for making those Biden memes go away is to take them to the extreme and either make them obviously or insidiously malicious. Co-opt and over-saturate the meme taken from another turn or angle and people will lose interest fast.</p></p>

        <p><p>It still works on much of the people. Wich is why news organizations have so much psychological control over the formation of mass-public-thought. Which is why we must create and offer the solutions to those who may not know that what they put in them is what becomes of them.</p></p>

        <p><p>"This all may sound like Mumbo jumbo"</p>
<p>I know right? I used to think any talk of collective consciousness was new agey weirdness, however; the snow monkey study is pretty hard to refute...have you seen that one?  Basically, snow monkeys in Japan figured out how to use tools or something, and then snow monkeys on neighboring islands that had no physical contact with the first group started mirroring the behavior.</p>
<p>So, there is something to it....and I get what you are saying.   It seems like this (pizzagate) may be hitting critical mass?</p>
<p>Another esoteric thought I have about all of this, is that any one instance is easily enough dismissed...but when you start looking at all of the pedo, ritual abuse and human trafficking scandals that have occurred in the recent past on every continent, you hear shocking similar stories from children and adult survivors.   That is a whole lot of smoke with no fire.  </p></p>

<p>You're repeating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundredth_monkey_effect">Hundredth monkey effect</a> story, which seems to grow on each retelling. It's not actually something that ever happened though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An analysis of the appropriate literature by Ron Amundson, published by the Skeptics Society, revealed several key points that demystified the supposed effect.</p>
<p>Unsubstantiated claims that there was a sudden and remarkable increase in the proportion of washers in the first population were exaggerations of a much slower, more mundane effect. Rather than all monkeys mysteriously learning the skill it was noted that it was predominantly younger monkeys that learned the skill from the older monkeys through observational learning, which is widespread in the animal kingdom; older monkeys who did not know how to wash tended not to learn. As the older monkeys died and younger monkeys were born the proportion of washers naturally increased. The time span between observations by the Japanese scientists was on the order of years so the increase in the proportion was not observed to be sudden.</p>
<p>Claims that the practice spread suddenly to other isolated populations of monkeys may be called into question given the fact that at least one washing monkey swam to another population and spent about four years there and also the monkeys had the researchers in common. Amundson also notes that the sweet potato was not available to the monkeys prior to human intervention. The number of monkeys in the colony was counted as 59 in 1962 indicating that even in numbers no "hundredth monkey" existed.</p>

        <p><p>See, I can see how people would arrive at this conclusion, but the missing link people aren't aware of is that it's not the collective consciousness that's causing this, it's God.  If the collective consciousness was real, we'd be being influenced by the thought patterns of the massive populations in China and India.  But if you look at all these events as dominoes falling one after another, each revelation priming us for another reveal, it's very easy to see how <em>intentional</em> this pattern of events is.  God is playing 47D chess here in order to help us and bring us closer to Him, and we're seeing the results.</p></p>

        <p><p>That's <strong>exactly</strong> what Loud_Volume just said.</p>
<p>Collective consciousness = God. Source = God, the illusion of individuality is simply that, as we are all 'children of God', I.E an expression of Source energy, I.E subjects of the collective consciousness, which is God.</p></p>

        <p><p>Funny you should mention "collective consciousness".  I am currently reading Illuminati:  The Cult that Hijacked the World.  They pdf is available online for free.  </p>
<p>http://www.stopthecrime.net/Henry-Makow---Illuminati----(2008).PDF</p>
<p>The author discussed an egregore.  According to Wikipedia, "egregore"  is an occult concept  representing  a  "thought form" or "collective group mind", an autonomous  psychic entity made up of, and influencing, the thoughts of a group  of people. The symbiotic relationship  between  an egregore  and its group  has been compared to the more recent,  non-occult  concepts  of the  corporation  (as a legal entity)  and the  meme."  Pg. 59.  </p>
<p>Is the egregore Lucifer, who is worshiped by the super rich?  </p>
<p>I agree with you.  We need to stick together.  The fight is not Left vs. Right or Democrat vs. Conservative.  The fight it the super rich vs. everybody else.  Trump is not super rich by these standards.  Neither is Bill Gates.  If Bill Gates was among the super rich, then he would not be listed in Forbes among the world's wealthiest.  The world's wealthiest remain behind the scenes so it is more difficult to attack them.  </p></p>

<p>I think we owe it to this woman to look. It's soul crushing, but how fucking brave to come forward with it. Shit, to have someone get in there with a telescopic lens to take close up pictures and then be put in the film itself. </p>
<p>I hate to say it, but man up. This is the kind of evil that you need to see in order to never allow yourself to become complacent or allow it to occur again.</p></p>

        <p><p>What pissed me off the most was the fact that they carved a face into her.... What kind of sick fuck takes the time to carve a face... Then Hillary getting turned on by it..
We are dealing with the worst of humanity with these creatures and to think they have held the highest positions in government makes it all the more deplorable.
If there is a hell I hope every single one of them reach the depths of it.
On their death bed, I hope they see visions of what is going to happen to them and feel the pain and wrath of their actions.</p></p>

        <p><p>100% agree with everything you said. As Christians we are taught to pray for the sinner to repent... but these people are so far gone that it seems prayers should go to other people. May they rot in hell.</p></p>

        <p><p>The question I have of this kind of stuff, and I was unable to watch it all so I may have missed some key things, is "why?" </p>
<p>Why would someone do that to a person, or even an animal for that matter? A ritualized carving on the genitals of a girl makes no sense.</p>
<p>There are markings humans use on animals, such as branding, but that makes sense because the brand is an identifier on livestock. I "get" that - but why would someone do this stuff to that woman's genitals? </p>
<p>I don't get it. At all. That's not a humble brag. It's not a "oh, look at me! I'm not a sexual deviant!!!"</p>
<p>I'm truly confused.</p></p>

        <p><p>They break people's ability to think for themselves, to critically analyze the situation, the last bastion of "true" freedom. It is a form of mind control. They threaten anyone who wants to come forward and speak the truth. They want you to believe they are all powerful and can just kidnap you and your family at any given moment and get away with it.</p>
<p>It is all based on childhood torture and research into mind control stemming from Freudian Psychoanalytics, the Frankfurt School, Tavistock, and the globalist elite cabal.</p></p>

        <p><p>Isn't it convenient when your victims are ritually drugged and abused into mental states that discredit them?</p>
<p>Maybe we should start cross referencing public admissions of dissociative identity disorder with personal connections to politicians.</p>
<p>We need victims to come forward for this shit to go anywhere.</p></p>

<p>Method is basically mind controlling yourself and creating a dissociated identity.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah it definitely went off the rails in season 2 and it took years for me to go back and finish it.</p>
<p>But the first season was probably my favorite series ever.  And the last is still pretttty hard to turn off.  Definitely feels like some dissociative identity problems.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's all true...I am a surviver of this kind of abuse...I have  scars on my hands arms and fingers ( similar to pedesta scars...they look like scalpel cuts...very old and clearly there) ....I only have snippets of memories... but I do have a very clear memory of a face..a face of a man who picked me up in a car when I was 12 years old....an unforgettable face whose smile I will never forget.and his cheshere cat grin of a man who had snared his canary ...google General Michael Aquino ....look at that face that smile...I'll never forget the feeling I had when I got in the car with him...Instant dissociation and the thought Oh my God I am going to be killed....Many years later  that one memory that my soul let me remember helped me to come out of denial and start to heal from the trauma of my childhood...An ongoing process....We need to collectively now come out of denial so that we can stop this together and start the healing...It has to stop...It starts with us accepting the truth that yes evil really is that evil....and It can only thrive as long as we stay in denial and let the darkness prevail....I'm not sure what we can do other then speak the truth and keep working to expose it....</p></p>

        <p><p>You know, it's hard to be sure about posts like this on the internet... so many trolls and fakes... but I just wanted to say that if this is true I have the utmost respect for you having the bravery to share your horrific experiences. Lets hope together that the light is finally shone on these savages in this coming year, and if not, well thousands of people everywhere have become aware. That's a huge difference and at this point I'd hazard to say irreversible damage to their cover.</p></p>

        <p><p>Unfortunately, the SRA angle is, in fact, far too easy to discredit.</p>
<p>While true, we should keep it on the DL when talking to normies. Disinfo agents like David Icke have been very successful at leaking facts mixed with unbelievable bullshit (THE QUEEN IS A REPTILOID!) so that any exposé of actual occult activity will be met with instant skepticism.</p>
<p>WEH HAVE TO MAKE AN AIRTIGHT CASE FOR THE PEDO RING <strong>FIRST</strong>. Then and only then can even a whisper of occultism/Satanism go to the press.</p></p>

        <p><p>Meh. Spirit cooking was huge.</p>
<p>I know what you mean and you're not a concern troll.  But you have to remember conspiracy theories stick around for a reason.  Ppl love crazy.  We need enough participation to reach a level of compiled evidence.  What they say about us along the way doesn't matter that much.</p>
<p>SRA gives them ammunition to discredit us.  Is it enough?  I kinda don't think so.</p></p>

        <p><p>I was just thinking about a book that a friend of mine needed for her sexology degree which has been banned in the US. It's called "The Sexual Life of Children" and is a study of sexual development through childhood.  Her program covered weird sexual proclivities including "The Dictionary of Unusual Sex Practices" as well as paedophilia. </p>
<p>I was thinking that SLoC might help identify the ages at which ritual abuse would be most effective, letting us narrow the list of potential victims or missing persons.</p>
<p>Just a thought if someone is able to procure a copy of that book in PDF form or something.</p></p>

        <p><p>They need to be protected before they can come forward. I had a friend who told me about her experience. Lucky for me she did, or they would have gotten me. Her warning save my life. </p>
<p>Would I encourage her to come forward with her story? Never! Not in a million years. She already came forward, she told me about it and I believe her. I think that is enough. I will be the activist for both of us. </p></p>

<p>What will it take?</p>
<p>And your name reminds me of a story i heard.  Renegade nuns infiltrating sex traffickers.</p>
<p>Maybe that's a reasonable group to reach out to.</p></p>

        <p><p>Bro, if you want to see one of these people for yourself, search for "Gabriel croft" "government sex slave" and "prosody context" </p>
<p>He goes by those three terms, but in one of his videos he calls himself "Gabriel Croft, Government sex slave".</p>
<p>He is clearly schizophrenic  at this point. Can someone please she'd some light into this guy's videos on youtube?</p></p>

<p>Wrong. </p>
<p>Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.</p>
<p>Self-harm is almost pandemic. It's more common among girls. People lie. A lot of people lie outrageously. There are people who can't stop themselves lying even when they know everyone in the room knows the truth.</p>
<p>A report in the UK was published recently into how the lies of one such person resulted in the police being fooled into announcing investigation into at least half a dozen politicians and senior military personnel. The High Court Judge who wrote the report said sometimes people make false allegations for no discernible reason.</p>
<p>I'm sorry for this young lady. It seems like there have been some terrible things in her life.</p>
<p>But there's no more evidence to conclude that she was sexually abused by Hillary Clinton than there is to prove that Barack Obama is a Kenyan.</p></p>

        <p><p>Right.  Self-harm is very common, and genitals seem to be a target for people who have either been abused or have feelings of shame associated with their genitals.  Also, claiming the government is out to get you is very common in certain mental disorders (my birth mother thinks the government is stalking her).  It could all be true, but it also could not be.</p></p>

        <p><p>People want to believe they are taking down a huge pedo group. </p>
<p>We might very well be, but we need to be careful of believing something because we want to believe at an emotional level instead of believing something because implication and evidence gives no other choice.</p>
<p>We will need "blood in the trunk " so to speak.
When there is blood in the trunk of a car, forensics will take a DNA sample and match it against the victim. If it was the victim then that proces beyond a doubt, not that the suspect killed the victim - but that the victim was bleeding in the trunk of that car.</p>
<p>It's a huge piece of evidence but people need to understand how evidence is viewed. Victims blood in the trunk means the victim bled in the trunk, it does not outright prove the suspect killed the victim and stuck then in the trunk. Even with that  smoking gun , one still needs to connect the suspect to the act, other wise we can only know that the victim was in the trunk of the car, bleeding. By not who did it.</p></p>

        <p><p>What makes the premise of it not being true any more concrete? Where is the evidence that she has a history of self harm?</p>
<p>Edit 1: being downvoted for asking for evidence from people saying there needs to be evidence to substantiate an assertion. Classic reddit. Whoever decided to let their pride get in the way of being objective is more concerned with being right than finding the facts. Good luck to you, have fun living in the matrix.</p></p>

        <p><p>Heres the thing, Socrates. I asked a question and questions require answers, jot some stupid rhetoric distorting the point i am trying to make.</p>
<p>I have made no claims. I asked where the evidence was that she had self harmed, which was an insinuation of the comment i replied to. So what evidence is there supporting she has a history of self harm?</p>
<p><em>if</em> i make big claims. I have made none. Others have and fail to provide the same standard of proof you require those who you disagree with to make. Does that seem fair to you?</p>
<p>Try going to a trial. You have to disprove claims people make all the time that are accepted as being true because people are willing to put theor hand on a bible. Truth isn't always what it seems.</p></p>

</blockquote>
<p>How do you prove that claim? If that was the case, and there was no need for anyone to disprove your claims than anyone could make erroneous claims as being proof that wouldnt be disproven because according to your argument there is no requirement for claims to be disproven.</p></p>

        <p><p>That fucking face - it doesn't seem likely that she did it herself. Not to say who did, but it's flawlessly symmetrical in an upright orientation. </p>
<p>If she was doing that to herself, wouldn't there be errors associated with carving what would have been an upside down carving for the carver?</p>
<p>That said, I am done talking about this, so fucking terrible... </p></p>

        <p><p>I don't know that the girl herself was responsible. I'm just pointing to possibilities that are <em>at least</em> as plausible as Hillary Clinton being involved.</p></p>

        <p><p>Just as much evidence to prove it was self harm too. Iam not disagreeing that it is a possibility, however your argument defeats itself. You are making an argument that she has no evidence and you have no evidence of that yourself. The video offers no evidence, however there is a world beyond these 12 minutes of video. Just because it isnt addressed here doesnt mean it doesnt exist. For instance, there was no evidence that oxygen existed in 1400.......it sure as shit did...</p>
<p>Your high court judge in the uk that wrote that report is also part of a justice.ministry that was a conspirator to covering up institutionalized pedophilia from government officials in its own jurisdiction...so there is that too...not that the points that the report made are invalid those points have ben legitimized well before their report, but that has to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Proof has to be sought, discerned and found. You cant expect it to be handed to you. It has to be faught to be incovered for what it is: truth. Those who rely on being told what proof is or what evidence does or doesnt exist are easily misled.</p></p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a fundamental misunderstanding of logic. </p>
<p>Of course there's evidence that oxygen existed in 1400. You need a better analogy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your high court judge in the uk that wrote that report is also part of a justice.ministry that was a conspirator to covering up institutionalized pedophilia from government officials in its own jurisdiction...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You've got it  backward. It is the allegations of a man [named 'Frank' for the purposes of the investigation] <em>about the institutionalised paedophilia</em> that were shown to be false (because, e.g., he expressly cited dates that were factually impossible) that Lord Justice Henriques was examining, in the context of reviewing the police investigation which even the police have now admitted was fundamentally flawed. </p>
<p>I don't expect proof to be handed to me, <em>not for the things I want to prove</em>. But if someone wants me to accept that Hillary Clinton was responsible for cutting a teenage girls vagina into shreds then they are def-fucking-nitely going to have to provide me with very solid evidence - and the same should go for everyone else.</p>
<p>The saying goes that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and it's a good saying to live by.</p></p>

        <p><p>The point is that the people in 1400 had no mechanism to effectively analyze that oxygen existed. That does not negate the fact that oxygen did indeed exist then albeit an existence beyond their perception. The point is just because the evidence isnt there in front of you doesnt mean it isn't there. It may just mean it hasnt been uncovered.</p>
<p>Again, i am skeptic as anyone. I understand the points about self harm, etc. How are those relavent and not speculative? Does anyobe have evidence she has a history of self harm? People that have shizophrenia often suffer from delusions of grandeur in which stories like these are manifest in their minds but that is a rather irrelevant point to bring up if the women is not shizphrenic. While it <em>can</em> offer a more lilely explanation, it doesn't mean that it <em>does</em> offer one.</p>
<p>Now, if you would answer my question after i have repeatedly asked it...do you have any evidence that this woman has a history of inflicting self harm?</p></p>

<p>No, the point is that animals respiring oxygen and expiring CO2 and plants respiring CO2 and expiring oxygen were obviously around then - because it is a logical necessity to produce the world today - and so THERE'S SO MUCH FUCKING EVIDENCE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE HOW YOU FUCKED IT UP.</p>
<p>Learn to read posts more carefully. It's part of the process of being on the internet. I didn't say it was self-harm; I was showing that there are alternatives at least as likely as the one proposed by OP.</p>

        <p><p>Woof dude. Thats the point, the oxygen and evidence was there but people living then didnt have the means to analyze it. That doesnt negate its existence. Just because it is beyond perception doesnt mean it isnt there. No one os saying oxygen didnt exist back then. My point is just because ot wasnt proven to exost doesnt mean it doesnt, which is essentially your point ie if there is no proof it isnt true.</p>
<p>Of course there are alternatives, like my shizoprenia example or maybe she is tripping balls on lsd during the exam...those are possible explanation but how are they relevant? Theres a possible, more likely explanation to anything that doesn't mean it is the correct explanation.</p></p>

        <p><p>Since I'm not American, and I don't live in America, I highly doubt I can be considered a Hillary supporter.</p>
<p>Of course, I am disturbed and unsettled by all the shit that is spewed about her on the web and on redditor, and it's my personal opinion that this feverish, febrile inclination to jump straight from normality to believing that the democratic candidate for president is a murderous, fraudulent child molester is a very bad thing indeed. </p></p>

        <p><p>Do you also deny her obscenely long list of war crimes, which includes total devastation of entire countries like Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen and Pakistan? Oh, you didn't get the memo that she was the one who greenlit the arming of ~~moderate~~murderous ~~rebels~~ terrorists in Syria and Iraq, a group which evolved into what we call ISIS? </p></p>

        <p><p>This is like that famous question: "When did you stop beating your wife?" It can't actually be answered, because dealing with it on its own terms gives no acceptable outcome. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You produce some <em>evidence</em> that Hillary is responsible for all those things, then we can talk. (I'm interested to see how she could be responsible for the devastation of Iraq, when the invasion started 6 years before she became SoS. Also, pretty sure that the Pakistanis aren't aware that their country is 'totally devastated'.)</p>

<p>Those things, if true, are bad; but they are light-years away from physically mutilating a teenage girl's genitals deliberately and at length.</p>

        <p><p>There's plenty of proof if you search earnestly. <a href="http://usuncut.com/politics/hillary-clinton-foreign-policy-record/">Here's one article with appropriate sources.</a> I didn't even mention the instability in Honduras or the mess that's post earthquake Haiti, which this article highlights quite clearly.</p>

<p>She voted for Iraqi war 'with conviction' and later wrote a book about it and made millions. Look up warmongering in your dictionary.</p>
<p>Also, I'm half-Pakistani, so I know of what I speak. Drone bombing northern areas of Pakistan has cost thousands of innocent lives. She has supported it unequivocally.</p></p>

        <p><p>See, here's where it gets so exasperating.</p>
<p>'supporting' something doesn't make you responsible for it.</p>
<p>I don't care if you're the President of Pakistan redditing from your office, Pakistan has not been 'devastated' by anything Hillary Clinton has done, and in fact while parts of the country have been  badly affected by drone attacks, the country itself is not devestated at all; almost everyone in the country gets on with the process of living just like normal. (We won't get into the official if informal tolerating of islamic terrorist organisations in certain parts of Pakistan over more than two decades now and to what extent <em>that</em> underlies the current problems in those areas...)</p>
<p>The persons responsible for the devastation of Iraq are, quite simply and with no rational contrary argument available, George W Bush and his cabinet. Not only are they responsible, but because they lied and lied and misrepresented the facts, everyone who did vote for it was deceived and actually bears almost zero responsibility.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not well-versed in these things. </p>
<p>But I can give you an illustration. In the UK in the 80s we heard about a - not sure if it was a test or an observation. In certain circumstances if the anus of a very young child relaxed and opened while a child was being examined, this was said by experienced paediatricians to be conclusive evidence of anal penetration.</p>
<p>Later it turned out both a) untrained paediatricians had mistakenly diagnosed abuse because of unfamiliarity with the test and b) it turns out it's not conclusive evidence of anal penetration anyway.</p>
<p>So... it's quite dangerous to look at any piece of evidence in isolation, there's no 'smoking gun' to find.</p></p>

        <p><p>Not only that, but just googling her name shows she's deep in to various conspiracy theories. Something about Project Monarch (seriously, like straight out of 'Quantum Break' type shit, only with mind control). If I had to take everything in to account, I'd say, odds are she's most likely a pretty disturbed individual who needs some real help. It's incredibly sad actually, when you get further in to her past as a public person. </p></p>

        <p><p>Shit, I'm upset he deleted it... Basically it was a screenshot of a thread on 4chan of someone claiming to be a part of Wikileaks' staff. He was issued a gag order and has been out of contact with the rest of staff and Julian since the internet was originally disconnected. He claims no one knows where Julian is and as far as he knows, Julian is dead. But most importantly, he urged <em>several</em> times not to leak <em>anything</em> on wikileaks because the CIA has commandeered it and is using it to find and prosecute whistle blowers.</p></p>

        <p><p>Hey guys, </p>
<p>I first posted in on another thread but, I realized this might not have been the best thread to talk about it so i'm trying here. </p>
<p>Basically I saw something a few weeks ago that I felt was stupid at the time but that is now scratching a small part of my brain. So here it is - and this is probably nothing - but a major pedo case occurred in Europe in the late 80's which officials records can be found on the wikileaks database. </p>
<p>I remember reading it and felling disgusting by all the things I was reading - most of the tortures that occurred seems to fit the descriptions of this poor woman here - and where does it start getting strange ? </p>
<p>Well it says in the files that the main suspect behind all this (Michel Fourniret if i recall correctly) was claiming during his interrogations to be in contact with powerful people such as George Bush and stuff. I don't really know what to make of it but hey, maybe there's some truth to it... </p></p>

        <p><p>Saw a few things the other day that made me scratch my head. Could be nothing but a few people are claiming that HRC does not have Parkinson's but actually has a disease called Kuru. Kuru is a prion disease linked to cannibalism and manifests similar symptoms to Parkinson's. </p>
<p>Recently Janet Reno died of "Parkinson's disease". 
I believe George HW also has Parkinson's. </p>
<p>It seems like they all run in similar circles. 
Kuru can be spread by eating prion carrying bodies/material. 
While there is probably no way to confirm the links, I found it interesting. </p></p>

        <p><p>Wait are you serious about Reno and Bush?</p>
<p>There's also that time traveler theory that claims the brain damage is caused by overuse of the time machine.</p>
<p>So we've got 4 competing theories.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pneumonia and nothing to see here.</li>
<li>Parkinson's in an outlier cluster.</li>
<li>Time travel related brain damage.</li>
<li>Brain disease from satanic ritual cannibalism.</li>
</ol>
<p>1 is a lie.  Obviously.  </p>
<p>2 is possible, but pretty unlikely.  .08% of the population is diagnosed every year.  That's messy but it's off by an order of magnitude or 2 to have 3 ultra elite cases.  Depends how many ppl you consider elite.  I'm thinking 10-20.</p>
<p>3 is impossible as far as we know.</p>
<p>4 is possible if the ultra elite are eating brains.</p>
<p>Personally, i really hope I'm wrong about time travel being impossible.</p></p>

        <p><p>Thank you.  Don't worry about nonsense.  We're used to sifting through everything plus trolling plus derailing by shills.</p>
<p>You're doing what i didn't want to do.</p>
<p>Lots of people jump in with Satanism lore.  And it's a big distraction unless it helps us connect dots in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Your dates list is absolutely worthwhile and interesting as a direction of research.  And if we start to find an undeniable statistical cluster of 'parkinsons' that would be fucking insane, just like many of the other revelations along the way.</p>
<p>Stick around.</p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks. I get it. I've been following the threads for a few weeks. I don't know one person who would want their Parkinson's like symptoms to be explained by Kuru-a prion disease from eating brains. Other symptoms of Parkinson's can be tremors, involuntary muscle movements, epilepsy. Not something worth pursuing actively but if we keep coming across politicians with Parkinson's disease and financial ties to Clintons, they are probably death eaters</p></p>

        <p><p>Why do you think Satanism is a big distraction? I consider it the root behind ritual pedophilia and worse(assumed cannibalism).</p>
<p>This isn't just some collection of pedophiles. That's just a means to an end.</p></p>

        <p><p>Because getting into the motivations of this is really horrifying.  I don't mean it as an insult.</p>
<p>This is the stuff that doesn't have an easy motivation.  And I'm not sure i want to learn about theirs.</p>
<p>I'm pretty curious if that direction will go anywhere.</p></p>

        <p><p>People think satanism is a "distraction" because it ties religious belief with it. If people don't believe in Satan than it seems ridiculous.</p>
<p>But the important thing is that these pedophiles and murderers actually do believe in Satan and that's all that's important. Just because they aren't actually channeling the power of Satan by performing these horrible rituals, they still believe they are and they will continue to do so.</p>
<p>Also, some people refuse to believe dark shit like this can happen. Consider how shocked people are to learn about a kidnapping or murder in their area. Now tell them that most of their government officials are cannibals, murderers, and rapists, and watch the widespread disbelief/denial.</p></p>

        <p><p>I have the same perspective.</p>
<p>Until pizza gate I've always considered these pedophile rings in society as a means to blackmail, control or as a gate keeper to only allow certain personalities further and create sociopaths by breaking people's moral programming. Give it some kind of "rational" perspective.</p>
<p>This whole secret society gnostic masonic/pagan stuff felt completely alien to me because there are not even hints visible in my country but that could have been pure ignorance.</p>
<p>But now we're at the stage to assume sacrifice/blood rituals and cannibalism as the last stage which is something I hadn't ever considered to be real on that level.</p>
<p>It makes me rethinking horrible serial killer cases if that wasn't just the top of the iceberg of these structures or collateral effects of people who came in contact and went completely rogue.</p>
<p>Have you seen the kid toys in the bedroom of Podesta? Now I can only conclude that these are <em>trophies</em> of his activities.</p></p>

        <p><p>Check for child trafficking reports from new Guinea as well as if the "researchers" were known Clinton associates or were friends with top politicians of their time. Look for things similar to how they were moving kids out of Haiti. WTF Wikipedia http://archive.is/x7PL3 kuru comes from New Guinea http://archive.is/RtqD9 which, according to Wikipedia, has a major problem with human trafficking. Wikipedia even says politicians lol... From state.gov http://archive.is/E4cQm this Kuru shit looks REALLY shady.. http://archive.is/ba5Wi why is HRC so interested in the health of PNG? She is building a hospital? Could it be from the Wikipedia article where they said some of the locals developed immunity to Kuru??? Asdfasdfadfgjsbfj!! The fuck?</p></p>

        <p><p>I think the law change is to make age of consent for homosexual sex the same as for heterosexual sex. So with the new law, 16 is the new age of consent but a 14 or 15 year old can legally have sex with someone who is less than 5 years older than they are.</p></p>

        <p><p>God damnit.  I thought the kuru thing was funny when i looked it up.  It was just so obviously Clinton's symptoms plus all her alleged symptoms(laughing, seizures, tantrums).  But I still didn't take it that seriously.</p>
<p>Wtf man.  Wtf man.  Wtf.  Wtf.  Wtf!!!!!</p>
<p>Burn it.  Burn it with fire.  Burn it all down.</p>
<p>Maybe Obama explained all this to Trump at the WH.  That would definitely explain his face afterwards.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well I'm not saying it's 100% true, buy it is 100% possible. She set New Guinea as her first trip as Secretary of state there for a reason. If it is true she doesn't have long to live so time may tell if we don't find evidence first.</p></p>

        <p><p>Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, the President of Argentina, has also suffered some strange medical problems. She had a mysterious brain bleed they said was due to a fall (just like Hillary), she broke her ankle with no further explanation (unsteady on her feet like Hillary), the Argentine people are suspicious of her medical team (just like the US is about Hillary's med team), Kirchner fired her doctor because she thought he was leaking info to the public, and Hillary was caught trying to get Kirchner's medical records because she wanted to know what medication she was on if any and how she was handling stress.  </p></p>

        <p><p>I tried to find out if Kirchner had been to Papua New Guinea, but no dice. Although, if she starts coughing uncontrollably and and gets a lesion on her tongue, the jig is up. </p></p>

        <p><p>The name kuru means “to shiver” or “trembling in fear.” The symptoms of the disease include muscle twitching and loss of coordination. Other symptoms include difficulty walking, involuntary movements, behavioral and mood changes, dementia, and difficulty eating. The latter can cause malnutrition. Kuru has no known cure. It’s usually fatal within one year of contraction.</p>
<p>The identification and study of kuru helped along scientific research in a number of ways. It was the first neurodegenerative disease resulting from an infectious agent. It led to the creation of a new class of diseases including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease, and fatal familial insomnia. Today the study of kuru still impacts research on neurodegenerative diseases.</p></p>

<p>If she had Kuru she'd be dead already. You don't just get symptoms like not being able to walk and then be able to have a debate weeks later. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah. Admittedly, I'm not well versed on Kuru, but it seems like symptoms may take up to 30 years to appear, and there may be different stages of progression for symptoms. Also, these people are very rich and may have access to specialized care. Can't rule it out</p></p>

        <p><p>FROM WIKIPEDIA ON KURU:
In the first (ambulant) stage, the infected individual may exhibit unsteady stance and gait, decreased muscle control, tremors, difficulty pronouncing words (dysarthria), and titubation. This stage is named because the individual is still able to walk around despite symptoms.[8]</p>
<p>In the second (sedentary) stage, the infected individual in is <strong>incapable of walking without support</strong> and suffers ataxia and severe tremors. Furthermore, the individual shows signs of emotional instability and depression, yet <strong>exhibits uncontrolled and sporadic laughter.</strong> Despite the other neurological symptoms, tendon reflexes are still intact at this stage of the disease.[8]</p>
<p>In the third and final (terminal) stage, the infected individual’s existing symptoms, like ataxia, progress to the point where they are no longer capable of sitting without support. New symptoms also emerge: the individual develops dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, which can lead to severe malnutrition. They may also become incontinent, lose the ability to speak and become unresponsive to their surroundings, despite maintaining consciousness.[8] Towards the end of the terminal stage patients often develop chronic ulcerated wounds that can be easily infected. An infected person usually dies within three months to two years after the first terminal stage symptoms, often because of pneumonia or infection.[9]</p>
<p>If she does have it, she is likely in stage 2. I cant find much on the progression on each stage, just the last stage. </p>
<p>The problem we have is that there is medication that can mask some of these symptoms.. </p>
<p>Further, here is a link to her having tremors during a debate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=925ihXI1lkE</p></p>

        <p><p>Check for child trafficking reports from new Guinea as well as if the "researchers" were known Clinton associates or were friends with top politicians of their time. Look for things similar to how they were moving kids out of Haiti. WTF Wikipedia http://archive.is/x7PL3 kuru comes from New Guinea http://archive.is/RtqD9 which, according to Wikipedia, has a major problem with human trafficking. Wikipedia even says politicians lol... From state.gov http://archive.is/E4cQm this Kuru shit looks REALLY shady.. http://archive.is/ba5Wi http://archive.is/ba5Wi why is HRC so interested in the health of PNG? She is building a hospital? Could it be from the Wikipedia article where they said some of the locals developed immunity to Kuru??? Asdfasdfadfgjsbfj!! The fuck?</p></p>

        <p><p>The term "Satanic Panic" was devised and propagated by the CIA and their front group known as the False Memory Syndrome Foundation in much the same way that the CIA utilised the equally vilifying "Conspiracy Theory". Both engineered terms are loaded and meant to both ridicule and discredit, designed to drive any interested parties from looking any further into real crimes.</p>
<p>The False Memory Syndrome Foundation was deployed during a critical time to spin and dismiss news accounts of actual ritual sexual assaults and murders that were reported and getting increasing coverage in the media. If you do some on-line research you'll find that the founders of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation were/are a collection of paedophiles, paid apologists in addition to MK-ULTRA connected individuals with backgrounds in military psychiatrics and research and development of mind-control experiments and operations.</p></p>

<p>Allegations made in a 100 million dollar lawsuit by someone without a lawyer, that no one has identified, interviewed, or even located. Suit was dismissed in CA, refiled in NY, and dismissed again. It's bullshit. Even the mainstream media (who was 1000% biased against Trump) didn't cover it.</p></p>

        <p><p>Deep connections? </p>
<p>They ran in similar social circles and seemingly were moderate acquaintances. Keep in mind that their types of people (billionaires) are different than you or me. We have friends over for dinner whose company we enjoy or whose spouse we tolerate because we like the other. Billionaires don't operate like that. I'm sure they do in some cases but not everyone that has dinner at someone else's house are friends with them the way we think of friends. </p>
<p>"Deep connections" makes it sound like they were BFFs. Epstein was a member at Trump's resort. Trump ate dinner with a large group of influential people at Epstein's house once. I don't see any "deep connections". He may have flown on his plane one time, but even that isn't anywhere in the logs like Clinton's 26 flights.  </p>
<p>Even Virginia Roberts' lawyer, who subpoenaed Trump in 09, says: </p>
<p>"During the conversation, Mr. Trump was open and forthright," Edwards said. "I cannot discuss the substance of the conversation. But I will say that it was obvious to me that he was in no way involved in any untoward activity." </p>
<p>So even if they knew each other deeper than in passing, if the lawyer of the suit that is naming Epstein, Alan Dershowitz and Prince fucking Andrew of the British Royal family (among others) as guilty parties isn't throwing Trump in there, there must not be much, if anything, there. </p></p>

        <p><p>No, it's not only the Clintons. It's all of the globalists' (like George Soros) puppet politicians (on both sides of the political coin). Trump does not fall into that category.  </p>
<p>Now if he passes the TPP through as is without renegotiating it to benefit America or doesn't start the process of building the wall, or capitulates to any other globalist agendas that don't benefit America, then I'll start to question whether or not they've got something on him. But as it stands at the moment, Trump is not falling in line with the globalist agenda. And that's because he doesn't have to, because he isn't afraid of them blackmailing him. </p></p>

        <p><p>If any of them had any even remotely legitimate appearance of merit you would have heard about them, while the ones against Clinton were unreported (much like the tax loophole that Trump and Clinton both used was only reported on as if Trump did it). </p>
<p>And they aren't reporting on pizzagate because if they were to do so without substantive evidence, Podesta et al would sue their asses into oblivion. All we have right now is a series of loosely connected dots based on emails that <strong>seemingly</strong> contain codewords. And let's be honest, Reddit doesn't have the best history of detective work. Ask the Tripathi family. </p></p>

        <p><p>Except we did hear about them! Haven't heard anything about Podesta banding kids yet either but that's almost a fact at this point. Face it, Trump has a real chance at either being connected, or molesting kids on his own.</p></p>

        <p><p>The allegations materialized after he started campaigning and the case was suddenly dropped just before election day.</p>
<p>Nobody has ever seen the accuser, who appears to be closely associated with a former producer for <em>The Jerry Springer Show</em>.</p>

        <p><p>Okay, well go file a 100 million dollar lawsuit against Podesta and maybe then they will cover it. Because the lawsuit is why it got attention, not because it had merit. Right now, pizzagate only exists on the internet and they have no reason to cover it. Take it to the real world and see what happens. </p>
<p>Apparently, you don't even have to have a lawyer to file a lawsuit...</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah. I mean, I know most people looking into this are Trump supporters, but he really deserves to be looked at with scrutiny too. He was close friends with not only the Clintons but also Jeffrey Epstein in the past, and, like you said, has underage rape allegations. If people are suspicious of Obama for what could possibly be a large order of specialty hot dogs, they really need to look more closely at Trump. </p></p>

        <p><p>To be fair, we just went through an 18 month election cycle. Trump is one of the most vilified candidates of all time. The elites, the MSM, the public, the guy down at the laundromat, and the pope tried to take him down. If there was deep dirt, I have to imagine it would've been leaked by now. I'm not saying that I'm not skeptical as well, but I do think the vetting process he went through and made it out clean is a good start.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, I get it. I've seen the insane media bias, I know the resources Clinton has. Heck, I bet she had that "pussy" tape on him for months before she had it strategically released on the same day wikileaks started leaking the emails.*</p>
<p>But this stuff with Alefantis and all the other related things has been going on right in from of everyone's faces for years. I mean, they had a fucking pedophile symbol on their logo and creepy pictures of kids on their public instagram. Yet the only reason anyone started looking into it was because people were scouring through Podesta's emails. The elites have got each other's backs on this, they're not going to expose each other, it's up to regular folks.</p>
<p>I know people are quick to dismiss negative stuff about Trump, and understandably so, because of all the bs the media has spun. But there's a good explanation why, if there is serious dirt on him, that Clinton wouldn't have wanted to dig it up. It would make people look at her more closely and find exactly the stuff we're finding now. So of course she'd keep quiet about it.</p>
<p>I'm not accusing Trump of anything yet, I'm just suggesting that because of his connections and history, that maybe it's worth looking into.</p>

        <p><p>He's one of the names in Epstein "little black book" and they've hung out at each other's residences. It doesn't prove he's done anything, but they are familiar with each other. It's enough to warrant a look. If he's innocent, then nobody will find anything, right? No harm in checking it out though.</p></p>

        <p><p>Start happening again?  It never stopped happening.
And I don't think Trump is in on this.  I think part of the reason he ran is because he knows whats up and is going to stop this shit.  They tried to get to him and that failed.  They tried to falsely accused him and he told them to fuck off.  Now he is the president and they are shitting their pants.  </p>
<p>I hope...</p></p>

        <p><p>That's what political parties do though. He wasn't involved with the sex ring because he opposed Clinton in 2008 and won. If they were connected, that never would've happened. That's why they rigged the election this time, they couldn't have an outsider fucking it up. Clinton even got Trump the nod on the Republican side (look it up) so that no matter what somebody in their gang would be in power this time. Jesus, wake up, it's all around you. </p></p>

        <p><p>You tell me to wake up but your focus is way too narrow. Clinton was stopped in 08 so that they could usher in a black president to further the racial divisions in America that would eventually, when stoked enough and backed by SJW sheep that were molded by the press, lead to civil war. This civil war would then be an easy in for the globalists to move in and take over America. </p>
<p>Clinton vs Obama in 08 had NOTHING to do with who was in the pedophile ring and who wasn't. That canvas is much bigger. She stayed in until the end because it was part of the show, to set her up for this election season. Shit backfired. That's why they are scrambling right now to continue to run Trump and his burgeoning administration down in the press, paying these people to protest and doxxing electors and making threats against them to change their vote. They are still desperate to either get Hillary in there by hook or by crook or start their civil war via protest riots. </p>
<p>And Clinton did use the media to give Trump the nod, but that was because she thought he would be a guaranteed victory over someone like say a Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio. And if the Bushes are balls deep (pardon the pun) in this whole thing, why not push Jeb out there as her opponent for the same reason you state? They would obviously have a deeper history than the Clintons and Trump.  </p>
<p>And they rigged the primary against Bernie because he wasn't going to do what the globalists wanted. The world does not revolve around this pedophile ring, bruh. </p></p>

        <p><p>Ah, but that's where it gets tricky. Clinton was heavily involved in getting Trump through the Republican primary. They were working together, and just trying to make sure one of them one. The fact that Obama defeated Clinton in the primary could very well suggest that he wasn't involved.</p></p>

        <p><p>Even at $1 per hotdog (which is pretty damn pricey, especially when buying in volume) that would be 65,000 hotdogs. How many grills would you need for that cookout? How many tons of charcoal? How much lighter fluid? :-)</p></p>

        <p><p>Supposedly the FBI has it in spades, and they're looking for a venue for legal action. The argument is that this stuff is so pervasive in government agencies, that essentially any one who could prosecute is complicit or doesn't want to be suicided. </p>
<p>Supposedly, that's the word on the street, but from a lot of people: https://youtu.be/DFZRQcSMeeM

        <p><p>Honestly, Reddit is starting to concern me lately. This type of thinking and mob mentality seems to have amplified after the election. It was clearly here before, but it seems more pervasive now and a lot more up voted and supported. Just yesterday someone tried to argue that a person saying "the Holocaust happened" was evidence of the Holocaust happening (obviously it happened but that's not proof). </p></p>

        <p><p>Wait, are we taking the word of Cathy O'Brien? The same Cathy O'Brien who's married to Mark Phillips and accused of brainwashing Shaela Miller?</p>
<p>This same Cathy O'Brien?</p>

<p>Beyond herself actually being, potentially, an accomplice to corruption of a minor herself. The story she tells doesn't line up with MK-Ultra's timeline, or even the Clinton's, imo.</p>
<p>I've always been highly skeptical of the MKUltra people, because there's literally no way to prove or disprove what they're saying, due to the nature of which the experiment's records were destroyed. Especially when they have books to sell you, media appearances to get and other various bullshit to make money off you.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't know. I honestly do not know what to think. In the video when she's asked, "was there a lot of bleeding," she went blank like she had no idea... typically I would say that's evidence that's she making it up, but in this case, if she were as dissociative as she claims, maybe she wouldn't have been aware?</p>
<p>That said, if that's the case, wouldn't her memories and claims be HIGHLY manipulatable? We all know, the healthiest of us can have shaped and outright false recall. </p>
<p>IDK what to think about this, except to not draw conclusions</p></p>

        <p><p>Is it reasonable to suspect that she is faking it? I get that a lot of the stuff here was "unbelievable" a month ago, but the idea she is faking it and waiting for this moment for it to be relevant is so insanely improbable it eclipses the entire pizzagate theory entirely.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, I'd say a woman accurately predicting the future based on zero information at the time is more unlikely than several high ranking officials working together to fuck kids as a unit.</p>
<p>Were you every part of a fraternity or another type of group like that? I have been, and admittedly we did not take it very seriously. But when it came to some of the higher up members it was apparent this was something very real and very serious to them. </p>
<p>To me, this is much easier to believe than a person channeling Nostradamus like this.</p></p>

        <p><p>Right, the odds would be heavily weighted on the crazy chick side , if the giant ring of elite pedophiles hadn't ever happened before and if there was only one crazy chick. </p>
<p>Catholic Church? </p></p>

        <p><p>As far as I'm aware most of the instances of abuse within the Catholic Church involved individuals molesting children in isolation and then being insufficiently punished by church authorities after the fact. Also, many of them were rank-and-file priests, not powerful officials. Anyways, the main point is that there wasn't any sort of well-developed coordination of pedophiliac activities amongst officials, which is what you're alleging the DNC elite did.</p>
<p>That takes care of the first bit I think. So, who are the other crazy chicks?</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, def doesn't make it impossible. People do crazy things.</p>
<p>Basically, either way you look at it is just as crazy.</p>
<p>Did she do it to herself and found just the right moment and conspiracy to bubble up for it to be relevant?</p>
<p>Or is what she is saying true?</p>
<p>Both are pretty much the same level of insane. I would like to find out more about her gyno and see if she is a real dr...Anyone got her name?</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't think they're the same level of insane at all - self mutilation is definitely a thing. If she was in a psychotic episode, she could definitely have been capable of doing it herself. In my opinion, connecting it to HRC is a reach. This subreddit is pretty full of confirmation bias.</p></p>

        <p><p>A lot of this sub is full of confirmation bias, especially as it grows bigger. </p>
<p>The connection isn't a reach considering she directly accused HRC for all this. I do, however, think it would be damaging to our cause to blindly believe this without solid evidence. At the same time, it is important to make note of these things in case it makes a connection or is confirmed somewhere else later on.</p></p>

        <p><p>I did not say it was "proof." I said it demanded an explanation. The explanation that it was inflicted upon her is more plausible, given the cumulative evidence, than the explanation that it was self-inflicted. </p></p>

        <p><p>I understand what you write and what you said. I'm not questioning YOU, I'm just giving my opinion. It certainly looks odd (her vagina) but who the fuck knows. So much stuff going on. I do sincerely hope that 'something' undisputable comes up and blows the whole thing WIDE open. Seems all too often that when these matters are exposed (like Jimmy Saville) they're dead or on their way out anyway. I know that there was talk of slowly drip-feeding information (in the Saville case) so that by the time it all came out, these old fucking paedos are dead. </p></p>

        <p><p>Most people in her position never do. It's a lost cause because the court system is full of these people as well. Also you have a much better chance of living if you don't persue that avenue.</p>
<p>Another point i want to make is that people with DID are often dismissed without consideration of their testimony because the disorder is so misunderstood and purposely discredited.</p></p>

        <p><p>Wake up you fool, they're all involved. Hillary is just a pawn. There might not be a single president for decades that was part of this! Trump and the Clintons used to be best friends. This election was all lies to throw us off the trail. The evidence is fucking insurmountable! </p></p>

        <p><p>No, they're all involved. This isn't about your love for Trump, it's about exposing the truth. Go call someone retarded in /r/politics, this transcends this pathetic election cycle and its two loser scumbag candidates. Wake up fools! </p></p>

<p>you think you're slick lol. it's incredibly transparent which is why everyone is downvoting you. so between you can i, you gotta step it up. i respect the art of the con, i  respect some clever psyops. but you're neither of those. so read up a little, perfect your shit, and come back on a new name and give it another go. i got faith in you.</p></p>

        <p><p>Haha typical Trump shill tactics. Call everyone trolls when you run out of arguments. </p>
<p>I'm being downvoted because this place is a hotbed of political shills. You're one of them. </p>
<p>Prove me wrong or shut up. Oh wait, you can't. Because there's no hard evidence supporting any of these people fucking kids. </p>
<p>All we have is circumstantial evidence which points wherever we want it to. My arguments are equally if not more valid than yours. </p>
<p>Nice try though! </p>
<p>Edit: lol one look through your post history shows you don't care about pizzagate at all. You're just anti-clinton, as if your name wasn't proof enough. </p>
<p>Get out of here loser, adults are talking. </p></p>

        <p><p>see my previous message, you think you're clever but it's laughable. you've been entirely unable to provoke an emotional response in me, it's more like 'sigh, this idiot keeps responding to me.'</p>
<p>i'm serious, trolling is a art, you can't just pick it up from party narratives. you need to learn how to bite into your opponent, really let them know how much of a tool they are. you already know how much of a tool you are so i don't need to reinforce it. but you get my point.</p></p>

        <p><p>That's your problem, you say I'm bad at trolling, which would be true if that's what I were doing. </p>
<p>Unfortunately this is a real situation, and you're distracting people from searching for the truth. </p>
<p>Stop pushing politics into this sub, it's not about Trump vs. Clinton!</p>
<p>Also, if you're so "yawn" above this, why do you keep trying to get a rise out of me? </p>
<p>You are the troll, and trolling had no place in a child rape investigation. I suggest you leave this sub if you only plan to troll its members. </p></p>

        <p><p>Ok in the interests of scepticism we now have evidence that her vagina is scarred. To be honest I was expecting more, a pentagram or goats head carving but it's definitely something there that isn't naturally occouring.</p>
<p>The obvious alternative explanation is that she did it to herself. Self mutilation is relatively common so it's not that outlandish a claim. Women self harm for attention and to back up lies all the time. But that explanation doesn't really hold up in light of her other claims. There is no upside or benefit for her to make these claims if he was lying. Especially since it's obvious that she's not being believed, continuing to maintain a story after it's failed doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Personally I still don't believe this 100%, but it's getting pretty close to half and half.</p>
<p>I also want off this wild ride. I understand why Cypher wanted to be plugged back in.</p></p>

        <p><p>You missed the third option: she's delusional and really believes that someone else did it to her. I know that the term "delusional" is thrown around to discredit people, but it's still a real possibility to take into account, as an alternative to lying.</p></p>

        <p><p>And not surprisingly; This ALL goes beyond just the Clintons and that administration too, much of this came about during the Reagan and Bush years  and being initiated about during the Ford administration (according to <a href="http://whale.to/b/brien2.html">O'Brien</a>'s Trance Formation of America <a href="https://archive.org/stream/TranceformationOfAmerica/tranceformation_america_djvu.txt">book</a>) like with the Boys Town of Nebraska scandal (as mentioned in the Conspiracy of Silence banned <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttT6FrMosBk">documentary</a>) and that mutually involved <a href="http://www.franklincase.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11&amp;Itemid=9">Franklin</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_child_prostitution_ring_allegations">Case</a> child <a href="http://www.salem-news.com/articles/december292012/boys-town-scandal-tk.php">prostitution</a> ring <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/2mc78d/what_really_happened_in_boys_town_and_larry_king/">scandal</a> that started as far back as the post-JFK <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/proutyJFKmurderandLyndonJohnson.shtml">coup d'etat</a> of <a href="http://www.prouty.org/johnson.html">1963</a>.

        <p><p>Question, what are the possibilities that she is not mentally ill and she did it to herself.</p>
<p>I am all for her, but we also need to cover every topic that can discredit these claims. If we leave any kind of opening for people to dig a dagger into, it will destroy the whole being through that one hole in the armor of evidence. </p></p>

        <p><p>I'm honestly pretty disgusted at a lot of comments here. Granted this thread is being hit by lots of shills and that's par for the course, but this condescending, trivial laughing off of the whole phenomenon of ritual abuse is illogical and small minded.</p>
<p>It's arrogant indeed if you think you KNOW this doesn't happen so either it requires arrogance or the apathy necessary to keep making victims pay for trying to speak out.</p>
<p>It's amazing how much i see "if it was real people would talk" in the same breath as laughter in the face of someone who tries to.</p></p>

        <p><p>It wasn't called that for a joke, but because this is all steming from comet pin pong, the pizza place. People are realising now it probably shouldn't have been called that as you're correct with what you're saying, butbto move subreddits now would possibly be detrimental and just hindering progress.</p></p>

        <p><p>Have you guys heard of the "papa kills babies" videos, and the resulting investigation? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7_epvNbaPQ">These</a> kids talk about their teachers and leaders around the town fuck them and make them participate in satanic rituals, notably among them is eating babies. The kids recanted later, after testifying, though when a doctor examined their bodies/genitals to see if the abuse they told of was true, there was the same scarring that the kids said was there. There's hours of their interrogation on youtube. </p></p>

<p>Either all of these people are crazy and lying and we are all imagining things and a child sliced her own vagina, OR the Clintons and their associates are indeed involved in child ritual abuse and trafficking.</p>

<p>No, it's not either-or - you guys discredit yourself with this type of simplicity. </p></p>

        <p><p>Ya know about 2 hours before the Oct 9th debate, I received a phone call from someone that just got off the phone with Roger Stone. Stone and Trump wanted Cathy O'Briens phone #. I passed along the info. But personally I'm not sold on O'Briens story, I interviewed her two hours , spent about another 20 minutes off the air and I do not find them very credible. You can find my interview on Youtube or iTunes, Spreaker. </p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>In her 1995 Trance Formation of America publication, O'Brien states George H. W. Bush and Miguel de la Madrid used holograms to appear in altered forms, "Bush apparently activated a hologram of the lizard-like "alien" which provided the illusion of Bush transforming like a chameleon before my eyes. In retrospect, I understand that Bush had been painstakingly careful in positioning our seats in order that the hologram's effectiveness be maximized."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She's a nut, and has been for a long time. Being cut up isn't the only claim she makes. For decades she's claimed to have been in all sorts of secret government projects. Right, like they keep choosing her for everything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O'Brien also states that she has a recollection of child abuse — of her and her daughter — by international pedophile rings, drug barons and satanists, as part of a sex slave aspect to her "trauma based mind control programming." Individuals from United States, Canadian, Mexican and Saudi Arabian government officials to stars of the COUNTRY AND WESTERN music scene are among those she accuses of these crimes. According to scholar Michael Barkun, investigations into the story produced no credible evidence and numerous inconsistencies."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If she were talking about UFO's everyone would be treating her as they should. But now that HRC has this huge conspiracy thing going, even the most inconsequential of sources become wasteful sinks.</p></p>

        <p><p>I believe Cathy is being mind controlled in a way, but not in the way she is describing. While she very well may have been abused as a child, her husband, Mark Phillips, then exploited those experiences and is the one who is planting these idea's in her head.  And she's not the only one. Shaela Miller moved in with Cathy and Mark for a job and then eventually cut off contact with a family she was close with, and is now making widely inflammatory accusations against her family and past. </p>
<p>Mark is "ex" CIA with experience in mind control (don't have much info on this at the moment) and a google of his name will demonstrate he's not the best character.</p>
<p><a href="https://millerfamilyblogging.wordpress.com/">Here is a link to a blog created by Shaela Miller's family giving their side of the story. It's heartbreaking.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://millerfamilyblogging.wordpress.com/about/">And more</a></p>
<p>[Here is an interview video with Mark Phillips, Cathy O'brien and Shaela Miller.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nir9mOWkj5c)  You can see how disjointed Shaela speaks now (according to friends and family she doesn't sound like herself at all anymore) and how Mark has to feed her details for her supposed own experiences.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIUy2DtxmnA">Miller family response to the interview above</a></p>
<p>I believe both Cathy O'Brien and Shaela Miller need to get the hell away from Mark because he is the abuser in this situation.</p></p>

        <p><p>No wonder Trump hates Roseanne so much. She's onto the child sex ring that he, his buddies the Clintons, and many others are a part of. They tried to distract us with this divisive campaign. They didn't think we'd start connecting the dots. Roseanne was right all along. </p></p>

        <p><p>Oh really? Something untrue is obvious to everyone here? I'm shilling for Soros? </p>
<p>Soros is a scumbag and a criminal and needs to be imprisoned. The Clintons, Trump, Podesta, Putin, all of them are criminals. I shill for no one, I seek the truth. </p>
<p>Nice try though, Trump spammer! </p></p>

        <p><p>No. Just stop. If you splash in a puddle, soon the water becomes murky and you can't see through it. If you stand still, and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait, and eventually the sediment settles and the water becomes clear. So it it it is with your mind.</p>
<p>Take a walk, and think of nothing but the next step, and wait for your thoughts (of things you can't control but for letting them upset you) ... wait for them to settle and wait for your mind to become clear. </p>
<p>It can't hurt and can only help.</p></p>

        <p><p>People use it all the time outside of the alt-right safe space. This isn't about your politics, it's about the truth. Leave if you're just here to smear Clinton. We don't need you to, she's doing it to herself because the facts will speak for themselves. You're pathetic, using child rape for political gain. Nobody uses cuck anymore either, the liberals started saying it. </p>
