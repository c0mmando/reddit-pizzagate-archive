    Antonin Scalia murdered to cover up pedophilia ring

    This article written on August 24th of 2016 continues to ring true more and more everyday.
   </p>
   <p>
    First things first Antonin Scalia was murdered. Believe what you'd like but that's the truth.
   </p>
   <p>
    https://wikileaks.com/podesta-emails/emailid/1459)
   </p>
   <p>
    This is a seemingly harmless email sent to John Podesta and former Gov. of New York Pataki. The gist of the email is that this person has a movie proposition for Podesta. He has a script a budget and a producer but funding is needed. John Podesta would be in charge of selecting content and pick a producer. This movie is based in Mexican American war times. The person proposing this movie says it'll be a 2016 political game changer and eludes to it paving the way for economic growth a kin to when the iron curtain came down. A map is provided for the proposed filming location. They use an obscure smithsonian link here www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/lesson_plans/borders/map1a.html
   </p>
   <p>
    Now here's where the problems are. John Podesta has zero movie experience, never produced or funded any movie before. So it's odd in the first place that this person is candidly propositioning him via email for what one can only assume would be at least 1.5 million as they claim they have estimated for a base budget in the email. Strange to ask for that over email. 
If this is going to be a political game changer for 2016 then why are you getting in touch with someone to start talks of production in November of 2015? That's a little less than a year for you to get organized film edit produce market and distribute a movie AND have it have a significant political effect before the election. Just seems like very very odd timing if this was a serious venture. 
Now this movie is supposed to spur on some kind of economic boom? Jesus Christ just what is in the rest of this script it must be the most amazing movie ever made! 
The most disturbing part of this whole email is the smithsonian map. This email is sent November of 2015 with that map included. If you'll notice the location of the little marker the bottom left of the Texas Mexico border. 
3 months later Antonin Scalia would be found dead at Cibolo Creek Ranch located here with a zoomed in shot of the Smithsonian map underneath

    Now you are free to make whatever assumption you want but here are the facts. John Podesta received a very strange email about a movie in November 2015. The filming location for this movie is described using a very obscure and very specific map that you have to actively seek out as it will not show up in google because it is behind a membership wall. This very specific map happens to have a marker on it directly pointing to the location of the Cibolo Creek Ranch where Antonin Scalia would be found dead the following February.
   </p>
   <p>
    All the language in the email could very well be made out to be mechanic language.

    If you read the first article you'll see the angle introduced that Antonin Scalia was the final protector for the pedophile ring. He was their safeguard on the highest court in the land. The article claims that Obama was black mailing Scalia with evidence of his involvement in the ring and that his friends on the inside killed him over this. I'm not sure I'm fully confident in that theory. However It's possible that Obama and his Cartel of controllers/investors/donors (whatever you want to call them) saw Scalia as a possible obstacle in the way of the US signing the TPP. Who knows if it would have ever come to the Supreme Court but I think if it had passed it would have been fought so hard that it would have made it there. The TPP encompasses 40% of the worlds GDP. That's an insane amount of money to be fucking with and TPTB did not want to risk it being destroyed by a single old man and they decide they want him out, confident that their plan to put a President of their choice in power will succeed (top kek) they order that same future president to get it done as she will be able to protect her own people. So Podesta sets it up. The hit is complete and it's all honked dorey. But it's not that simple when you are fucking with 40% OF THE WORLDS GDP. There's gonna be a lot of salty people. It was at this point (all speculation here) that those salty people (other shadow gov, globalist power at be etc) saw what the Clinton Soros Cartel was up to and tried to pull the ole Trump switcheroo doing everything they could to quietly support trumps run for the White House. What I think really seals the deal on this theory is that the very next day after Trump won the TPP was dead. It's like they don't even care how it looks. These are just my thoughts based on the facts and what we know. Hope I'm not rambling but let me know what you think

    I think you've got your two conspiracies mixed here.
   </p>
   <p>
    The global elite, headed by Soros, would have wanted Scalia out of the way and preferably a more controlled justice on the bench.
   </p>
   <p>
    The pedo elite probably have little connection with Scalia, but I wouldn't doubt he knew too much.  That's likely why they let him decide the 2000 election, because he knew too much. Not ones to risk, they removed him so the SCOTUS could not pull a 2000 on them.  Scalia died and no autopsy was done no questions were asked... it's just accepted he died.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yeah I think there's shit going on here, Scalia is tied in but as an outsider forced to work with these sick motherfuckers.

     Well to be fair if you read my post all the way through I do say that there's little evidence in my mind to support the black mail pedophilia story and that's why I offered up my alternative. Not getting them mixed just trying to illustrate the point that we have literally evidence of a Supreme Court justice being murdered for globalist corporate personal gain and no one is doing anything about it. Like it's right here in front of us.

    Here's the problem.  You are quoting VT, which is a known disinfo site.  The head of the site has even admitted in the past that 50% of this stories are completely fake, and supposedly that is the reason why he's still alive...frankly I don't trust diddly with VT.  Can you name a single story they've ever printed that was freaking true?
   </p>
   <p>
    In the 10+ years of their existence?  I certainly haven't...

    Any conspiracy that finds Scalia on the side of truth and justice is already unbelievable

     And that's the exact problem, you didn't even read the post because if you had you would realize that he is in no way on the side of truth or justice.
