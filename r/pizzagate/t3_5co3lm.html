<strong>Please be very careful, stay aware of things around you.</strong>
<p><p>My friend noticed someone trailing them today, their girlfriend noticed as well. They have been posting on here.</p>
<p>Please stay aware of your surroundings. This person made deliberate eye contact and obviously trailed them. They were threatening in manner. (And this is not to discourage anyone. I want people to continue researching, just be aware of the danger. To think there isn't any danger connected to this would be naive considering the people involved.)</p></p>

<p><p>I call bullshit.   Posts like this are designed to discourage people from getting involved.   There are literally millions of people aware of pizzagate.   No one is going to stalk you for posting on a message board.   </p></p>

<p><p>Yup. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cnvld/im_freaking_the_fuck_out_right_now_and_i_dont/?st=ivg2ytok&amp;sh=7e949359">OP sounds very similar to this other thread made an hour ago</a>.</p>
<p>OP's account is less than 24 hours old. I doubt like hell that the opposition managed to track down their home address, assemble a team, and stalk them in that time frame. It's not like there's anything particularly incriminating in OP's comment history that would provoke such a strong response.</p>
<p>These are scare tactics, folks. Don't fall for it.</p></p>

<p><p>OP's account is less than 24 hrs old because OP was making posts on personal account then thought to make a throwaway.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to use scare tactics at all but it's important to be aware shit like this can happen.</p></p>

<p><p>You clearly didn't read my post.</p>
<p>My post was about my friends, not me. You questioned why I had a new account so I explained why. They aren't posting on pizzagate anymore because of the incident so I made this post for them.</p></p>

<p><p>Also, I thought that post was fake too. It was illogical they couldn't call the cops or just take a photo of the license plate. That was obviously someone just trying to make people scared or maybe just trolling for laughs.</p>
<p>I'm not doing that. I'm not claiming someone is trying to tear down my door or something. It's not scare tactics, it was a real event. Whether it was because of pizzagate or maybe the guy was just being creepy for no reason, the timing was odd. Perhaps it was just a coincidence.</p></p>

<p><p>Sorry but it is not bullshit.</p>
<p>The people in question live near DC, so that might be why. Someone living in Cali or another country I would be skeptical. But, living close by, maybe that is why these people would more easily be able to get to them.</p>
<p>Edit: Also the last thing I want is for people to not get involved, but it is important to remember what kind of thing this is. It isn't just the Clintons, or the Podestas, ect. It isn't even just Comet Pizza. It is a huge spiderweb of powerful people and they have pretty much unlimited resources to spend on keeping this quiet. Everyone please continue researching, just remain aware of the danger.</p></p>

<p><p>What is up with the down voting? You guys are so quick to label someone as just trolling. I have doing research since this picked up, this is my throwaway account cause I was researching on my personal account. It's hurtful that I make a post about this, and automatically people assume I am a shill.</p>
<p>I even said that I do want people involved and I don't want to discourage anyone. I just want people to be aware, because there -are- dangers to this.</p>
<p>I mean, have you even considered that I might be telling the truth?? Maybe they misinterpreted it, maybe they were paranoid. Maybe the guy was just being creepy for some other reason. But I have no reason to lie or spread misinformation. I'm happy that people are researching this and at how fast connections are being discovered.</p></p>

<p><p>It's important not to get overly paranoid that it starts to effect your life off the Internet.</p>
<p>Just sounds like paranoia, which makes sense. I'd imagine most people feel like they've stumbled upon something they weren't supposed to find when first reading into this.</p></p>
