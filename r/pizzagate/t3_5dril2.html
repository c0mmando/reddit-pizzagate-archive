        <p><p>wayyyyy too abstract and out of context,
if you are saying the entire thing is occult/religion driven, it's not
it's simply a power structure of different intent
1.) money laundering
2.) lust/pedophilia 
3.) occult
4.) leverage</p></p>

        <p><p>You know I'm actually just saying keep your eyes open to notice coincidences, as I think artists subconsciously channel and express prophecies in metaphor when they don't even realize it. Now that I know what to look for I see this sort of thing happening all the time. My sixth sense was alerted to look for symbolic connections between this film and current events. I am not saying the filmmakers were in on the conspiracy. But I am saying I think that aspects of the case, including the rituals involved, may be an expression of the same Crowleyan current that we see represented in this film.</p></p>
