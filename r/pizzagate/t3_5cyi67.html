        <strong>QUESTION: Where did the code words glossary originate? Is it just that anonymous 4chan post or is there something more?</strong>

        <p><p>I used to think it was a term coined by 4chan pedophiles, but nowadays, I'm not so sure. I doubt [they] would adopt something made up by precisely whom they hate, so I reckon the anon(s) who introduced the term to the imageboard vernacular in the first place all those years ago, considering the prevalence of illegal child porn early on, are or were a part of this conspiracy and used a term that was familiar to them, unwittingly uncovering the first fold of one of, if not THE most tightly covered conspiratorial fabric in history. We adopted it as slang without realizing it's true meaning.</p></p>

        <p><p>And nobody responds. Everyone's proof is "its well-known". But I have no idea why.</p></p>
