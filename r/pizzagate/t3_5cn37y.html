<strong>Keep Your Wits</strong>
<p><p>I've been watching, reading, and archiving.</p>
<p>The progression in some of us as investigators and activists against pizzagate is declining.
Some of us are starting to sound like we're losing our minds with a sense of urgency in everything we post, some of us are not carrying ourselves the right way.</p>
<p>We need to stay calm and collected while we investigate and question everything. Please, keep your cool. Panicking will do nothing but hurt us. Let us refrain from witch hunting without proof and keep this sub (as well as ourselves) alive.</p></p>
