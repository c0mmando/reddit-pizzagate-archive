        <p><p>I saw someone post the info on Monica petersen on 4chan as well, seems like they keep glossing over relevant info. I just lurk the chans so I don't get involved over there, just seems like everyone is doing all this digging but there's nothing we can do with it.</p></p>

        <p><p>the only way we can do anything about it is if we have a picture straight up incriminating. </p>
<p>until then we can only connect the dots, stack up substantial evidence and hopefully fbi is watching for info</p></p>

        <p><p>My only concern is that the FBI is already privy to this and that high level players are potentially not only privy but involved. I really hope someone digs into something that is straight up incriminating but I can't help but feel it and the person/people who uncover it will mysteriously "disappear".</p></p>

        <p><p>good things going is : trump/whoeever ag is/more leaks coming.</p>
<p>meantime, finding as much as we can is still good
the whole fact pizzagate exists makes the public aware, and pressure on authority to close cases, not everyone is bad, the good ones will stepup. That in itself, makes pizzagate a successful movement </p></p>

        <p><p>As far as the leaks go, I'm not entirely sure the Wikileaks hasn't been compromised at this point, I'm not even normally a conspiracy person however recently so may shady things have been happening that I can't help but feel there's more than meets the eye with damn near everything that's being suspected at the moment. With no proof of life from Assange and what appears to be filtered leaks and no phase 3 from Wl is very concerning. I really hope it's not true and we continue to receive good leaks and that Trump follows through on the investigations but you could say my confidence level isn't the highest it's ever been.</p></p>

        <p><p>Wikileaks was infiltrated about 6 years ago, shortly after they released those Afghan War docs. Female CIA spooks running around their office, luring Assange to blackmail/compromise parties, etc.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah I wasn't trying to imply that the entirety of the FBI is compromised but there is the possibility that key players are, there are always going to be those that are for the people that are there to stop corruption but how are we supposed to know who that is?</p></p>

        <p><p>This is what has been happening for years, loads of investigators and witnesses have died or committed suicide and the FBI and police have often helped cover up. Hard to imagine true justice happening.</p></p>

        <p><p>Another link to art gallery's / art and possible dot to connect. The Hemphill Art gallery is on the list of clients for Kaze Design. The Director of Hemphill Fine Arts Gallery is all over Jimmy Comets' IG (mary early). She was also one of the positive reviewers on Comet PP's FB after this blew up. She is ALSO a sculptor who's name appears in the same stories w/ Tony Podesta who is  also an art lover. No smoking gun but another connection perhaps...</p></p>

        <p><p>Note also Transformer is on the list.  Based 4Chan Anon posted this earlier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"http://washingtonlife.com/2012/03/15/paint-the-town-best-loved-art/</p>
<p>According to the article, James Alefantis played this movie in full out the window of the Transformer art gallery after it was banned by the Smithsonian. Watch the last five minutes, it's vintage Comet Pizza child abuse and sacrifice.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHRCwQeKCuo"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which ends up tying into these breadcrumbs Alefantis left for us, from a reddit thread from over the weekend:

        <p><p>I think comet pizza may be a distraction , or ag least the front. It is wayyy to overt. Besta pizza though seems to me that they may be more suspicious . They quickly changed their pedo symbol logo . I was looking to see who made their logo in hopes of asking the designer how they came up with the logo, and if a specific symbol was given to them and by who ? I found this strange site called zeroflux.com an internet publishing company . They are also known as virtual reality Inc. and share the same domain as telusllc.com which is registered to Allen Raymond who wrote a book called how to rig an election in 2008. Virtual reality Inc/zeroflux at first glance appears to be a gun shooting NRA type of magazine/organization for gun enthusiasts. But on there website and upon further inspection of company they provide a variety of services for their clients, and are often shareholders in their clients businesses.  Under their logos there are strange logos/companies that appear to me to be fronts. They have a cafe press shop linked on their webpage that sells merchandise for these sites, and there are also flicker galleries of pictures in the gallery section of the website. Though a few of these sites just take you straight to zeroflux.com when you click on them. So while you can go to the gallery and see photos associated with these websites, and the cafe press shop has merchandise associated with these websites, when you actually try to visit the websites themselves it only takes you back to the zeroflux.com page.  Now a few of these websites are qoffa.com a supposed beach products company which has no actual site , and also a catsenate website, which says its all aboit cats in the senate, and tho catsenate.com just takes you to zeroflux.com, it has products in the store and it has a gallery of clandestine pictures of cats. Then there is there is serresbay.com which actually exists but is just a bunch of pictures of Legos and has a user login. Then there's Capitol grilling . Com (the political parlor game) which is a japanese blog I translated to English and talks about a conversation somewhat like the Italian recording. Also the zeroflux.com has a documents area that you have to login too.  On a reverse ip search I found 5 sites that were international banks under this ip. I dont know whats up with it but something seems fishy about it, like it's got these brands that are fronts and are queer. You can also look in their archives and discover more of their projects in the past ten years that are equally ominous companies and websites.. could be nothing but I only looked into it because they provide logo for besta pizza and seem to have a vested interest in all their, seemingly odd, clients, albeit I did find a few that looked legit.  But the more I get into this investigation the more im seeing these "internet companies" that offer a wide range of internet services and they all seem to be from around the same area, Virginia, Maryland, DC.   Dont make me take off my tinfoil hat. </p></p>

        <p><p>Those designers only need to work for one or a few guys in those teams, and these guys take care of all the PAC and friend related designs.</p>
<p>For example, a lot of starting NGOs are poor. But the pizza people need to get those NGOs approved to get some founding so they can be sent in the area of "business". So to make this happen faster, a Podesta will tell the naive NGO "I'll take care of the designs and prints". This way, the NGO gets nice marketing material to present and looks more professional than it really is. That's why that designer touched to so many different projects.</p>
<p>The designer could have no personal in interest in any of these businesses.</p>
<hr>
<p>A: Check keywords in source code... :-)</p>

<p>Look at the designs on the slide. I'm surprised no one jumped at the "pedo bear". Could be an innocent teddy bear too.</p>
<p>But more interesting, the "Friend of Virgin Islands" invitation...</p>
<p>Here's what they do:</p>
<p>http://www.friendsvinp.org/about-us/major-accomplishments</p>
<p>What's interesting: That design project is really outside the scope of what the designer seems to do. Also, Epstein's island is there and most likely donated to VI causes:</p>
<p>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/13/jeffrey-epstein-donations-us-virgin-islands-review</p>
<p>Edit: Also may be related to TerraMar (Ghislaine) since they have sea conservation projects as well.</p></p>
