        <p><p>Has anyone seen if there's a connection there? The defendant, the judge, any odd surrounds on the case years ago?</p></p>

        <p><p>At the very least it shows how comfortable she is surrounding herself with pedophilia.</p></p>

        <p><p>Another thing I'm thinking about while at work. I'm thinking that the Clinton Fondation is used for laundering the money. With this in mind, I was reminded of the Panama papers thing. Not sure if there's any value in there but I would think it's worth a look. </p>
<p>My thinking is that the foundation is used to launder the money. The pizza place is just a front. Kind of like how the mob would have a store that'd people would go buy stuff at. If you were the right person, you'd ask for bread and get an AK (something along those lines).</p>
<p>Once I get home I'll be able to do some more digging. </p>

        <p><p>I wondered if this case was what got her into this dark world in the first place. Perhaps this is how she got tapped.</p></p>

        <p><p>Like if the guy got in her head?</p>
<p>Sheesh, planet altering meeting if so.  I prefer to think she was already gone.</p></p>
