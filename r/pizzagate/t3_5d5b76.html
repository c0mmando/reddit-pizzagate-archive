<strong>Looks like Comet Ping Pong has asked all their friends to leave positive Facebook reviews.</strong>
<p><p>See how many 5* reviews people are writing on the page right now? Several of those folks are friends of the owner. There are a ton of people leaving reviews and several of them mock Pizzagate calling us "crazy alt-right conspiracy theorists". Also check out Heavy Breathing's Facebook, as they have been responding to comments on their latest posts.</p></p>

<p><p>With your i ment this sub. And how is it shilling? Its pretty obvious that these comments are more fake than the one of their actual customers. Especially as so many of them talk about satanism, occult, cannibalism and other bullshit like this that has no relation with this at all.</p></p>

<p><p>imagine if you were just an average joe that go to comet pizza to grab a slice of pizza every now and then. it would sound preposterous for anyone to say that the 'nice' owner is a pedo fuck. they would have to spend some time to do some deep down research...that we know many will never do.  </p></p>

<p><p>Whoever is posting this "Owner is a pedophile, Satanist &amp; cannibal! Children are raped and ritualistically slaughtered. The remains are used in the food they serve!" Needs to calm down.</p>
<p>Saying Satanist, cannibal, kids are being ritualistically slaughtered, and used in food makes us sound fucking insane. If you didn't know about this whole thing and read that, would you believe us or tell us to go put on a tin foil hat?</p>
<p>Instead of spouting seemingly crazy nonsense, say something constructive and provide sources where people can make up their own minds. Something like "Please take a look at reddit.com/r/pizzagate and keep and open mind to what I'm saying. The owner is accused of pedophilia and we want to find out the truth if children's lives are at risk."</p>
<p>Seriously, between the two, which would you dismiss as insane and which would you think twice about?</p></p>

<p><p>Pleasedon't: Here's the reason this happens.</p>
<p>Just by the very nature of the fact that this is LITERALLY a conspiracy theory (that I believe is 100% true) means that this will attract legitimately eccentric tin-foilers to our 'cause'.</p>
<p>So we have to do exactly what you do, pleasedont. Explain why it's not helpful. The tinfoilers are like The_Donald's Autists. We can weaponize them, but they need to know how to navigate socially.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah, I guess it is just something we will be seeing more and more of as we get more traction. </p>
<p>The most frustrating part to me is I don't know if these guys have good intentions, are crazy tin-foilers, or people deliberately trying to hurt our cause...</p></p>

<p><p>I think it will just get lost in a cluster of other posts. It is good to have its own dedicated sub in my opinion. I don't visit the_donald so I think others like me that don't wouldn't be able to get and share the information they want without all the other stuff. And either way, it is going to attract more people either way...being the internet it is hard to avoid idiots anywhere lol</p></p>

<p><p>meh, put the truth out however. just because YOU think some people wont like the "he's a satanist!" approach doesn't mean it wont work on some people. just like how your passive approach wont work on some people. don't try to put rules around exposing the truth</p></p>

<p><p>Haha no evidence? There is a virtual shit ton of evidence, albeit circumstantial, from Wikileaks all the way down to JA's Instagram. Concrete Proof is on it's way though, so keep cleaning up the joint and hiding your tracks. Or better yet, might be time to bail and skip out of the country?</p></p>

<p><p>Exactly. Dont forget that i work for the CIA/FBI and keep children in my basement.</p>
<p>Or maybe, just maybe, it was really just a reaction by someone who read the 1 star votings, thought you guys are crazy because he never heard of any of this and therefore wrote a 5 star comment picking up on details of the 1 star comment. Just maybe... you know?</p></p>

<p><p>For shits and giggles I decided to google one of the many clearly fake positive reviewers for comet ping pong. Very first one I checked happened to be a sculptor named Mary Early who appears to have some connection to Tony Podesta.  (cntrl F and search names)

<p><p>Speaking of the Bands...check out this video from "Sex Stains" -one of the bands promote by Comet Ping Pong. There is a prominently displayed pedo symbol on box throughout the whole video. (the triangle/maze looking symbol that the FBI confirmed is for pedo's)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXZY4-V5OIo</p></p>

<p><p>I guess we need to push back an anti-offensive! Write 0 reviews, include all the fucked material or more better pretend to be customer who felt like something was off in that place and that you wouldn't go to there due to the investigation going around all the weird things associated with that pizza place...</p></p>
