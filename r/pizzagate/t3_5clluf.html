        <strong>Protect yourself.</strong>
        <p><p>Send a mail to your trusted family members and best friends.
point them to https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/</p>
<p>Tell them to go to the police and tell everybody about what is going on if you disappear.</p>
<p>They will probably think it's a joke, but it doesn't matter now, they will eventually know. Cover yourself now.</p></p>

        <p><p>I have a doubt anyone involved will go through trying to kill and murder anyone reading and posting publicly on this for 2 reasons; 1 it will draw attention and 2 there are too many eyes. </p>
<p>If someone were to find a smoking gun, that may be a different story.</p>
<p>Connections made are suspicious but are no smoking gun and cannot be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. To be honest I'm more worried about people getting side tracked and making weak links that have nothing to do with what was found in the emails (Such as Pizza underground band, which is just a shitty art project). </p>
<p>I think there is something to all this, it is too creepily in line with pedo code on deepweb forums and makes no fucking sense in any other context and too many strange coincidences have been made from too many people who would know better. But since 4chan is kill on this subject the quality of research has gone down. Sadly I think this may end on a cold trail with lots of 'coincident' but no smoking gun. I also think too many people who read about the watchers and the franklin coverup will keep trying to focus on anything desperate to link and turn this into the tinfoil hour.</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is why I don't bother with a throwaway. </p>
<p>5k are subbed to /r/pizzagate (i'm not one of those, so there is plenty more people browsing and posting that aren't subbed. </p>
<p>Who knows how many more are on 4chan. </p>
<p>/r/conspiracy has nearly 400k subscribers. </p>
<p>The other sub(bear related, should we mention it?) has 2.5k subs. </p>
<p>It wouldn't go unnoticed if someone related to this died, as long as people around them know about this. I've told some of my friends about this, both as a subliminal "hey I'm browsing and researching this and people are disappearing etc", and for them to have chance to realise whats up in the future.</p>
<p>Point is, tell your family or friends. Not for your own safety, but because they might redpill on this in the future if they're aware of this or related pedo rings. </p>
<p>I myself redpilled during the Saville revelations, and went from there to investigate previous occurrences, give your close ones the same chance.  </p></p>
