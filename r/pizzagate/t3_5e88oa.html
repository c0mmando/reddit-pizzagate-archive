        <p><p>Don Rockwell's About Me</p>
<p>"Don Rockwell (DonRocks) comes to food and wine writing after a failed acting career in adult films, where he grew tired of the humiliation of having a body double. Highly regarded both for his mastication and his moist knoedels, he spends his free time playing the vibraphone, and enjoys relaxing at home with his tarsier, Makombogo."</p>
<p>I should mention this isn't directly related to lhohq.info, but I wanted to point out how many shady websites cometpingpong is associated with</p></p>

        <p><p>The whole website is bizarre. Include the Vitruve being drawn over washington DC along with the Equilateral trangles drawn within circles...pizza slice? I mentioned this before in my previous posts, but child victims in France, when drawing their aggressors, the drew white robes, with a triangle in a circle drawn on them. Two different kids, two different reports, same description.</p></p>

<p>This has been discussed a few times in some length. There's a lot going on with this network of sites. lhohq.info is connected to a series of accounts run by a person who believes they are a time traveling Reptilian (no, I'm sincerely not joking). They are huge, but easily scraped.</p>
<p>This person has access to a lot of classified and important government material, claims to work in government, and has used Ken Rockwell's photos for his social media accounts. Look up "Bentley Ptythylhlyl"</p></p>

        <p><p>Found this clicking through the site.   <br>
 http://www.lhohq.info/cinema/lhohq_insomnia_movie.html         <br>
It's nothing overtly pedo, but very odd.      </p>
<p>Edit: Here is another page I found from there.     <br>
http://www.blizzhackers.cc/viewtopic.php?f=52&amp;t=357587&amp;sid=cfd4ebcde1eecb0ec2dc97631ec1190d      <br>
The links to the pictures seems to be dead, but if you scroll down to "DragonGeo2" you will see the two hearts pedo symbol in the forum signature With the text"Jason Fall - The state of the Comet" </p></p>
