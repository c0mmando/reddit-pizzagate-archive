<strong>Honeypots are now getting posted! Be careful!</strong>
<p><p>Mods are starting to PM people.</p>
<p>You might get invited to be a mod yourself, or they might invite you to something called "Matrix", "Riot". Links are also going around with that lloq site. </p>
<p>These are honeypots. This whole place has been comprimised, every thread about mods has been LOCKED. All I ask is that you look at the facts yourself. The honeypots are used to tie your online identities together, and to collect IP addresses, and attempt to run Magic Lantern against your machine.</p>
<p>They are trying changing their tactics now, and trying to fit in first.</p></p>

<p><p>How about the next time you or anyone else post a topic about this you provide some PROOF behind your supposition?</p>
<p>Correct The Record several months ago was posting links to PDF files, "Discord" links (that weren't actually hosted on Discord servers), and Google Doc links all aimed at collecting IP addresses. Where's your proof that any of the mods have done the same?</p>
<p>You are posting tons of threads with wild suppositions but not supporting them in any way. Simply stating "Look at the facts yourself" means jack shit if you didn't provide any facts.</p></p>
