        <strong>Biljana Djurdjevic came to a Donation event.</strong>
        <p><p>Biljana Djurdjevic is the artist of the pedophilic paintings that are on Tony Podesta and Comet Ping Pong's walls.</p>
<p>I was researching her and found out she, under Leslie Dach's money,   RSVP'ed for a donation program for some event! </p>

<p>This means that Biljana Djurdjevic was not just selling paintings to these people. She was actively going to events.</p></p>
