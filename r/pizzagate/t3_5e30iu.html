        <strong>A year or almost a year I read something very interesting that now that I think about it can maybe linked to here.</strong>
        <p><p>I can't find the source anymore but maybe was it worldnews or conspiracy? I forgot but it has an article about how in a church in England or u.k? Well they found hundreds of children's skeletons. They said they seemed to be sacrificed in the church. If I remember correctly it was mentioned how a lot of the powerful people of London visite that church so maybe was it anyway related to #Pizzagate? I have always told my friends about it but now it does make sense. If any one can help me find it I'll appreciate it.</p></p>

        <p><p>I heard a story of a nunnery near the small american town that I grew up in. a guy was cleaning out all the old soot from a long unused coal heating furnace and found a lot of infant skeletons that were apparently from the Spanish flu outbreak in the early 1900s</p></p>

        <p><p>I read something similar within the past few days- there are multiple places in the US that those kind of sites have been found- one I <em>think</em> was in Florida at either a school or a daycare, I can't remember which. I think I read that at just the one place they uncovered thousands of skeletons. This shit is too sickening.</p></p>
