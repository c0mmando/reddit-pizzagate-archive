<p>In my opinion, this stuff <strong>strikes me more like weird hipster/artsy stuff</strong> compared to the Comet Ping Pong accounts. But might as well share it.</p>
<p>Her song oddly enough has a pizza logo, for a jamaican pizza place called Vibez Pizza. It doesn't seem suspicious, more coincidental/drive-by.</p>

<li>Lia is definitely into esoteric stuff like witchcraft, tarot, astrology, etc:  http://archive.is/yBGBT</li>

<p>.... Achilles Heel (Bar/Venue):</p>
<ul>
<li>The necklase is a reference to Achilles Heal which has similar imagery on its site and instagram posters/zine. ie: http://archive.is/GvLPs</li>

<p>...Scribe Winery  http://scribewinery.com/</p>
<ul>
<li>The "Scribe" word on the bracelet in the drawing above refers to Scribe Winery.</li>
<li>Lia is married to Andrew Mariani co-owner of the winery. He's from DC originally.</li>
<li>They have a creepy old house equipped w/ pizza oven: http://marymchenry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Sonoma_wedding08.jpg</li>
<li>"Mariani studied enology briefly at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo but focused on international agriculture. After school, he worked for the European Union delegation in <strong>Washington, D.C.</strong>, and moonlighted at a wine bar. Wine won. He moved to Greece to work at La Tour Melas. At 23, he returned and began planning Scribe."</li>
<li>What's odd is that the company instagram is private -- not sure why a public company would hide their social media. Maybe you have to be part of their "wine club"

<li>related to John Mariani? a foodie writer: http://www.johnmariani.com/aboutus/index.html  -- unlikely.</li>
