        <p><p>Depends on what you mean by "the" tunnels. There are a ton of tunnels underneath DC. Some are used for legitimate purposes, others are empty and abandoned. But there's an underground network of passages on the level of Disney World.</p>
<p>As far as I know, no one has connected them directly to anything Pizzagate-related, though. All I've seen is speculation, though I would love for someone to prove me wrong.</p></p>

<p>Christ. So it's <em>possible</em> they could be using them?? </p></p>

        <p><p>The Disney tunnels are used by employees. Cafeterias, barbers, and so custodians can traverse the park quickly without dragging garbage through the thousands of guests. </p>
<p>Not really a secret </p></p>

        <p><p>Tunnels under D.C. </p>
<p>People have claimed to have gone into them, that they are using them, and that latest video find from 2007 of a kid screaming.</p></p>

        <p><p>Interesting. As far as that kid screaming video it's possible that it was the girl with her parents walking screaming. Give it a second watch, it's hard to tell with the traffic but she's there. Still though inconclusive </p></p>

        <p><p>I agree. However the amount of coincidence is starting to tip the scales...</p>
<p>I don't know man. </p></p>

        <p><p>It looks more like the parents and the kid with them turn when they hear the scream, and they turn to comet when they hear it.</p>
<p>They see the two guys playing ping pong, and they don't flinch, so they must assume that whatever it is must be normal, otherwise those guys would be looking to the scream as well--but they don't budge.</p>
<p>It's disturbing as hell.</p>
<p>My only reservation is that it seems a little <em>too</em> convenient that it would be caught on an unrelated video like that, but at the same time, it's a little <em>too</em> convenient that a bunch of people who disgust me are actually guilty of disgusting crimes...so I'm torn.</p></p>

        <p><p>Apparently there is a tunnel system connecting a few of the businesses on the block where comet pizza and besta are located.</p></p>

        <p><p>Pretty sure they just dug a hole in the basement to the actual DC tunnels.</p></p>
