        <strong>Planned Parenthood could be connected.</strong>
        <p><p>Katy Perry's donation of $10,000 To Planned Parenthood is a start. look up Planned Parenthood's policies on anything to do with kids. stuff like</p>
<p>"learning about our sexuality and achieving sexual health and well-being are lifelong processes that begin at birth and continue throughout our lives" 
&amp;
Planned Parenthood consistently fights any law requiring parental consent or involvement for minors seeking sexual and reproductive health care, including abortions. (Kids could get help without asking perants could be ok i guess. )</p>
<p>This is already far too long I wanted to point at Planned Parenthood and say don’t forget these guys.
With Katy Perry encouraging the anti-trump, riots she cant be too far outside of this. </p></p>

        <p><p>They are connected. Check out the Children of God for Life church. They are an off shoot of the Children of God church, which was "dismantled" after they were prosecuted for pedophilia. Their choir also performed at the White House during the Bush and Clinton administrations. They are now called The Family International (TFI). </p>
<p>Edit to add: River Phoenix's family was in the COG church and left before the pedophilia accusations and his mother was very vocal about the church's strange sexual practices. Now, think about how Katie Perry and others grew up in very religious families and how they are now. COGs fight hard against abortion. Whether these people are against or for abortion, like Perry, their practices still feed the beast because the children who are aborted are still used to further their sick goals and energies as are the children who are not aborted. In a nutshell, all roads lead to Rome. </p></p>

        <p><p>That link says absolutely nothing about the sale of aborted baby parts. Please don't let your political convictions hold too much sway on your research.</p></p>

        <p><p>sorry. That link looks like its just about the Soros donation.</p>
<p>As far as baby parts for sale goes there only seems be be vidioes. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjxwVuozMnU">In the first video:</a> Dr. Deborah Nucatola of Planned Parenthood commented on baby-crushing: “We’ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I’m not gonna crush that part, I’m gonna basically crush below, I’m gonna crush above, and I’m gonna see if I can get it all intact.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjCs_gvImyw">In the second video:</a>  Planned Parenthood’s Dr. Mary Gatter joked, “I want a Lamborghini” as she negotiated the best price for baby parts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw2xi9mhmuo">In the third video:</a> Holly O’Donnell, a former Stem Express employee who worked inside a Planned Parenthood clinic, detailed first-hand the unspeakable atrocities and how she fainted in horror over handling baby legs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWQuZMvcFA8">In the fourth video:</a> Planned Parenthood’s Dr. Savita Ginde stated, “We don’t want to do just a flat-fee (per baby) of like, $200. A per-item thing works a little better, just because we can see how much we can get out of it.” She also laughed while looking at a plate of fetal kidneys that were “good to go.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egGUEvY7CEg">In the fifth video:</a> Melissa Farrell of Planned Parenthood-Gulf Coast in Houston boasted of Planned Parenthood’s skill in obtaining “intact fetal cadavers” and how her “research” department “contributes so much to the bottom line of our organization here, you know we’re one of the largest affiliates, our Research Department is the largest in the United States.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABzFZM73o8M">In the sixth video:</a> Holly O’Donnell described technicians taking fetal parts without patient consent: “There were times when they would just take what they wanted. And these mothers don’t know. And there’s no way they would know.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzMAycMMXp8">In the seventh and perhaps most disturbing video:</a> Holly O’Donnell described the harvesting, or “procurement,” of organs from a nearly intact late-term fetus aborted at Planned Parenthood Mar Monte’s Alameda clinic in San Jose, CA. “‘You want to see something kind of cool,’” O’Donnell says her supervisor asked her. “And she just taps the heart, and it starts beating. And I’m sitting here and I’m looking at this fetus, and its heart is beating, and I don’t know what to think.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCQno6hdU6s">In the eighth video:</a> StemExpress CEO Cate Dyer admits Planned Parenthood sells “a lot of” fully intact aborted babies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndJMawjoyPc">The ninth video:</a> catches a Planned Parenthood medical director discussing how the abortion company sells fully intact aborted babies — including one who “just fell out” of the womb.</p></p>

        <p><p>I would believe it being fake i couldn't find many good sources. Shame, better to get back to the heart of the problem here at Pizzagate anyway.</p></p>
