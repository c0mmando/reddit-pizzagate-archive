    I think they have something up their sleeve.
   </p>
   <p>
    Think about how the Podesta emails begin EXACTLY the day Maddie McCann went missing.
   </p>
   <p>
    I think that may have been a threat to the establishment.
   </p>
   <p>
    Basically saying "We know."
   </p>
   <p>
    Also, remember them talking about Phase 3... What if PizzaGate is phase three. They dropped a few bread crumbs for people to follow and it blew up.
   </p>
   <p>
    If they just dropped the child exploitation, occult stuff on the public with no primer, it might all fly under the radar.
   </p>
   <p>
    Look how many people are involved now.
   </p>
   <p>
    Even though we keep saying we are looking for the smoking gun, there is enough circumstantial evidence to make you see what the reality of the situation is, an underground child exploitation ring in DC with all higher ups involved, including the president ( bracelet with pizza charm, email discussing him spending 65,000$ on pizza and hot dogs flown in from Chicago. )
   </p>
   <p>
    I think now that they got the party started, the real damaging goods will deal the death blow.
   </p>
   <p>
    Would like your thoughts.

    I doubt it, they say Assange is already taken into custody and either dead or being tortured. His last interview video with that one Brit fellow was edited, his internet connection was cut and the airport nearby was shut down. Wikileaks was called out a few times about making mistakes and the New York Times published an article stating that we need Wikileaks.
   </p>
   <p>
    At this point until I see the man himself, take his blood, test it for DNA and then confirm that he is actually Assange I'm not trusting anything.

     I agree. But guess what...
    </p>
    <p>
     The dead man switch isn't what you think.
    </p>
    <p>
     This data they have, was always meant to be released Assange gone or not. He isn't the only one with it. I'm sure they will find a way to get the data out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Assange stated at WL 10th anniversary, that the show will go on in the event he can't be around.

      The data is already out, or atleast most of it. Question is, will we get keys in the case that WL is compromised, and Assange is missing.

     His last interveiw was with RT.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why would RT be in on it?
    </p>
    <p>
     The day after the embassy had its internet cut RT had ther bank accounts frozen in the uk.
    </p>
    <p>
     https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/russia-todays-uk-bank-accounts-frozen-says-editor
    </p>
    <p>
     The two things must be related ,me thinks?
    </p>
    <p>
     What if RT interview was a kidnap/escape by Assange?
    </p>
    <p>
     What if when the embassy was raided Julian was already gone?
    </p>
    <p>
     RT bank frozen in response?

    I am dubious.  I think WL is f'd.   I am a little frustrated with them.  If they were actually sitting on a bombshell load of emails to blow this whole thing up, and they decided to drag it out sloooow, then it just wasn't well played in my opinion.  People say the leaks were the only thing keeping assange alive; but i would argue that a slow drip was just motivating the enemy more and giving them more time to arrange the hit.
   </p>
   <p>
    Still not positive what happened - but I think dramatizing the whole leak release was a really stupid and dangerous ploy, knowing what they were up against.  This is of course assuming that they actually had something big; maybe they didn't and this was just good marketing for them.
   </p>
   <p>
    But yea, doing it the way that they did was just begging for somebody to kill or topple them.  Not smart at all if you ask me.  I would have purchased fake identification in a foreign third world country and just leaked it all right away or something and let the world deal with the shitstorm of leaks.
