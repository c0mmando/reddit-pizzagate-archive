    Let's break the case.
   </h1>
   <p>
    Alright, so many people will go on this sub and wonder what it is about, and see these pictures that are a thousand centimeters long with arrows leading from person to person, that have been pasted in with Paint, etc etc.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not talking down, I think it's
    <strong>
     TREMENDOUS
    </strong>
    and fantastic that the people here work so hard to uncover this (possible) sick sick sick conspiracy.
   </p>
   <p>
    As a voice actor I have done some motion graphics videos, and I found that those videos are always an
    <strong>
     extremely
    </strong>
    clear way of proving a point and/or introducing people to a theme.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'd love to do the voice over for a
    <strong>
     motion graphics animation
    </strong>
    video (which should be shorter than 2 minutes to keep the attention of the people).
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm talking about this style of video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmU9x_8gZ2g .
   </p>
   <p>
    Anyways, I'm willing to do all of this for free (of course), and I believe that if we publish a video about this that is concise and clear, this will 100% lead to more people getting interested, investigating and can eventually lead to a
    <strong>
     break in the case
    </strong>
    .

    <strong>
     What we need:

    Yes, and project it on a wall in the middle of DC during a high foot traffic time. Right on the side of the White House would make an excellent screen.

      I would love to see this done. Can you imagine all the people who would be whipping out their phones and filming it? It would be added to so many different internet platforms from so many different sources, it would be extremely tough to scrub.

       exactly, it would market itself, the global "conspiracy" trigger would be literally activated for anyone that watches the video, we just have to compile the right content that doesn't sound TOO crazy conspiracy aluminum hat wearer and too satanic witchcraft crack pot shit.. even though all thos things are very true in the most literal form

    I'm an amateur audio producer - I've produced many bands and a few local comics - I could do the sound for the production.  For example, mix the vocals and try to compose some ominous sounding backing track to give it the vibes and complement the visual.
   </p>
   <p>
    Once you have a transcript, if you read it straight through and record it with a decent microphone, I can clean it up make it sound clear and even, and break it up to go with the production.
   </p>
   <p>
    Also, I can help you guys develop a transcript too.  The important thing is to develop a 'story': we need a beginning, a middle and an end-  for example:
   </p>
   <p>
    -What is pizzagate?
-What spurred the investigation
-Who is (may be) involved?
-Some important historical context (maybe talk about Haiti, missing children (show articles in the video), huge busted trafficking rings, people who are known pedos that are in cohoots with our politicians (i.e Jeffrey epstein and pizza shop owners) people who have been investigating and died/went missing i.e. That woman that died last week investigating the CF, show alex jones and/or steve pisceznic talking about pedophilia)
-reference them to r/pizzagate, so we can grow the community
   </p>
   <p>
    Something along those lines

      I'm happy to help with the overall structure and continuity of the transcript- but the people who would best be able to populate the script with pertinent information would probably be the people who have done the digging and know what the most damning facts have been that they have dug up.
     </p>
     <p>
      My recommendation would be this: we should create a shared folder, maybe dropbox(?), that we all have permissions to and that we can make changes.  We can set up a file for the transcript and allow people to contribute their thoughts to it.  We should also have other folders dedicated to the video media (i.e. A folder for any recordings/sound clips you want in the video, and a folder for visual elements).
     </p>
     <p>
      That way, the people splicing the video together can just go into the shared folder and pick the media out from there as they see fit.  Also, everybody involved should create local copies of the shared folder incase we get infiltrated and somebody tries to sabotage the project.  Dropbox shows you a summary of who makes changes to what, so you would be able to find out if somebody was fucking around.

       That's a very good idea, actually. Although I rather think we should not allow everyone to edit but just an expanding group of people who ask for permission first to stop everyone from fucking it and deleting etc

       Do you have a good grasp of the overall story and what is and what isn't known? If you do, then it would be fantastic if you could write a little script (shouldn't take long, maybe an hour), and then /u/The_Watterboy can chime in and make sure it flows well and works well. Then, in maybe a sticky post we can ask the community what they think of it, and if the general idea is that it covers the most probable facts well, then we can continue with the motion graphics, voice over, etc!

       Alright, well that video is more than 30 minutes long. If we can create one which is less than 3 long and well made, and promote the heck out of it, it's gonna be huge.

        I agree that condensing is important; but given the amount of raw data we are working with that could be our biggest issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to set very specific parameters, as in what we are going to cover. I suggest focusing only on the chronology of the  Podesta email dumps to start. "When writing, one must aim like a gun and fire directly at one's target." - Jean-Paul Sartre

       To be fair, he could have easily said "happy" rather than "horny" and I mean, her mom is sitting right there and doesn't flinch.

    Good luck. I can't be of any help. However, try to make it very understandable to laymen and avoid conspiracy terms like 'illuminati' and 'NWO'. Humans are lazy by nature so very few people will have the drive to google things / terms / symbols they don't understand, and conspiracy terms have a negative tinfoil hat connotation to them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Either way, this is a good initiative by any measure. If we assume that pizzagate is not something that the elites have pre-planned, then this is probably the biggest hick-up that the elites have had in the past decades. It's important that it is capitalized on. Having said that, given that we are actually having this subreddit, I have a small feeling we are being astroturfed or this leak is controlled, but hey no one will ever know for sure.

    Who wants to write the Script? Im from Germany, and would do the german translation. I think it is very important to make it sound professional. All those Pizzagate videos on youtube right now are just to long and vague. We need hard facts with a short explanation about wikileaks and so on and this should be a good video to go viral.

    All, I would appreciate an easy to follow pizzagate video. If it is made, direct the content at people who need Redpills. I've had success with redpilling others on pay for play stuff and general corruption. Child molestatikn and pornography will be much tougher to explain, especially for people unfamiliar with the details.
   </p>
   <p>
    It's much easier to explain "Clinton took millions from the Saudis, probably to cover their involvement with ISIS," and support with Wikileaks emails.

    I was just commenting about how we need a fast-paced, modern style video. Most videos out there are informative but too slow to hold people's attention and have that "conspiracy" vibe to them.

    This should be stickied tbh.
   </p>
   <p>
    Can we come up with a general outline/timeline of events, such as?
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     <p>
      FBI Vault releases "x" on twitter...
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      4Chan...
     </p>
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    etc. So that the layman, who knows zero about this would be able to understand with ease.
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit: Although that infographic video example is good, there are several actual photos (actual pedo sign, inside pizza place...) that would need to be integrated. Right?

    As someone who's casually following what's been uncovered so far, I'll add some quick advice:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <p>
      The photos of children on "jimmycomet"s instagram, and the pedophile logo on Besta Pizza are the things that will make people pay attention, and will be the strongest evidence to make them understand that there's suspicious things happening.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      After being familiar with those, the knowledge of underground tunnels and the instagram photo of the hole in the floor, when presented together, act as another piece of compelling suspicious coincidence.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      the other undeniably strange thing that I have yet to see any reasonable explanation for is the pizza-handkerchief email. I'd stay away from most of the other emails, as many of them could potentially have innocent explanations.
     </p>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Stick to the unquestionable, and present facts rather than drawing conclusions (let the audience do that themselves). Including info that could arguably be innocent, or "jumping to conclusions" will give people the ability to dismiss the entire thing as conspiracy.

    the video should end with an emotional hook of some sort (to put the final nail in the coffin convince the viewers  they need to do something about this NOW) and then list specifics things they can do immediately (contact a government official/ sign a petition to the U.N., interpol, etc.) and then a reminder that these horrific acts CAN be stopped. something along these lines "The small group of international elites responsible for these atrocities committed against innocent children have abused their power to keep their depravity hidden, and unpunished, in the darkness, however, by making our outrage known through the proper channels such as through signing
    <em>
     petition name here
    </em>
    , which we've linked in the description, we can force the powers to be to bring these fiends to justice." 
something along those lines.

    OP and /u/whitehatrasta, may I make a suggestion?
   </p>
   <p>
    In addition to the sound, any way there could be some readable narration as well? I ask this because I think this video could be great for Facebook.
   </p>
   <p>
    Facebookers and normies often "read" videos while at work or in places they can't have sound. I honestly believe that's why "news" videos like
    <em>
     NowThis
    </em>
    et al became so popular.
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit: Also now that we have a twitter/Clinton foundation connection, that could be good for the video as well.
