   <strong>
    Possible Motive?
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I understand that in some circles it is believed that releasing a lot of life energy all at once (for example genocide) can lead to immortality. Whether or not you personally believe in such a thing, what do you think could possibly be the motive for abusing so many children? What would justify the cost?
   </p>
   <p>
    EDIT: I just remembered I met a girl a few years ago who claimed to have been ritually sexually abused by her father and other family members, who she said were mafia. An interesting thing about this girl, she seemed to have psychic abilities and did not know it. She would ramble on and I would listen and her ramblings would closely follow my train of thought even when it did not pertain to what she was saying or the immediate surroundings. This might be an occult purpose of child abuse, to confer special abilities by fragmenting the ego.

    I'm not sure to be honest. I read an article about how young blood reversed ageing for mice. That's the first thing i was thinking when I read about these rituals and stuff. Just a thought, not claiming anything here.

     Interesting. Doesn't tell me a motive, but establishes a precedence for royal psychopaths.

      The rumor was she bathed or drank the blood of virgins to stay young and/or healthy.

    It is ancient and it is demonic. As hard as it is to understand this, it's the same religious fervor found in radical Islam, with pleasing Satan being the goal. Also, fear/adrenaline saturated blood is supposed to produce some kind of high when ingested. This last point would need further researching. The Bible and historical paganism confirms the first.

    I was just thinking about this...
   </p>
   <p>
    Personally, I think we will gain more ground if we look at the satanic cult angle... We might be able to make more connections. Also, this provides motive. Satanic beliefs &gt; satanic rituals &gt; child trafficking/sacrifice.
   </p>
   <p>
    If we can find more examples of satanist beliefs, more people will believe the child trafficking and pedo allegations.
   </p>
   <p>
    As you illuded to, If someone is satanic, the motive for child trafficking is obvious.
