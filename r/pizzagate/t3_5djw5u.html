        <p><p>This is disturbing. This seems like it should have made national news, but it's 5 years old and I've never heard anything about it. And every day we get new articles like this from around the country and the world. Am I the only one who's starting to get discouraged? Like this shit is so big and involves so many powerful people that we'll never be able to bring it down?</p></p>

        <p><p>I think we're exchanging more information on a bigger scale and people are more skeptical of MSM. I think people are actually waking up and getting pissed off for the right reasons. I like to believe we're on the upswing. </p></p>
