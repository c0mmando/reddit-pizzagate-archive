        <p><p>There is no such paper as the Denver Guardian. This was just a veiled threat to the likes of FBIanon. </p></p>

        <p><p>It's another search engine, like Google. People are trying to move away from Google, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>I have seen someone say that DuckDuckGo is linked to Israel somehow, which is disconcerting, but I don't know.</p>
<p>I try to use StartPage as I've heard it's linked to no one and completely anonymous, but it doesn't give the same kind of results. </p></p>
