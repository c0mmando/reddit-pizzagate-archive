<strong>Ibrahima Diallo is a common name, and more big holes in the theories</strong>
<p><p>DC is filled with African immigrants. Prove the pizza manager and charity director are the same.  </p>
<p>How do we know Dave Flinstone is cheesybay? Cheesybay sells and buys from the UK?  Who hacked his emails? How? Where'd they come from?  </p>
<p>Re: The email with the three kids in the heated pool, it's all a bunch of uptight squares on the message. It's like you guys have never read emails from over-educated, bored white people before. I don't understand how you think Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post, for example, is DTF three kids. Even the hankerchief email sounds more like someone with a liberal arts degree and too much spare time  saying "hey dude did you leave your hankerchief?"  </p>
<p>What's the connection to Kevin the babysitter/masseuse/concierge in the Hamptons?  I think it's possible, I guess, he's some kind of hiding in plain sight fixer to help rich people looking to travel fuck some kids but so many of these connections people drill down on without understanding if it's legit or not. Think harder about this stuff.  </p>
<p>Was the members-only section of comet pizza, with the password protected file listings, real?  </p>
<p>Lastly, I think we can stop looking too hard for codes and embedded content in files. So far those have been exclusively dead ends. Hillary couldn't be bothered to use two phones to protect classified shit, do you think billionaire pedos are going to be spending all afternoon fucking with encryption software?  I fucking doubt it.  </p>
<p>I think we've stumbled on some strange shit, but it's hard to see how there's credible evidence beyond that the Podestas are super creeps that love fucked up art and hanging around with fucked up artists. Please prove me wrong. </p></p>

<p><p>I'm not saying stop this is all totally pointless (though I really do think the codes thing is pretty pointless), I'm saying a lot of this shit, to outside observers or critical thinkers, doesn't actually add up.  People are told "this is a connection" and then drill down on it without understanding if the connection itself is real.  </p>
<p>Do you think a prosecutor or detective would not ask the same questions as I just did?</p></p>

<p><p>He's not in court yet. This is evidence building. Either help or stay quiet.</p></p>

<p><p>He's officially listed on the WHOIS for besta pasta. He's on the Wikileaks emails. What about this is tenuous?</p></p>

<p><p>Ummm...you do realize that many pedos go to great lengths to avoid getting caught?  They use code and cheese pizza is known code for child porn. They also use steganography to hide messages in pics.  And if you were running or a major player in a large pedo ring you'd be stupid not to use code.  In fact these people got as far as they did because they used code. </p></p>

<p><p>Agree, he's PIVOTAL in this. His name is all over the Besta whois. A review has mentioned his name directly.</p>
<p>He has many other websites and is also mentioned in Wikileak emails.</p></p>

<p><p>Multiple people can have the same name. It's disconcerting to me you seem to have trouble understanding what I'm asking.</p>
<p>I'm open to being wrong here, so please correct me, but as far as I can tell there is no evidence demonstrating the pizza man and the charity man ARE THE SAME PERSON. Is there an address that links the two? Photos of him at work? A bio page that says "In addition to his charity work, Diallo also owns Besta Pizza?" There's no evidence, that I am aware of, that demonstrate these are the same people.  </p></p>

<p><p>How many people of that name do you think live within a few minutes of each other! The orphanage and Besta pizza are only minutes away from each other! He's unlikely to publicly mention he's connections if the place is what we thing it is...</p></p>
