        <p><p>Seriously. We don't need to lose some leads because you shared it and someone didn't save it before it got nuked. Save it to your computer, phone, the cloud. Make a dummy account if you don't feel safe having it on a normal one. Use web archive as redundancy. Thanks for all your work.</p>
