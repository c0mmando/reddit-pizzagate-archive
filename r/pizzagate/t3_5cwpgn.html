        <strong>New here with a few questions and ideas...</strong>
        <p><p>So I just found out about this whole thing after seeing a post on the wikileaks AMA. Considering the response it got on the ama and all the evidence, it seems pretty suspicious.</p>
<p>Despite only just learning about it, I'm already seeing things getting taken down...which only adds to the suspicion. Now, this could all be coincidence, and I like to remain skeptical and analyze both sides of the story. However, I would rather be wrong and spent hours investigating than right but not done anything while kids suffer.</p>
<p>Having said that, I wonder how secure reddit is and how long it will last. Has anyone discussed making a secure server like TPB or the former KAT was doing? I'm sure it is easier said than done, but do we have anyone in the community that has these capabilities?</p>
<p>At the risk of sounding super tin-foil-hatish, what about our own individual security? Should we tell people around us what we are researching and that if, on the off chance, we go missing or something happens they should be aware of what is going on? Obviously we can't post our information online because that would put our identities at risk, so telling people we know sounds like the best security measure I can think of.</p>
<p>Lastly, I saw someone had recently mentioned there was a pedo support tumblr. Has anyone reached out to them and asked for assistance? I may be in the minority here, but I believe pedophilia is a mental illness but doesn't make a person automatically criminal. I'm sure a lot of them would be glad to assist, be it helping us with terms, identifying people, or recognizing warning signs.</p></p>

        <p><p>Hmmm reaching out to the pedo community seems VERY risky, but I do see where you are coming from. I don't think we can take the chance. As far as the links you may be following from this subreddit, you should probably be using tor, at least. Better safe than sorry. Up to you to tell someone, many people believe this is happening and are reserved about speaking out about it as well. </p></p>

        <p><p>Not sure why reaching out would be risky. At least how I see it, it would be the same as reaching out to an AA group asking if they could help with a case involving smuggled alcohol.</p>
<p>And thank you! I do use tor and a vpn :)</p></p>
