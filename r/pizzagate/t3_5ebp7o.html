        <strong>NYT Prefix "Fact Check:" removed in last hour</strong>
        <p><p>So we have all seen the NYT article that gives no substantial evidence to #pizzagate being made up!
It was titled "Fact Check: This Pizzeria is Not a Child Trafficking Site." They have now removed the words "Fact Check," from the title.</p>
<p>Just an interesting observation, heh.</p></p>

        <p><p>That article is an example of journalists telling people what to think, not investigating, straight up. </p></p>

        <p><p>MSM is still very partisan... but just like there are people in the FBI that joined to promote justice... there are people in the media that joined to spread the truth... Their bosses are the ones in positions of power... and dictate the end results. The fact that this isn't totally plowed under shows that the good reporters are trying to get the story out any way they can... even if it is gimped and censored as fuck by their supervisors... they are still getting the message to people at home... a lot of people. People distrustful of MSM and realizing that to find the truth they need to seek it out themselves. </p>
<p>Any mention of this in the media is good... even if it is labeled as "fake news" or "debunked"... it makes people think and dig... reaching an audience that 4chan and reddit never could... </p></p>

        <p><p>Sadly that's the strat, they can say "We never lied, we just told a story not like we said it was facts." and wash their hands of any guilt.</p>
<p>We know peoples attention spans, they don't have time to look at an article already posted to see if it changed the narrative in any way, they take the first story and run it is truth in their head.</p>
<p>That's what this is all about. Getting a story out with a narrative they can push so that people can just scoff at anyone that tries to expose the truth of it. Then while they slightly alter the title to suggest that they didn't trick the consumer, they don't have to be held liable for the lie they fed to mislead the people that trust them.</p></p>
