    I've been talking to someone who claims to be a Mkultra and Satanic abuse victim she claims it took place in one of these Mormon churches. Since then I've been looking into Mormons and I believe they are heavily connected to the making of these mind slaves. Apparently, the Mormons believe Satan was Jesus brother and Jesus was wrongly picked, they also believe Godhood is obtainable through rituals.

    No. So much no.

   <p>
    If this happened it's isolated to a rogue group and
    <em>
     not
    </em>
    organizational. Some of the old buildings in UT have basements for HVAC and whatnot, not with hidden doors.

    Source: lifetime LDS member. Helped build chapels. No hidden secret satanic ritual rooms.
   </p>
   <p>
    Also: LDS doctrine believes the only way to return to God is through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Satan is the adversary, the tempter, and we
    <em>
     do not
    </em>
    in any way justify or find good in the devil.

     I'm 99% sure the Mormons have something to do with it every person I've found who went through SRA at some point had abuse that take place in the Mormon church. Besides this pretty much every ex-satanist claims them to be connected to SRA and Mkultra.

       It reminds me of the abuse in the Catholic Church. For a long time, most people never would've believed what was occurring and being actively covered up. Just because the majority of congregants are not in on the conspiracy doesn't mean it's not happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not making any claims on whether or not LDS people are guilty, but it's worth keeping an open mind as people investigate every possible avenue.

        I'll keep my eye out for anything suspicious. Maybe in 44 years of going to church and never once getting any kind of bad vibe or spidey sense, I was just blind to a giant pervasive generational conspiracy.

    Mormons have been warning everyone about "secret combinations" (aka conspiracies) for 186 years. It's basically the entire plot of the Book of Mormon: secret band of murderous robbers in league with Satan takes over government, destroys civilization, new civilization rises, repeat.
   </p>
   <p>
    To suggest that the oldest and most consistent voice
    <em>
     against
    </em>
    Satanic conspiracies is actually part of one is preposterous.

     Pretty much every religious institute since ancient Rome has been infiltrated by ppl who worship the Babylonian Sun deity for example December 25th is not Jesus bday its made clear in the bible this is impossible but it is the birthday of Saturn/Baal/Satan and when you celebrate Christmas you are doing a ritual for him.

       Look into the history of Christmas there are many videos exposing it and it was banned in the US till 1820. The bible specifically says to not cut a tree down and to definitely not decorate it with silver and gold.

         Make jokes all you want but what exactly is normal about #pizzagate we have ppl worldwide involved in satanic rituals, human sacrifice, cannibalism, rape, etc. I wear my tinfoil hat with pride everything going on currently has been reported on for literally 50+ years by us "conspiracy theorist".

          Christmas was not "banned in the US" at any time. Because, you know, there's that whole "freedom of religion" thing.
         </p>
         <p>
          There were prohibitions in certain pre-Revolutionary colonies and the holiday faded in popularity prior to Charles Dickens'
          <em>
           A Christmas Carol
          </em>
          . Additionally, it wasn't recognized as a national holiday until 1870.

     while at the same time teaching masonic rituals (secret cominbations) so in that they discredit themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Given the EXTENSIVE cultural wide (multiple sects of themormon church) history of pedophilia in the  mormon church starting with Joseph Smith and continuing in the polygamist sects today it's worth considering. If someone tries to tell you it was normal to marry 14year olds then, or worse your step daughters (an incredibly common occurrence) that is mormon apologist propaganda.
    </p>
    <p>
     If there is a real connection or not you are hitting too close to home. If you thought CTR is bad you have not seen the mormons swarm on reddit or other social media sites.
    </p>
    <p>
     The reality is that there are ALARMING similarities in organizational structure between satanic churches, masons, and mormons. Mormons have NWO political ties going way back. if you want to get crazy conspiracy w/it look into the mormon connection to 9/11 inside job. Look into the mormon connection to state sanctioned torture. Also the mormon record on child abuse is long, most recently the 'wilderness therapy' ranches for "troubled boys." I personally think it is likely many 'born' mormons have experienced the type of intergenerational trauma that primes dissociation due to the abusive nature of relationships in the mormon church especially during polygamy (which is frequently within 3-4 generations of even your most mainstream mormon.)

      They have infiltrated everything.
15. Infiltrate Freemasonry to take advantage of the Grand Orient Lodges to cloak the true nature of their work in philanthropy. Spread their atheistic-materialistic ideology amongst the “Goyim” (gentiles).

       what mormon's talk about are stories. Listen to their own prophets, "the truth isn't always useful." They're discouraged from researching their own history just like every koolaid cult.

    Exmormon here. Mormonism is a normal religion in the sense that your average member is just trying to lead a faithful life and to be a good person.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, what I will say is that Mormonism has undeniable ties to the occult and your average Mormon doesn't delve into the meanings or history behind their temple ordinances. Joseph Smith was a believer in folk magic, and Mormon temple rituals mirror those of the freemasons. You can find some satanic symbolism in those rituals if you look for them, but again, I want to emphasize that your average Mormon is a good person, and a believer in fairly normal, Christian-goodness. If you are interested in digging deeper, there are videos on YouTube from a guy named newnamenoah where you can watch the temple rituals. /r/exmormon is a growing community too, although realize it is largely a community for healing, so be kind.
   </p>
   <p>
    As for ties to satanic ritual abuse, I couldn't say if there is some truth to that, but it certainly isn't rampant or a part of everyday Mormonism. The CIA does heavily recruit from LDS, so there may very well be some ties between
    <em>
     some
    </em>
    Mormons and stuff like mk ultra.

     OFC I am not saying that the everyday Mormon is connected but the institute and higher ups pretty much every major satanist claims the LBS to be heavily connected to SRA.

      Understood. I guess I just felt the need to qualify my statement due to the fact that I have many loved ones who are still practicing Mormons. My other point I guess is that while it's easy to connect Mormonism to occultism and even satanism, that doesn't necessarily mean it has any ties whatsoever to SRA. It certainly could be though.
     </p>
     <p>
      I just remembered there was some recent issue tied up in the court about sex abuse with the LDS church in a Navajo summer camp or something like that. I haven't delved into that and I don't have the time right now, but there might be something there.

     for mk ultra connection see BYU reparitive shock therapy and the psychiatrists involved, especially who they studied under during the 60s for their MK connections.

    No. Get your mormon theology right. Jesus has always been super good, Satan's always been evil, and all, including you, Jesus, and Satan are brothers and sisters.
   </p>
   <p>
    The rituals are easily found online, and while odd, nothing encouraging evil is found in them.

     Mormon temples are all littered with satanic/occult symbols and every ex-satanist and expert on these matters mention the Mormon church at some point. I'm not suggesting the general population of Mormon know but the institute and higher ups.

       you are missing the facts here. to anyone knowledgeable about occult symbols it basically says "this is a church of satan" all over the temple. Honestly mormons should be embarrassed they don't know. At least if you are going to discredit it make ONE google search to verify. This is "besta pizza" level obvious stuff.

         oh right, if you are a mormon you aren't allowed to google that because search results aren't "official church doctrine." For the rest of us that don't live a willifully ignorant life the writing is on the wall and you're still "baptizing the dead" on oxen baptismal font...

      I cannot deny an occult heritage, but I will deny that immoral things come from it in the current LDS church. Perhaps in some of the polygamist sects.

       Ppl need to open their eyes almost all SRA victim will mention the LBS and IMO it makes perfect sense LBS have been accused of SRA/MKultra and forcing little girls to marry grown men for decades. LBS is a cult. http://www.eaec.org/cults/mormons.htm

         There are websites that break down the differences between Mormons and Christianity they are completely different Mormons believe in multiple gods, that humans can become god etc. when compared side by side it's clear they just use similar words.

    Dont pay attention to the 'negative Nancy's'. I have posted a few things and had some theories and there were quite a few people that called me a shill, troll and talked shit on my ideas.
   </p>
   <p>
    These people are trying to discourage more research. In my opinion these are ctr or people trying to cover it up.
   </p>
   <p>
    Keep posting your ideas, theories and research. You never know which piece of evidence might spur a revelation or a breakthrough.

    Good work!

     Lifelong Mormon, lifelong democrat (until this election), have been on the pizza-gate bandwagon since day one trying to assist in exposing these sick MF's.  Not a CTR.  It is possible that someone may have accessed a church building for the purpose of abusing children.  However, this would be a sick individual or individuals and has nothing to do with the doctrine or practices within the LDS church.

      Keep up the good work.

      I was skeptical of this stuff at first, but I always knew something was not right. I thought it was related to drugs, not child trafficking.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regardless, I have been trying to research and connect the dots when I can, but I just don't have the time or resources. The people actively pursuing the truth, in this sub and pol, are doing amazing work.
     </p>
     <p>
      As much as I think this stuff is happening, it sickens me. I wish it was not true, but I'm afraid that the abuse going on is very real.

       It's MKultra trauma based mind control using drugs, violent rape, terror, torture till they break the child's mind and create Dissociative Identity Disorder. MKultra was supposedly perfected in the 80's and most people who are under mind control will never know.

    I grew up mormon and I have a dissociative disorder. I don't remember any satanic abuse but I do remember specific indoctrination to teach compartmentalizing/dissociative skills. I do have multiple family members that have satanic/programming memories and I don't believe they are even knowledgable about MK ultra.
