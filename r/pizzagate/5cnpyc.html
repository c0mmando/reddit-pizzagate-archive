    Eli is a minor, and as such you documenting a 'supposed' link to this puts him, and any other kid in risk of pedophilia activity. It's the context, the link only you have made. If any of the kids become a victim after posts have been made, the poster, the moderators, and Reddit have culpability in that criminal activity because Reddit is a public space. In other words, there could be litigation or even jail time (what if a poster is using the Reddit community to ID these kids, and then seeks them out as 'easy targets?')
