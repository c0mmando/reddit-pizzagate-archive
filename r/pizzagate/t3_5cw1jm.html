<p><p>I chose this subreddit because one of the chefs in the Chef Circle is James Alefantis, owner of Comet. 
Please see my lengthier comment with more info and timeline.  </p></p>

<p><p>I remember Podesta and his army cook book, someone contacted me to tell me that "alpha" is a code word used, there are some links to the military, and I've noticed there is a frat/sorority called Alpha kappa Alpha that seems to be related as well. No tangible evidence yet, just some dots being connected.</p></p>

<p><blockquote>
<p>Tony was very interested in hosting a cooking fundraising event similar to
the event we hosted in June with Chef Nora Pouillon and recruited a few
area Chefs to participate. James Alefantis, Amy Brandwein and Massimo
Fabbri are personal friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just googled Amy Brandwein, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two things you won’t see on the menu: pizza and risotto.</p>
<p>“I’m just totally sick of [pizza]. I can barely even eat it,” she said. Years of making risotto have had a similar effect: “I just couldn’t bear the thought of stirring a risotto pot every night.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe she's sick of the evil shi that's going on around there. Or maybe, these politicians really love pizza and pasta so much that the chef is literally sick of making those</p>

<p><p>The spirit cooking with Marina Abramovic took place on July 7, 2015. </p>
<p>On July 1, 2015 
Very odd email from Tamara Luzzatto. She's the one who's girls are mentioned in the email about adding entertainment by being in the pool. 
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/42356</p>
<p>In it she closes with  "fratelli Ps" Italian for "brothers." (There is also a NYC pizza restaurant named fratellis ) </p>
<p>Reference to restaurant? Or tony and John?
Definitely the Podesta brothers as an oct 2015 email reveals.  So she was referring to a dinner event for Leahy on July 21 involving tony and john.  How do I know? </p>
<p>Because  in September an event is proposed
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/19166</p>
<p>It's a "Brothers Podesta dinner"
John is cooking a pasta dish that night. Other invited "chefs". 
Further down a question if he wants to also do a smaller dinner at Madeleine Albrights.  </p>
<p>Email From tony to john with attached draft of program with cooking demonstrations. Asks "do we want this?"
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/41255</p>
<p>Then the email on oct 5 with "Fratelli"  In subject line of a "dinner" reception including  James Alefantis, Comet ping pong owner. It's from Milia Fisher with Hillary for America.<br/>
Dinner is at tony podestas house
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/21136</p>
<p>Notice the capitalized phrase "Chef Circle"
Very peculiar --- the all caps "YOU" whenever referring to John.  What is up with that?  Reminds me of another weird email exchange with Wendy Abrams re Italy where she says "master chef" and then John refers to either himself or Tony as "Enforcer".   This also was in late July 2015.  After the Leahy event.  Not sure if this event took place in Italy 
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/58340</p>
<p>Also, note the schedule.  This is not a dinner. The whole dinner/program part is from 6:45 to 7:20.  No one ever seems to sit down to eat. 
It's definitely some sort of demonstration/possibly ritual taking place in the kitchen featuring this Chef Circle.<br/>
Could it be a reference to the satanic circle? 5 points of the pentagram? Five chefs? 
Fits well with the "spirit cooking". 
Here's a portion of the email with the peculiarly precise schedule for the evening:</p>
<p>6:30 pm Guests arrive/mix and mingle, YOU proceed to the Gallery for the Chef Circle Pre-Reception with Tony, special guest chefs and Chef Circle contributors</p>
<p>6:45pm YOU move to kitchen and Tony welcomes guests to his home and introduces the chefs and YOU </p>
<p>6:50pm YOU deliver brief remarks and open for questions from guests </p>
<p>7:15pm Tony calls last question </p>
<p>7:20pm Tony thanks guests and closes the program </p>
<p>7:45pm Program concludes – mix/mingle</p>
<p>Note that Terry McCauliffes wife is mentioned. This Chef Circle is something. She's one of them along with Alefantis.  </p>
<p>need to research this more.  </p>
<p>Note that there are 90 guests! Makes me wonder just how wide spread and acceptable this weird, voodoo? activity is in DC?</p></p>

<p><p>It's not supposed to be a dinner, just a fundraising event where they take some questions and then close. So the schedule would make sense. The chefs were told to get there "extra early," at around 4 PM, so what seems to have happened is they made some small food to pass around or have available for picking for the guests. </p></p>

<p><p>I'm not ruling out this explanation. I'm really not.  But with all the other strange, dark and twisted connections to Alefantis, comet pizza, Abramovic and more, I'm unwilling to rule out that it is much more than that.  I think too much points to a continuation of the spirit cooking ritual taught them by Abramovic and practiced at gatherings like this and in the underground spaces beneath comet on evenings leading up to Obamas election- October 2, 2008. https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/58301</p>
<p>And more. </p></p>

<p>I've done some looking into expanding the web. I don't think my post has got enough eyes. I'd urge you to take a look.</p>

<p><p>Robert Russo</p>

<p>Those are 2 names that show up at the bottom of the file when you view it in a TXT/HEX editor... but they aren't included in the actual readable part of the doc. </p>
