        <strong>Confusing the Andrew Klines</strong>
        <p><p>There are a number of comments in these threads attempting to clarify that there may be two Andrew Klines - one at DoJ and somebody associated with Besta Pizza.  If they're not the same person we need to fix this perception.</p>
<p>from https://redd.it/5dr69d</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is Andrew Kline of the DOJ -

This is the Andrew Kline who represented the owners of Besta Pizza -

Theyâ€™re not the same person.</p>

        <p><p>Good post.    Don't need wrong information continuing to circulate on this thread.    Decreases validity.</p></p>

<p>Nope. Initial investigator just googled "Andrew Kline" and went with whatever information he found first.</p>
<p>The LLC filing paperwork filed under the address for Besta Pizza (supposedly formerly Uptown Pizza) includes an address. That address is only associated with one specific Andrew Kline who works at the Veritas Law Firm, and seemingly one or two other companies operating from that same address. The Law firm website include a photo of this Andrew Kline.</p>
<p>He is a completely different "Andrew Kline" from the one that worked at the DOJ, who looks completely different and has a different educational and employment background.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that there are 3 other individuals named "Andrew Kline" within a 20 mile radius of Washington D.C. It's not that unique of a name.</p></p>
