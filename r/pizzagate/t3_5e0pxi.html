        <p><p>A celebrity who works for Fox News is giving advice for child predators on how to evade capture while using pizza references and this doesn't seem like any further evidence that there is something suspicious going on to you??? </p></p>

        <p><p>He was trying to be funny and failed miserably.  Nothing more.  The pizza delivery part is a prop in the joke.. it wouldn't have made any sense if he was delivering milk and cookies right?  Come on... you are obviously a troll if you think this is actually hinting at something real.</p></p>

        <p><p>Maybe maybe not. Small cheese pizza could be because he's admittedly a cheapskate. It is strange that it came up in Chris Hansen talk though.</p></p>

        <p><p>He is a comedian on the Tom Green show making a joke, depicting pedophiles as idiots at the same time for not taking any precautions at all for something so blatantly unacceptably by the public. Teenager me probably would have chuckled at this and thought nothing of it. Alcohol is also involved. This is just a famous person who happened to say "cheese pizza" to me in this context. Now if this is a routine thing that Adam talks about, maybe it could be something, but this is not enough on its own. I listened to him on the radio a lot growing up, and know that he is a huge clown, so take this with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>I'd like to add that I am very committed to being a digger myself, and have already tried to contribute. Keep digging friend. Maybe this leads to something, maybe not, but thank you for being aware and active!</p></p>

        <p><p>Now we are talking. He did seem a little caught off guard there, like everyone thought it was funny, 'ol adam giving everyone a laugh. But he did look really paranoid and drove off in a hurry. This is more solid than the first one with Tom.</p></p>

        <p><p>There is a Hansen post. Check it. </p>
<p>Can someone find/check this video, the channel is deleted. The title is 'Bloodborne: Pizzacutter'. With a disturbing image. I found it in search results on YT. Hope it's nothing.</p>
<p>Okay... what now?

        <p><p>Also we can't forget that Carolla works for Fox News which also employs General Paul E. Vallely as their chief military analyst.  This is the same General Vallely who co-wrote a paper in the 80's on how to use mind control techniques in warfare alongside Lt. Col. Michael Aquino, a high ranking Satanist and PSYOP specialist. There was that big child sex abuse scandal involving Aquino and other top ranking individuals at the Presidio Army Base back in the 80s, I believe. I'm not stating for a fact that it all ties together, but it is something to think about. The rabbit hole runs pretty deep.....</p>
