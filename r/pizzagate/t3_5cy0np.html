        <p><p>I don't see the connection to pizzagate. Please elaborate.</p></p>

        <p><p>I figured that since she promoted Wikileaks and that pizzagate is a consequence of Wikileaks that it was relevant. Should I delete? </p></p>

        <p><p>I'm going to lock it and leave it in place despite it not being tied to pizzagate directly. Unless there is a connection posited or a conclusion drawn, this is clutter. (The moderators are aware of concerns over the moderation of this sub regarding transparency/infiltration/etc. Leaving this here may help that. I can't guarantee someone else won't remove it-- and that's fine.)</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah PBS is a big part of this whole thing, I'm sure she was assassinated. Look at our good friend Gary Johnson https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cvzq9kOVMAAZr1H.jpg, he's part of the act too!</p></p>
