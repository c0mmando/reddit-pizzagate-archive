<strong>Stumbling into this Sub</strong>
<p><p>So basically, I stumbled upon this sub early this morning, and couldn't help but getting lost in every thread. But now I'm really shaken up. I'm literally sick to my stomach! I haven't been able to enjoy anything the entire day... I see celebrities on TV, and can't help but to wonder if they are involved in this horrible shit. I feel so scared for my family. What is this world coming to? I feel depressed about this crap.. I just had to vent. 
Thank you for reading. </p></p>

<p><p>And I'm sure there will be people that think that we are "conspiracy nuts" for finding truth in this. That's the sad part.. </p></p>

<p><p>same here, I posted about whats happening and linked to this subreddit on Instagram a few times today and people were blown out of their fucking minds, one dude thanked me for linking him. but i feel the same way you do. I told my mom about it and she can't wait to look at it at work tomorrow, so I had to advise her it would probably ruin her day lol</p></p>

<p><p>Seriously! It ruined my day completely. The only good that came from it was I hugged my kid a little tighter, and made me realize that this really is a sick world. How does someone get so fucked up in the head. It makes me so angry...I hate it. I feel crazy.</p></p>

<p><p>I hate it even more because every celebrity seems to be supporting Hillary without knowing about this so its like i know about a secret i can't get anyone to believe. I went to r/aww and that helped a bit haha </p></p>

<p><p>I tried going to subs that usually put a smile in my face, but couldn't enjoy anything. It's upsetting to think that maybe there are celebrities that DO know about this disgusting shit, and turn a blind eye. It's just overwhelming. </p></p>

<p><p>It's awwwwright, get right with God and ride the coat tails of a Trump victory into the halls of justice! Get out of here and have a cup of tea, play with an animal. I consider myself to be immune to this sort of stuff but the Dutroux affair and spirit cooking started to have serious effects on my mental health!</p></p>

<p><p>It'll be okay. Just take a moment, breathe, and remind yourself that none of you are real and the whole world is just a figment of my imagination.</p></p>
