   <strong>
    Casa Podesta Pizza Party?
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Not sure if this has been posted here, I'm new to this whole pizza gate thing, and just started digging
   </p>
   <p>
    https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5716
   </p>
   <p>
    Found this which is interesting:
   </p>
   <p>
    Note: attachments show the "spirit of the evening... on different levels"
   </p>
   <p>
    The attachments are bizarre pictures that appear to be Tony Podesta and a seemingly Catholic figure.
   </p>
   <p>
    Any idea what this means?

     Yeah the face in the pope as well as him rubbing his hands together in addition to the blatant reference to the multiple "spirits of the evening" is telling especially with the Catholic Church's association with pedophilia

    The Podestas are jesuits. Jesuits answer to the black pope. The Black Pope carries out the Roman Catholic agenda internationally. Search Podesta WikiLeaks for "Jesuit" then "knights of Malta"
   </p>
   <p>
    The current Pope, Mr. "Cool Old Man Francis" is actually the first ever Jesuit pope. He answers to the black pope as well. The Black Pope rules the world by proxy and the Vatican controls the world bank. There's a reason most people know nothing about the Vatican aside from the fact that it's "some catholic thing in some other country." It's actually the Remnants of the Holy Roman Empire, the people that own the United States.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Knights of Malta/Jesuits/Hospitallers are all involved in Haiti and were there the same time the Clinton Foundation was there. The jesuits also run a
    <em>
     fuck ton
    </em>
    of international "child protection" organizations, which makes it pretty clear to me who has the easiest access to untraceable kids ripe for abduction and ready to be sold to the Clinton Foundation which is a Vatican front for illegal activities. Look deep into this and you'll find your answers.
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit: go through my comment history for links and shit, the Pope himself has been implicated in child trafficking multiple times but the media is controlled by jesuits and you'll never hear about it

     Donald Trump went to a Jesuit university for two years.

      You're right and all of the people he's been rumored to be filling out his cabinet with are also pretty much all jesuits. Which means people need to be extremely weary of Donald Trump. The only reason for anyone to be surrounded by that many jesuits is quite obvious, unfortunately. Paul Ryan, the speaker of the house, is a Jesuit as well. The whole government is full of them and jesuits make up basically the entirety of the CIA. This stuff goes very deep
