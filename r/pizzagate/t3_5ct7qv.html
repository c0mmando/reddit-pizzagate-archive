        <p><p>I'm putting this at the top until we can figure out what the fuck is going on. Either /r/conspiracy is totally compromised with shills and/or nutters, or ... wtf?</p></p>

        <p><p>True. The archive.org thing is definitely an issue. I cannot confirm the archive.is - we don't have the /pol thread. I'm banned from /r/conspiracy, perhaps you can chase this down.</p>
<p>And yes /r/conspiracy is heavily compromised. But still good ppl there too.</p>
<p>It's <em>POSSIBLE</em> this is just a disruption tactic, in which case I humbly apologize.</p></p>

        <p><p>I knew this would happen. I'm gonna hijack this post like a tool. Ahem, the shills are going to start D&amp;C spam to turn us against each other. It will escalate into the moderators being banned and deleted (no lie, happened to cismaelstrom). After that they plant bait to trigger the subscribers, agitating them and getting them rowdy. Next they edit the bait comments to make themselves look innocent. Finally when you are foaming at the mouth and turning on each other by their bait &amp; switch they formally petition for control of the subreddit, arguing that the sub is going nuts and has no leader. This is exactly what they did to the /r/MensRights subreddit years ago, which failed and led to the selfpost copy bot. Quite recently /r/european where it succeeded, and the sub was (((quaranteened))). Next it graced /r/the_donald (which led to mr_trump). Once the shills create the consensus that your sub is compromised you will naturally split into another subreddit, which they also control. Then you are unwittingly pitted against each other in an information warfare sandbox.</p>
<p>Nobody listens. Nobody learns. I knew this would happen. This is related to the article because if they can shill the consensus that archives are (((archived))) then the quality of our investigation material will become utter shit. Until you figure it out, and regardless <strong>from now on, print the archived page to PDF.</strong> Use a printer executable our web based client that captures images et cetera with formatting. Those PDF files can be used as evidence. A screenshot cannot. If you are tricked into using screenshots they will shill fake screenshots then use these to discredit your investigation. This drama will set you back enough for them to gain turn advantage over you.</p></p>

        <p><p>I made a private sub with him and his mods after he got threatened because of "personal Information". (Though anybody couldve googled it. The goal is to invite trustworthy people that have contributed to this sub. Honestly its a bit of a mess over here, though it has gotten better already.</p>
<p>He told me that he needed a break from all this for a few days.</p></p>

<p>These are the compromised mods IMHO:</p>
<p>mr_dong (45612) slyly evil</p>
<p>axolotl_peyotl (334485) this guy plays the good guy</p>
<p>Ambiguously_Ironic (14) might be ok</p>
<p>SovereignMan (149096) evil</p>
<p>TheGhostOfDusty (30113) main asshole</p>
<p>Sabremesh (38403) evil</p>
<p>AssuredlyAThrowAway (221189) assuredly evil</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm part of their secret modmail groups. They invite certain popular users to private subreddits, make them all mods, and don't use the actual subreddit but communicate through the modmail. They try to formulate consensus this way.</p>
<p>This is a job for these people, they work longer than 5-9 jobs and are active all day. </p></p>

        <p><p>Do you have any proof of this? From looking at his comment history, he looks only moderately active.  I see in one of his comments he says he is only actively modding 4 subs.  Maybe he doesn't have a job.  I'm just not seeing any reason to assume he's a shill.</p></p>

        <p><p>You're not even trying shill-ho. He's modding 72 subreddits. And yes, of course, they don't leave many public comments. That's why they use the modmail of private subreddits to communicate.</p>
<p>And yes, I've been compiling evidence for years. But I'm not giving away the accounts that are collecting info for me. So yes, you and your kind will be going to jail.</p></p>

<p>I'm really wondering whether YOU might be a shill trying to stir up division.  You claim to have all this "evidence" about a mod, but you can't share it?  How convenient!</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah conspiracy has been compromised since the election. I posted a really good conspiracy post and it was downvoted to Oblivion and flamed.</p>
<p>Reddit is too compromised we need a new place to go.</p></p>

        <p><p>I tried last week.  They're shits buggy.  Never went back and tried again.</p>
<p>But it's a great place.  Minimal fuckery.  Advertise your spot in v/thedonald so we know it exists.  Stuff stays on the front page for over a day there so it might be perfect.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yea, I noticed all day today that archive.is links would intermittently stop working, but then they would work again several minutes later. I just checked and all of the archive.is pages I linked are still fine. So it may be compromised, or they may be overloaded with all of the additional archiving happening... we don't know for sure. But it is a good idea for us to have a backup plan just in case - we can't lose any evidence in addition to what's already being wiped off people's websites.</p></p>

        <p><p>Unless we create a VERY restricted community somewhere, anywhere we collect information/discuss this is going to be compromised. If the whole thing is real, then some of the most powerful people in the world will make absolutely certain they know everything that's going on with the research.</p></p>

        <p><p>I would recommend finding people locally who you can sit with and/or exchange messages using Signal messenger or USB stick.</p>
<p>We can build a trust network (which is what you need to create a restricted community) but I think the best way to start is with local connections. I have a few and we are working together. If others do as well, we'll set up a post and start co-ordinating those groups together into a remote restricted community.</p></p>

        <p><p>People. act as though any day now there is going to be an internet shutdown for a month and when it comes back on whatever we have managed to save is what is left.  Make no mistake the machine is coming here.  I recommend we all go to the links we each posted as archive links and screenshot them.  Screenshot and save to USB.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Whole internet is compromised including google, the entire point of mkultra was to control every form of input, tor isn't any safer lol. Read my red-pill history if you want I've been doing a lot of digging. One of the final tests of mkultra was to create the "mandala" effect where we believe Google even over our own collective memories. Look up the Mandala effect it's all made up by the CIA, remember the Berenstein Bears, there are so much more mental games going on and it goes so much deeper than we ever imagined. Shit is absolutely crazy.</p></p>

        <p><p>About the CIA angle in the Mandela effect, are you saying they manipulated our memories?  Because I thiught it was "-stein" until i went back and looked at old copies. It creeped me out because i remember explicitly trying to figure out if it was pronounced "stine" or "steen .</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm very interested in all this stuff, but I usually don't have much time to read up on it ("this stuff" and "it" being general conspiracy material...and especially this new pizzagate international pedo-ring info)..so I'm not sure about some of the stuff you just said. Would you give me a brief explanation of what "mkultra" is? If not...is there something I could listen to while working to get the info? EDIT: also possibly how that relates to the mandala effect</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah I've been digging in too much, gotta get back to work this week lol. Basically what I've determined is that we've all been under an MKUltra "thought-control" experiment for decades. It was a secret CIA project that they pretended to end in the 60's which involved a lot of LSD experimentation and hypnosis. I'm pretty sure the Mandala effect was one of the final goals of entirely controlling the "reading/writing" of our thoughts which allows them to maintain a complete shroud of secrecy. Google is all a part of it so it's difficult to research, google is another disinformation component of the experiment. I'm not even sure if "time" was a concept before all of this, a big part of it was to drill into the masses the false concept of "linear" time.</p></p>

<p>This isn't actually what happens behind the scenes. All the data is kept it just becomes inaccessible to the public, I've spoken with staff there before. I've also seen sites remove an exclusion from a robots.txt and all the pages become accessible again.</p>
<p>Archive.org isn't great for sites that utilize a lot of Javascript due to the way it saves dynamic pages, which is probably why the OP was experiencing issues with loading. I've tried other Instagram accounts and have seen the same thing.</p>
<p>Haven't experienced any issues with archive.is. The webmaster can be contacted anonymously, he runs a Q&amp;A style blog on the site. There's no evidence anything is compromised atm. Still a good idea to keep local copies of pages.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm surprised honestly; I've found all kinds of incriminating stuff on archive.org. But I guess all good things must come to an end.</p></p>

        <p><p>I was concerned about this before. I've been sending to Archive.is and also using a great built in screen capture addon called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/abduction/?src=search">Abduction</a>. </p>
<p>Everyone can also use the PrtSc/Print Screen button on their keyboard if it still has it. After pressing this button, load whatever iamge editing program you prefer (Paint works if nothing else) and Ctrl-V to paste the image and then save it.</p></p>

        <p><p>What if we all save our research, and periodically yet strategically, all dump at once to here, and wherever else, to share what we have found. We can do a quick save to our usbs print, or whatever before it gets wiped.</p>
<p>The other option is leaving clues to a place in the forest under a rock. Fuck, Idk.</p></p>

        <p><p>It doesn't appear to be compromised in any way I've seen. Its just a screen capture addon to save an image of a webpage to your local storage of choice.</p></p>

        <p><p>yeah that was to be expected</p>
<p>you can also expect all your free speech sleuthing sites to get shut down pretty soon if you keep this going</p>
<p>the chans, the subreddits, everything is highly volatile</p>
<p>you are hitting at the top, at the root of evil on this earth, and when they react you better have prepped contingency plans</p>
<p>i'd look to alternate, decentralized (peer to peer maybe) internet discussion options</p>

        <p><p>I noticed today that the archive website kept going down then coming back up. (Archive.is links). The same error as others described. </p>
<p>Thought it was weird, but maybe it's possible they're just getting more traffic than normal, like an accidental ddos? I'm not sure how often the site is used, but pizza gate is the most I've seen it being used. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah that was my second thought. My first thought was they just straight up infiltrated the website's domain/server. </p>
<p>If it doesn't come back, or if it does and all the archives are gone/broken, then that is pretty much 100% validation of the evidence. </p></p>

        <p><p>This may be a wild suggestion, but it may be worthwhile to start looking into using video/image hosting websites that are beyond the English-speaking Internet. If anyone knows of say, good Russian/Chinese/Japanese/Korean sites that are capable of doing similar things as archive.is, it could be another backup just in case.</p></p>

        <p><ol>
<li>
<p>archive.org does that with all instagram pages. Nothing fishy is going on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After archiving a page with archive.is, you can download a zip file of that page. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, it'd be easy for someone to alter a zipped file, so in the event a page is removed from archive.is, the archived version will be suspect.  Maybe start a thread here where several people download the archive directly from the source &amp; post the sha1 checksum.</p>
</li>
</ol></p>

        <p><p>For example:</p>
<hr>
<p>URL: http://archive.is/dFoRq</p>
<p>Link to download zip: http://archive.is/download/dFoRq.zip</p>
<p>someguy@somemachine:~/Downloads$ sha1sum ./dFoRq.zip </p>
<p>d4986dd33058b851324500950fc061f359d2ab04  ./dFoRq.zip</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, if several other people confirm this checksum value, if that page is removed by archive.is in the future, we'll have some level of trust that the zip file is unaltered. </p></p>

        <p><p>When you start organizing and gathering everything that you have, someone PM me. I saved a fuckton of the comet 4ch threads on disk. Maybe like 1-12? But I didn't bother making file names, and have been saving the shit out of a lotta stuff. I'd just dump otherwise. Anyways I'll probably forget when I do have time, so pm me if you are still missing shit when you read this. </p></p>

        <p><p>I had this issue a few days before the election.. Couldn't archive things properly and got worried.  Service seemed to be back to normal within a day though.</p>
<p>Could this possibly just be a denial of service attack?  If not then I may need to look into creating an alternative, assuming there is not one out there that fits our needs already.</p></p>

        <p><p>Guys relax, the archive.org links of his instagram have always been this way, ever since day one (I should know I was the first to archive many of his pictures).</p>
<p>Apparently the issue is with instagram, there must be some script loading instagram pages that doesn't get correctly executed through archive.org</p></p>
