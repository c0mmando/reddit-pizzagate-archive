        <p><p>Personally, I'm way too lazy to bother with this. There's bigger fish to fry. Whoever truly wants to know, will know. The sticky is a great start, and you can always ask questions if you're not sure about something.</p>
<p>A wiki would be a great help, though, should the mods be willing.</p></p>

        <p><p>No "someone" cannot. Software development is time consuming and requires expertise and learned skills. </p>
<p>I've been working on this problem (collaborative investigative software) and its not easy. The big boys have stuff (I've worked on it) but it's created by specialist multi million dollar companies rammed with  oxbridge grads </p></p>

        <p><p>Do a simple Post on this Thread call it "Timeline,updated daily. Please Help by commenting brief summary of any pizza-related event with a timestamp" &amp; ask mod to make it sticky.</p>
<p>If you ask ppl to begin with a timestamp with a given format (for example dd/mm/yyyy) its easy to get it with for example Python from your Post&amp;visualise it then. If you do this work for the post (means making it and collecting relevant events in the OP by copy&amp;paste) and maintain it for some time I'll help ;) </p>
<p>give an example of a comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(01/01/2017)Alefakis buys building </p>
</blockquote></p>

        <p><p>If you do this I also recommend to give our actors unique, correctly spelled names in the post for more profit of that timeline. (e.g.always refer to john podesta as jpodesta - (not podesta or john or he)) </p></p>
