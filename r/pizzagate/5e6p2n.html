   <strong>
    TIES TO ANOTHER MISSING CHILD, BOY LOVE BOOK STORE, NAMBLA
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I've found yet more damning evidence of the DC pedophilia ring. Please review the information presented below.
   </p>
   <p>
    In Washington DC, on the SAME STREET as Comet Ping Pong, there was a gay book store called Lambda Rising:
   </p>
   <p>

   </p>
   <p>
    Lambda Rising was well known to stock pro-boy-love items. The Lambda symbol itself is a triangle, much like the "boy lover" symbol, much like the "Besta Pizza" logo, or any slice of pizza for that matter. In fact, Lambda Rising even stocked merchandise related to the disgusting group NAMBLA (North American Man Boy Love Association), as you can see here, they carried the "NAMBLA Bulletin":

   </p>
   <p>
    Another group related to this ring, and the Clintons is Lambda Legal (familiar name, isn't it?). Ostensibly a group meant as a legal aid to the LGBT community, it appears they do a lot of defense work for even more "questionable" sexual orientations. Some evidence of their ties to the Clinton administration, Podesta's CAP group (!), another "MAP" group, and NAMBLA:

   </p>
   <p>
    This requires more digging, but involves many high end people. The head of Lambda Legal is Mayor Bloomberg's Niece. Bloomberg endorsed Hillary and was a known associate of the infamous Jeffrey Epstein of the "sex slave island":

   </p>
   <p>
    In addition to this, there is correlation with this ring, especially Podesta, and the mysterious disappearance of the young Hoggle children. They went missing in the Gaithersburg/Bethesda area of MD, not far from the base of the DC pedo ring. Their mother has been unable to be questioned or state anything regarding her children because of her "mental state" and she keeps trying to "escape from a psychiatric hospital". Very questionable, and points toward certain mind control / traumatic mental conditioning used in MKULTRA programs and in other incidents tied to the Clintons.

    Same article on the Hoggles SEEN IN PODESTA'S EMAILS. Why? Should have nothing to do with him, right?

    A cryptic email about a "get together" with podesta, just before the Hoggles' disappearance on September 7, 2014. He readily agrees to it, despite there being no details:

    Another... strange... email from the same wabrams1@me.com. Something strange here between them. Interpret it how you will:

    I hope this information is useful to the investigation. We need to expose these sick freaks. More dumps may be coming.

    Oh hell no
   </p>
   <p>
    Did you read the full article on the missing children?
   </p>
   <p>
    The mothers said she left her children with someone named "Erin."
   </p>
   <p>
    The email to Podesta from wabrams1 before their disappearance includes someone named "Eryn"
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit to correct information: the email from wabrams1 is Wendy Abrams, a Chicago political activist. founder of a climate change organization, and mother of 4. This explains the bunk house comment. See other comments below, don't want to spread misinformation. Doesn't seem to be any connection to the missing kids. I still think we should keep digging for more info.

      Crazy find indeed.  One thing I'm trying to follow is how does this missing mothers case and this email wabrams1@me.com related to this bookstore?
     </p>
     <p>
      Is it at all?  It doesn't seem to be from what I can tell.  Which makes the connection here have little evidence unfortunately.

       The wabrams1 connection is with Podesta's emails and the Hoggle disappearances. The book store is a separate lead, unfortunately info there is sparse as it closed down a few years after Comet opened -- but it may have been another place like Comet, and may have closed because Comet opened up (and ebooks came to the fore) and made it inessential.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lambda Books is a considerable lead because it's related to Lambda Publishing and Lambda Legal, all of which are tied to boy-love information/defense. Plus, it was on the same street as Comet.

        Ok, yes I was just wondering if it was an entirely separate lead and indeed it is.  Nonetheless great work and good finds.

    September 7th is A satanic holiday according to this chart. On this day the holiday is marriage to the beast and involves the sacrifice of a female child.

        Even I would love to jump at the gun and say that it's what you think it is, but it's christmas eve.  People have cheeseballs and whatnot all the time around that time of year

         Yes that email is fishy. Why does he talk about playing dominoes on cheese vs pasta?
        </p>
        <p>
         But I don't want to jump to any conclusions. The tone of the email is pleasant like a random old grandpa sending an email to an old friend.

     We need to cross-check all of these holidays against the content of Podesta e-mails on those particular dates. I bet some sentences might acquire a new meaning. I have no doubt Podestas are satanists.

     Also worth noting the MajesticApe video (where she says "today we celebrate the birth of our lord," which I believe had a double meaning) was taken on 1.20 (the satanist holiday for worshiping Moloch). Just too many coincidences.

       It was posted on Vimeo and they removed it. Titled something like "1.20.12 MajesticApe Celebrates"

      Serious diggers aren't purposely ignoring their belief system. If you do, you're a joke.

        Not your beliefs,
        <em>
         their

        beliefs. The elite, which have literature and art which can't be dismissed if you want to understand them.

         Okay, well, according to you lot, I qualify as part of the "liberal elite" and I'd like to know exactly what my belief system is. Am we satanists? Have we got some sort of druid thing going on? What does the satanic calendar have anything to do with "the elite", of which I have been continuously told I am part of?

           You lot certainly are picky over who is an elite and who isn't, almost as if it's based entirely on arbitrary notions.

             "Homework" is the plural of "homework", and unless you're willing to provide at least a partially convincing reason for why I should actually give your conspiracy the time of day, I think we're done here. If I listened to every crackpot and nutjob with a theory, I'd never get anything done.

      If you want to deny that crimes do happen by people that follow a Satanic calendar that is up to you. But just like people sell their children because they believe it is an okay thing to do, or murder them because they think they are the cause of their misery, people kidnap, murder, and abuse children because they believe in their Satanic rituals.

       Of course, there are crazy people everywhere. What I do dispute is the, at
       <em>
        best
       </em>
       tenous, links between the "liberal elite", weird satanic rituals and NAMBLA based on emails that have nothing to do with either of those things. It's fucking ridiculous - I came here looking for empirical evidence of something big, and all I got was performance art. From an outsider perspective, it's like walking straight into a sub full of Alex Jones' - no logic, no perspective, just "connect the dots", where the dots can be reasonably explained by "people living their lives".

       You want an example of an actual child abuse/pornography coverup? The Westminster paedophile dossier - no CSI Miami acronyms, just clear-as-day written and historical evidence. Connecting
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       dots - "Why was the dossier not retained? What's the relevance of the National Archives reference? Do previous investigations, such as Jimmy Savile's, provide any historical context?".
       <em>
        Those
       </em>
       are dots,
       <em>

       </em>
       "MBLGPM = man boy love gay person monster",
       <em>

       </em>
       "John's brother really likes weird performance art!",

        This is all circumstantial evidence. Maybe upon further research it will be disproven. But that doesn't mean we should stop looking because one guy thinks it's stupid. If you have read the Podesta emails, you would know there are many mentions of satanic worship. This isn't out of nowhere.
       </p>
       <p>
        This missing kids case is fishy because they disappeared in the same area as the suspected ring, but mostly because the mother insists she gave her child to a friend (named Erin) and that her children are safe. And she keeps trying to escape from a maximum security psych ward. This strongly smells of selling her kids to some sort of trafficker. Is it weird that this happened on a satanic holiday? Yes it is.  Does it mean anything? Maybe, maybe not.
       </p>

        And this isn't published material. You are expecting us to have everything figured out and laid out for you. This is a group of random people coming to investigate. Either get out or contribute and stop whining.

        You can't walk in and read just a few threads. It's all the things we are finding (consistent occult references and connections) that are making us believe this is more Satanic based than just pedophilia. As if one is better than the other... If I were to explain why I believe some of these people are performing Satanic rituals it would be:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         Alefantis himself along with most of Comet pizza art/patrons have expressed interest in the art depicting Satanism
        </li>
        <li>
         Above people have connections with the whole spirit-cooking lady, who obviously believes her dark magic has power. Whether it does or doesn't isn't relevant, all that matters is she believes it does.
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Other suspicious pizza places people have brought up, such as Pelosi's Goat Head Pizza all have direct references to the occult. Obvious= "Goat Head", and borrowing from other posters here: "Five Point Pizza" I believe was one, which literally has upside-down Pentagrams and other things like that all throughout the store/on pizza boxes.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Important to think about is that the art that Podesta's love, and the art depicted on the Comet Pizza event posters are disturbing to say the least. It isn't just edgy, out-there art that's trying to be hip. The art is similar to that other artist (the female, some said she may have been abused, I can't remember her name but will add in once I go look) that depicted out-of-body experiences of children while they were being raped/tortured, children being strapped to wall by chest, the overall art style of blocks of color, people being devoid of much detail except height or size, and them carrying "wavy" sticks that past victims have described more as cattle prods.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Most connections made even through Comet's instagram or Twitter (or new leads) have Satanic shit on their personal accounts. That means followers, things the business posts, ect.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Satanic ritual abuse can be real, can be covered up, and can be done among the "elite." Consider how much privacy and money this would require. Only the rich would be able to do this for so long and get away with it. We already know that the media is under control, so if they were under control why would they expose anything that might give the public a hint of what is going on?
         </p>
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        Also many of us are looking at anyone involved, not just "liberals." This is not an extension of the Trump subreddit. Some of us came from other places, some of us are international, ect. Podesta just so happens to the one that sparked our awareness about something fishy going on because of his awkward usage of "pizza" and "pasta"

         Thank you for your much more measured reply. I'll take it into consideration, but I am personally wary of any subreddit that sounds like Infowars, no matter how much of it might be true (can't see the forest through the trees). Particularly theories that are formed like

    Guys... according to this post on Reddit, the last place Catherine was taking her son was to go get pizza.

     I also found this article that mentions the same thing. She took her son for pizza and returned without him.

     I've also seen references that the mother was a waitress. I can't do a lot of research now, but I wondered if that was worth looking into?

      It's possible.  The thing I find interesting is that she claims someone is trying to perform an exorcism on her.
     </p>
     <p>
      If satanism is real...could she not be possessed? That would explain her unusual behavior. This is pure speculation and I know that sounds insane, but honestly why else would she give her children away? She takes her son to pizza and returns without him. The next day the girl disappears. It's so bizarre. Her family says she's extremely intelligent and knows what's going on, but everyone else says she is behaving erratically. What if she got involved with satanists?

       Well, I don't think that she is possessed but may be religious and feels she needs to be possessed because she came in contact with people that perform these rituals. She may have been threatened or told that she had no choice. I can't imagine what would go on in a mother's head that would allow her to just hand over her child.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the things I could come up with scenario-wise if she did hand over her son:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         She actually did take him out to pizza but went into the wrong pizza place. This put her in contact with the people that prey on these children/parents. Before she left they made her aware that she had two choices, either give her son to them and they will pay her/assure he stays "safe" (something she probably knew to be false but denial/hysteria will make your thinking/reasoning blurry). Or she could not give him to them and they would make both of them disappear (both instantly killed) She gave him to them, convincing herself that he would be okay, and returned home.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She made contact with these people prior and planned to sell/give her child away to them. She behaved rationally around her family in order to avoid suspicion/concern. She gave her child away, came back home, then either wanted to start over new or couldn't bear with herself so she ran away/killed herself.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Variation of above, except that she actually got sucked into the cult herself and disappeared within the cult. Based on what research I've done on people that join cults, often they will appear to be doing nothing suspicious or out of the norm until one day they disappear/shut out their family/friends. It's only then that the closer people realize the person isn't okay. Strangers may notice more because she may not have cared what their opinion was.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

        The thing is though her son disappeared on sept 7th after supposedly taking him to get pizza. The next day was her daughter. That's what is so bizarre.

      Even the random commenters were guessing she sold her kids into slavery.

      They way she insists that the kids are with a friend and are safe.

     Also she had a tweet on September 7th, 2014 at some sort of farm. I can't read the sign but it looks like a strawberry picking farm

    Not sure if it has been mentioned before, but there is a large system of tunnels under the DC area.  Built just before and during WWII and continued throughout the cold war.  Politicians, aides and lobbyist used to travel on an underground railway from building to building.  Could  still be doing it today. These places could be all connected.  Imagine a connecting tunnel from the pizza joint to the gay store to the capital to where the fuck ever.  Kinda scary.

     Follow the tunnels, what other business are above them? 4chan guy made cryptic mention of The Children in the Shoe daycare - two daycare locations not far from Comet, just south. Is this place on the tunnel system?

         I've gone down some sort of tunnel rabbit hole and found that there was a huge WalMart controversy where they were apparently working with the Department of Homeland Security to build a tunnel system across the States.

         Here's some links:

      I've been in one...Nothing crazy, my uncle worked at high levels in the CIA/Pentagon. We got a tour of congress, the pentagon, etc., and that's how they took us from one place to another. So I'm saying they do exist....And that only makes sense.

     I posted around an hour ago about how the office of the contractor the Clinton's used to do the shady reno's on the new house they bought in NY is located 3 mins drive from Comet Ping Pong right across the street from the Tenleytown - AU Station. There is also a freemason lodge in the same building.
    </p>
    <p>
     The contractor is called Carl Petty Associates. You can see sources and some fishy stuff I found on the pizzeria located up the street from there right above subway line in my post here:

    </p>
    <p>
     I read that President Eisenhower created a secret rail planning commission that directed the development of a secondary secret underground rail system built alongside the public one.
    </p>
    <p>
     So maybe that contractor is above the secret one....time to follow the subway!!!

     There's pictures floating around here somewhere of the tunnels. It just so happens there's an old abandoned Pizza Express down there sitting down there all by itself. Very eerie!

    A "bunk house" is a term for any rv with a back room that has bunk beds, usually 2 or 4. Weird that it's the body of this email. Was the disappearance of these children on a boat? I wonder if boats also can be called a bunk house. Either way, it's related to camping and strongly associated with kids

      LOL excellent smack down. I've been distracted by my Twittergate trauma today so counting on ya'll excellent to sift the wheat from the chaff. I absolutely believe that there's an effort to make it look like pizzagate is much ado about nothing so doing that sort of stuff you just did...is what makes this place work. Thanks!

     Catherine refers to "Erin" as a high school friend. I'm trying to figure out what high school she went to. And who is this "Eryn" that Podesta is emailing about?
    </p>
    <p>
     She mentions going to take her son Jacob to get pizza- when she came back, he was gone. Is it possible she took him to Comet and left her kids there with this Eryn?
    </p>
    <p>
     Edit- no connection that I can find. The Eryn in the email is some sort of Secretary. So far I haven't been able to find out much about Catherine and the "Erin" she is talking about. The email from Wabrams is Wendy Abrams, founder of "Know Tomorrow," a climate change organization. There doesn't seem to be any connection between the kidnapping and these emails. The blood moon refers to an eclipse that was coming up.

      Where there's smoke...there's fire. Coincidence? What if the mom was drugged...the old crazy train is fast easy way to shut her up and dispose of her...
     </p>
     <p>
      I cannot think of any logical reason they are emailing about this..and the name correlation bears looking at.
     </p>
     <p>
      This could be sheer bad luck for Podesta...sure...it's nothing...well I'd say Podesta has had a whole lot of the same kind of bad luck.

        Maybe the Catherine lady lied about her being a high school friend and just gave her name. Like she wanted to claim it was a friend to make he seem less sketchy.

    In regards to the lambda part, 'Lambda' is a included in a lot of LGBT stuff. For instance Universities can often have a 'Lambda Alliance' where they do LGBT support stuff.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not doubting any of the other potential leads, just saying 'Lambda' is LGBT stuff is pretty common.

     Eleven-year-old Patrick was last seen last seen near The Pizza Chalet on Foothill and Euclid Streets in Upland, California on January 20, 1988 at 9:00pm.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      He apparently spent time in the pizza parlor playing video games with an unidentified juvenile before leaving.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Patrick was reportedly seen leaving with the same unidentified juvenile that he was with in the pizza parlor.
     </strong>
     He told his mother that he was going to a basketball game with a friend at Upland High School. There was a basketball game that night, but it was in Chino, not in Upland.
    </p>
    <p>
     Patrick's parents waited for him all night, but he never came home. He was reported missing the next morning. The Pizza Chalet has since moved to another location after Patrick's disappearance. His case remains unsolved and he hasn't been seen since.
    </p>
    <p>
     Patrick was last seen wearing a gray shirt, gray pants, and white shoes when he disappeared. He has a skin discoloration on his left jawline near his chin.

    I got something you'll like, EPIC post btw
   </p>
   <p>
    so you'd think lambda is just a greek letter, right? you'd be wrong
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     According to Herodotus, Labda (Greek: Λάβδα) was a daughter of the Bacchiad Amphion, and mother of Cypselus, by Eetion.[1] Her name was derived from the fact of her feet being turned outward, and thus resembling the letter lambda (Λ),[2] which, by the accounts of the most ancient Greek grammarians, was originally pronounced labda [labda].
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    lambda is some (pseudo?)mythological figure with little direct info, but one layer deeper &amp; oooh ho ho does the shit pile higher:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     son Cypselus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypselus
    </li>
   </ul>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     was the
     <strong>
      first tyrant
     </strong>
     of Corinth
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Like the signori of late medieval and Renaissance Italy, the tyrants usually seized power at the head of some popular support. Often the
      <em>
       tyrants
      </em>
      upheld existing laws and customs and were highly conservative as to
      <strong>
       cult practices
      </strong>
      , thus maintaining stability with little risk to their own personal security. As in Renaissance Italy, a
      <em>
       cult of personality naturally
      </em>
      <strong>
       substituted
      </strong>
      for the divine right of the
      <strong>
       former legitimate
      </strong>
      royal house.
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     he fulfilled the prophecy.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      the Bacchiadae heard two prophecies from the Delphic oracle that the son of Eëtion would overthrow their dynasty, and
      <strong>
       they planned to kill the baby
      </strong>
      once it was born
     </p>
    </blockquote>

    How can the journalists still not see a story here? Each one of these connections are more groundbreaking than other, doesn't even have to talk about the whole thing's map. I am going more insane as i keep reading this stuff while the public is still ignorant. Please if any of these are true, DON'T let them get away

     Yeah, I don't know anything about 4chan and don't use twitter anymore, so if anyone wants to crosspost this it would be helpful.

    There's a couple of things that should be pointed out.
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     <p>
      The article about Hoggle looks like it's included in a generic email with other news articles from the same site. All Washington Post. Which to me means it's just a coincidence as the email sender is the Washington Post. It's just a top news article email guys.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      There was a blood moon right around the time that she mentions blood moon in the email. Which is what I'm sure she's alluding to as opposed to something satanic: https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/facts-lunar-eclipse.html
     </p>
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    This is grasping for straws a bit guys.

     Yeah after looking over everything and giving myself some distance I'm pretty sure this lady named Wendy who founded a climate change activist group (probably with good ole George) is just trying to meet up with her pal John. I don't see the connection to the Hoggles.
    </p>
    <p>
     But. I still think the missing kids case could be connected to human trafficking. Just not from these emails.

    People need to wake up and see that the LGBT agenda is just a guise for Nambla. It's a known fact that Homosexuality is synonymous with Pedophilia. Political correctness changed this but parents need to be reminded that the depraved homosexual mind knows no bounds (some, maybe) but yea, these people are dangerous. The old timers knew best https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAw0OnvuQ7Y

    Lambda is a greek letter, that doesn't make the greeks culpable. I see so many topics here, not sure what you're trying to say. There are a lot of missing kids in the NE part of the USA, but that doesn't mean that the Clintons did them.

      The kind of illogical leaps made by OP in this thread hurt #pizzagate's credibility.
