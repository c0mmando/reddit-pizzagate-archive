        <strong>Herman Caine and Godfather's Pizza</strong>
        <p><p>I'm not a sleuth or anything, but I thought it might be worth looking into this connection a little more. I mean, the dude was a legitimate presidential nominee who used to be the CEO of a pizza franchise (pizza seeming to be all the rage right now with symbols). His campaign was also derailed with sexual harassment complaints. I don't want to suggest he's part of it or anything, but I feel like a  connections made to him would be very strange given the fact that he was so closely involved with pizza for such a long time and seemingly went straight from the pizza industry to working in D.C.</p></p>
