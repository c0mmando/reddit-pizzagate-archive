        <p><p>Disturbing and deflating. It really is a sad story of the powers that be suffocating the entire case, the FBI being one of the primary players in that way back in the early 90s. We have perhaps already seen the FBI disrupt the investigation this time when they reopened the E-mail investigation so they could confiscate the evidence the NYPD had from Weiners Laptop, a known pedophile. Hopefully with more eyes open to this, the FBI will be forced to act above board this time.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's honestly scary how little oversight agencies such as FBI and CIA have.</p></p>
