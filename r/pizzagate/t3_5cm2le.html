        <strong>Person running Pizzagate IG account!</strong>
        <p><p>Bro what the actual fuck are you doing!? Your harrassment and your over the top "Dramatic Investigative Journalism" just cost me some heavy details. I was added as a friend onto these private IG accounts which allowed me to continue to provide useful information to the cause. I have now been unfollowed and blocked from these accounts  because of your vulgar comments and attacks on these people. If you want to be so in tuned on the fine print, don't be a hypocrite; innocent until proven guilty. Learn to control your ego and emotions and focus on what is in front of you. Gather intel on your own and keep quit FFS!  Now just been blocked by Comet Ping Pong! Wow!  Anyone know who this individual is, let them know they are actively hindering any new results!</p></p>

        <p><p>If you are going to dig this deep into a rabithole, fully expect to be fucked with. This is going to turn into a storm of damning evidence, tinfoil reaching, disinfo and fake finds. </p>
<p>Joining a dig group doesn't mean anything if you have no clue who is running it. Post publicly and find something bad and you could be found out. It's a tricky thing. </p></p>

        <p><p>I hope the people doing this seriously are doing it in threads that aren't public.</p>
<p>This is great to keep the people up to date, but we are also getting a lot of disinformation as well.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't think it's on purpose. If they were on these people's side, they would just DM them. </p>
<p>OP is right, this idiot thinks harassing them is a good idea and its really, really stupid. Probably watched too many cop shows where the bad guy gives up all the details after a second of interrogation.</p>
<p>If they're guilty, it's definitely fucking things up, and if they're innocent people with lots of coincedences then it makes it more difficult to cross them off the list, so to speak, and makes everyone waste their time on ultimate dead ends. Either way, that fucktard needs to stop.</p></p>

        <p><p>Exactly they probably moved whatever they had evidence wise out of there by now. I've been watching this unfold for a week in a half. The scum has to know. </p>
<p>Need to maybe stay a step ahead of them. If they did move evidence they need to set up shop somewhere else. However, i bet it's still within area of comet. </p>
<p>They wouldn't want to hurt there "clientele"</p></p>

        <p><p>100% certain this was done intentionally. There are a ton of people who never comment or post to this sub jamming it up with nonsense posts and political bait since right after the election.</p>
<p>Its easy to make an insta account and attack people who are quietly under review so they'll either delete their account or make it private. </p>
<p>I sense we are getting close because substantive posts that are well written and contain new info are bouncing up and down with upvotes. (And who the hell is downvoting posts that are trying to help save abused children?)</p></p>
