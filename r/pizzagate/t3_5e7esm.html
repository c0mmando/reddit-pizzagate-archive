        <p><p>They need to understand that Trump supporters like myself expect that r/the_donald to bring r/pizzagate to Trumps attention.  You can't tell me all campaign he reads and listens to us but when this scandal happens you can't help us all shout if from the roof tops?  If it's not shady, it's lazy</p></p>

        <p><p>It was weird cause PizzaGate was starting to take off on The_Donald
I'd see threads all the time, then election day happened, I saw a few threads like "We need to go full swing on the pizza angle after the election is over." or similar threads and now I don't see anything about it. </p></p>

        <p><p>I was banned for mentioning Pizzagate in 2 different threads when it was "breaking out." They said I was spamming and perma-banned me from the_donald. How the fuck is talking about something 2 times "spamming?"</p>
<p>Since then, I have not trusted the mods. I don't know if it's compromised, but they are definitely playing shady games. Do not trust mods at the_donald.</p></p>

        <p><p>i completly agree that the_donald has been acting weird for a long while....BUT i will say one thing guys...the stuff we do here? if something goes wrong with doxxing...with spreading twitter info of CP predators etc...this sub can get shut down. rebuilding it? not too hard. rebuilding the donald with its 300k people? much harder. as long as we have this sub, once we get concrete stuff we can push it on the Donald. this sub began growing when Donald was at like what...270k? 250k? we have majority of aware people from there on here either way. besides once twittergate was confirmed it was pushed hard on the donald and not deleted. now we have multiple top hot threads on it. </p></p>

        <p><p>they reordered the mods due to head stepping down. This has happened at least 13 times in the last year.</p>
<p>I'm fine with their stance on this.</p>
<p>and they had an open registration for new mods a little bit ago...</p></p>

        <p><p>it was king something that was the head mod ~a month ago.</p>
<p>But they stepped down as they weren't a US voter or something.</p>
<p>and it's not change permissions, it's reording the structure.</p>
<p>in order for snap to be top mod, they would have to remove all the mods above snap first and since king was shifted to be top also they would've had to remove all above him and then reinvite etc... </p>
<p>a mod above you can't be banned. So they make sure they have a strong buffer of trusted mods on top and they swap it every now and then as new mods prove their mettle. The top mods have all been around since the beginning or close to.</p></p>

        <p><p>yeah I wouldn't doubt, nor do I disapprove. The only few who actually did wrong were outspoken people and since none of the mods do that I think they fully weed out the bad ones.</p>
<p>A lot of the drama was a misunderstanding (even the Milo incident) or poor execution.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm curious what the misunderstanding was with the Milo incident.</p>
<p>There are also some extremists on t_d, and then you have people coming in &amp; exploiting this to make the entire board look like ignorant bigots. Then when the mods shut it down to protect Trump's reputation and not chase away all his centrist supporters, the extremists freak out about free speech.</p>
<p>You couldn't pay me to mod over there.</p></p>

        <p><p>So Rich Guy oculus wants to start a PAC to put up memes on billboards. He contacts T_D Mods or Milo first, then they use Milo to vet him. Milo says he is up to snuff and isn't trolling.</p>
<p>T_D Mods contact Reddit Admins (it is required under the ToS that any outside job that can benefit from a mod rule must be disclosed and approved) so they emailed the head about it.</p>
<p>Head Guy ok'd their 501(c)(3) work.  (email was leaked and T_D people thought it was collusion with admins/mods zzzzz)</p>
<p>the timing issue:</p>
<p>Head guy starts an ama under a stupid username telling everyone he is rich!!! (to be fair he had Notch syndrome in that he got a lot of money fast) and wants to shitpost irl. Users understandably ask what the fuck? especially since it's an unknown and it was stickied.</p>
<p>Mods try to explain it... poorly. Milo tried to tell them he knows the guy and he is trustworthy but won't reveal it.</p>
<p>Later gets revealed he was the oculus guy meanwhile T_D users understandably don't trust rich millionaires+ who aren't transparent.</p>
<p>No one would've really benefited or 'stolen' money since a 501(c)(3) has strict limits on personal gain vs size of company and output. (plus mods had no nepotism ties like Clinton to grease palms) </p>
<p>the website was not finished and looked that way leading people to scream scam (understandably)</p>
<p>Then pitchforks and torches came out and you can't stop it. Milo's head rolled so did lil-z and a few others.</p>
<p>To be fair some mods tried to talk sense into Mods telling them they need to slowly discuss their plans to the userbase and not just drop it all at once, they should've taken heed.</p></p>

        <p><p>I was banned for mentioning anything that wasnt specifically about getting Trump elected. </p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure that I know what the role and goal of the sub is now but I've tried to learn from it.</p>
<p>PG has its own sub now so I go there to read and write about that. </p>
<p>Sorry you got banned or muted or whatever.  It always feels like a hard slap in the face that I wasn't expecting</p></p>

        <p><p>have your little reddit detective party here in /r/pizzagate, and if you find anything that remotely resembles actual evidence of illegal activity on the behalf of clinton/podesta/etc (and not just people talking about food) i'm sure the_donald will be glad to blow it up </p>
<p>the reality is that the proof just isn't there. all we can actually prove is that podesta has a passing interest in transgressive art, and that he sometimes discusses various foods via email. some of you have gone completely off the deep end (or were there already, posting about chemtrails and mind-control vaccinations in /r/conspiracy until this came along). as i understand it, users of this sub are deliberately downloading and uploading child porn on some half-baked goose chase. you are actually breaking the law</p>
<p>what was the upshot of that "2gb leak" megathread you had the other day? one clown tricked a bunch of other clowns into distributing CP with absolutely no proof that it had any link to any person connected to podesta/clinton other than his own unsupported testimony. that might fly here on /r/pizzagate, but i don't think /r/the_donald mods want to give /u/spez an excuse to delete their sub. can you imagine how /r/hillaryclinton and /r/srs would exult over the news item "/r/the_donald deleted for sharing cp"</p></p>

        <p><p>This is really it. It's fine to armchair it but evidence is needed, I've read through from the start and argued against bad tactics that were being used.</p>
<p>I think they are all eccentric and love the 'outside' culture (you see it a lot in hipster towns/hipster types) Bill Clinton almost assuredly had sex with a 16 year old or 15 he you can talk about with a measure of evidence. Podesta is all out of context emails.</p>
<p>The rest requires a confirmation bias. It's weird to some extent but we don't have context. Without context you can spin anything from anything.</p>
<p>Also with the NYT putting pressure on reddit to stop the harassment and the FBI looking into users passing CP around and harassing Ping-Pong employees if it is on T_D it would end up getting it shut down.</p></p>
