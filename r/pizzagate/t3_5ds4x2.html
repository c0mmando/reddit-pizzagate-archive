This ring had to do whit relegious schools and high standing officials.    <br>
Pro erdogan news paper picked up pizza gate story to show turkey see its happening in the usa its normal.   <br>
The marry the rape victim is an old Islamic practice </p></p>

        <p><p>I feel so bad for the sane, educated, and rational Turks that need to put up with the shitshow their country has become.</p>
<p>also, they should start on making sure they have a fast way of getting out of the country while they can, just in case.</p></p>

        <p><p>Remember that failed coup a few months back?</p>
<p>When you attempt to overthrow your government and fail, things don't get better. They get worse.</p>
<p>Turkey has been a shithole for a long time but it's about to go full Islamist and it's going to be ugly.</p></p>

        <p><p>This bill wasn't even passed and people associating this to Islam is plain stupid(rape=death penalty). </p>
<p>This is actually found in Deuteronomy:</p>
<p>"If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; 29 Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days"</p>
<p>And that verse also has a context.</p></p>
