    Everyone please look into Laura Silsby. She was caught in Haiti and jailed for trying to traffic 33 children and the first thing the Clinton Foundation did when they moved into Haiti was Hillary pardoned her, and she now creepily works on the board of directors for a company called AlertSense that is in charge of issuing amber alerts. https://www.alertsense.com/company/executive-team/ (Laura Silsby-Gayler)
   </p>
   <p>
    So basically, a woman who served time for trafficking kids in Haiti now sits on the board of a company that serves as the backbone for many local authorities when they want to issue Amber Alerts.
   </p>
   <p>
    WikiLeaks also retweeted this story confirming it's truth: https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794247777756860417
   </p>
   <p>
    WikiLeaks then confirmed Hillary has a LONG history with convicted child trafficker and kidnapper Laura Silsby, and Huma Abedin (vice chairwoman of Hillary's 2016 presidential campaign) has been forwarding emails about Laura Silsby's non government organization to Hillary for years.
   </p>
   <p>
    Laura Silsby was also former director of The New Life Children's Refuge, the same group that was busted by Haitian authorities trying to traffic kids:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case
   </p>
   <p>
    And the video below is about a bunch of Haitians protesting the evils of the Clintons, and the man protesting in the video mentions how the Clintons have exploited Haiti's resources for themselves, and even specifically mentions people in Haiti are afraid to go out at night because of  fear of kidnapping. (4:48 in the video)
   </p>

   </p>
   <p>
    At around the 2:00 mark he even mentions Tony Rodham (Hillary's brother) is now in charge of gold mines in Haiti and sits on the gold mine's board of directors.

    Many people are talking about this story, continue to spread the word!!
