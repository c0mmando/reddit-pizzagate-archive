<strong>Law Suits vs. Alefantis' Businesses - Need Digging - IMPORTANT</strong>
<p><p>I've been holding back this information due to confidentiality request from source.  However, now I think it's time to present this.  Perhaps an attorney or PI here can take a look and see if we can figure out more of what's going on with the law suits.  Read on...</p>
<p>If you look into the lawsuit records of James Alefantis (owner of Comet Ping Pong) what comes up is a suit filed by Devoya Robinson and her co owner of Boas 5 Star Elite Cleaners. Devoya Robinson runs this cleaning company. The suit claims "abuse of process". We believe there are previous legal filing filed by Alefantis against Robinson but they are currently sealed. (We have the files)</p>
<p>What we do know: Boas 5 Star Elite Cleaners was hired to clean Comet Ping Pong. Sometime in late 2011 something occurred that ended the business relationship but began a legal one.</p>
<p>The theory: Boas Cleaners either found something they weren't supposed to or got too close and Alefantis is tying them up legally or threatening their business with endless litigation. At which point Robinson lawyered up and fired back with the Abuse of Process suit which is exclusively used in tort law. It's also entirely possible that it was a business falling out that isn't nefarious but I would love to see the full court docs. But like I said sealed.
Turns out James Alefantis has a history of lawsuits under his other company Bucks Fishing. Including one with another cleaner as well as a AC/Plumber contractor based in DC</p>
<p>http://www.vitoservices.com/ contractors website</p>
<p>I also found out that the case with Devoya Robinson was very strange. It looks like she got out lawyered. She present her case and a judge ordered a summons. Alefantis lawyer immediately filed to dismiss the case. The case proceeded but it appears that Alefantis did not appear in court and ignored his summons as last warnings were issued. At least I think that's what it says https://www.dccourts.gov/cco/maincase.jsf</p>
<p>Maybe someone more legally literate could tell us exactly what's going on. The link there for the court records is the DC courts search system you can look up Bucks Fishing Cases as well.</p>
<p>ALSO:
We have contact info for approx 10 POI who may have direct connections or at least be in relation to Devoya Robinson and her co owner Steve/Steven Bolas/Boas</p>
<p>I find it odd that this guy appears to go by the alias by either dropping or adding an L or N. you'll notice it looking him up.</p>
<p>Get Digging.</p></p>

<p><p>you got downvoted but to the typical person, you're right.  Some people look at me like I have two heads when I say something about the DNC rigging the election against Bernie which there is clear evidence of.  If they didn't have an open mind there's no way they would be receptive 15000 word email detailing this entire thing.  And if it weren't to be a giant expiation with everything we've found thus far, you'd really sound nuts to most people.</p>
<p>*you need to investigate this pizza place because its the center of the worlds largest pedophilia child sex trafficking operation. Hilary Clinton is pedophile and potentially a high priest in some occult Satan secret society according to Guccifer, who is the only one who know has been in her servers.  John Podesta is also a pedophile and there's evidence he's at the center or closely involved in all sorts of shit. The Clintons have been having people murdered for years to get people off their trail when they've gotten too close to the truth.  The Clinton foundation is the center of selling Federal Government services to the highest bidder; Saudis, Israelis, etc." as well as for trafficing children.  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children is actually run by this same group of people and it is used as a gatekeeper between the facts and the government. For this these reasons we want you to investigate this pizza place</p>
<p>sincerely, 
Reddit*</p>
<p>If someone just had that information thrown at them out of the blue, they would likely have trouble digesting it.  So we would have to essentially turn this subreddit into an email telling the story as we know it as well as we can.  But that will be a very long read and, similarly hard to digest if you're absolutely not receptive to this kind of concept.</p>
<p>We really just need someone from this sub who is already up to speed with the entire story.  It took me days of reading this shit before I started to believe it's true.  If someone was going to risk their life investigating this thing they better understand entirely what they're getting into before they agree to do it. </p></p>

<p><p>With the international interest growing quickly I'm sure we could get a few pros in on this with some crowdfunding. With the caveat that they be heavily vetted by our autists FIRST.
My first impulse was to look at the Pinkerton's, as they are in DC, and it would certainly bring media attention given their shady [history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkerton_(detective_agency).
But if any detective agency can't be trusted it's the Pinkerton's for sure...</p></p>

<p><p>Well, when you represent yourself, you are going to get out lawyered.</p>
<p>That's just how it is. She even is so poor, it looks like she must have had a fee waiver of some type.</p>
<p>Alefantis not showing up is a strong indicator of guilt.</p>
<p>Still, I'll need to see the original petition to know what to make of it. I can navigate pleadings fairly well.</p></p>

<p><p>Just to play devil's advocate, he could have not showed up because he didn't think it was an important case (and that's what he'll say if anyone ever asks him about it).</p>

<p><p>A summons is a summons and is punishable by contempt if you do not comply.</p>
<p>In this case, though, his opponent is self represented. Which means, more filing fees to file the Order to Show Cause for Contempt, another court date 6 months out and then, a layman, has to figure out how to employ subpoenas effectively against Alefantis.</p>
<p>If she had a lawyer, him not showing up would have been a nightmare for him involving jail time. I have held people to task as an in pro per, and they piss themselves. Then, after you have had them fined and imprisoned for being shitheads, you pay the $2,000 for a video recorded deposition, where they piss themselves again.</p>
<p>It is a bureaucratic nightmare, though, and he exploited the fact that she didn't have an attorney.</p></p>

<p><p>Shows what a piece of shit he is too, to not be showing up at this court case and the person taking you to court is so poor that they're representing themselves and getting a fee waiver.  I can't imagine how terrible of a person he is, it must be nauseating to be around in within a close distance.</p></p>

<p><p>Thanks for bringing this to light!</p>
<p>Can you guys also look into law suits filed against the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children?</p>
<p>If you're not aware of that org and its ties to the clintons, and looks shady AF, please search on T_D for details. </p>
<p>Also check for lawsuits against Jeff Koons, who is on the chair of the ICMEC and has ties to Clinton, Abramovic, etc.</p></p>

<p><p>He won't show. He has never shown and especially now I'm sure he has no plans to.</p></p>

<p><p>Generally if the plaintiff fails to appear in a civil case the case is dismissed. If the defendant fails to appear the court can issue a default judgement in the plaintiff's favor. The exception would be if the defendant was not properly "served", but in many states service can be executed via certified mail. </p></p>

<p><p>Well that's why I'd like to know what happened in 2012 with the Devoya Robinson case. Because he didn't show but it appears that the case was dismissed anyways. And the court records appear to say that all summons were properly served but there is a redacted portion</p></p>

<p><p>I ran "bucks fishing" through an anagram generator. Because I wonder what a city slicker boy would want with fishing. I got nothing too crazy. EDIT: Buck's Fishing is a restaurant , and the name is tongue-in cheek. (Whether it's the <em>mouth</em> cheek, or <em>another</em> cheek, I'll leave up to you) </p>

<p><p>I'd be curious to know what James Alefantis' real name is, before he had it changed. </p></p>
