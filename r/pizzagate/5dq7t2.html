   <strong>
    Let's talk about Bryan Cranston.
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Over the past week, I've become enveloped in this story. I have so many unanswered questions about the things I could not justify. Hollywood is poignantly noted for their rampant pfla accusations. Bryan Cranston has his name on NCMEC. Why?
   </p>
   <p>
    An anonymous 'child star' on reddit posted a letter to /r/confessions. Some speculate this is Erik Per Sullivan of Malcolm in the Middle. He played Dewey.
    <a href="https://imgur.com/53KnUqV">
     The Confession.
    </a>
   </p>
   <p>
    The last line:
   </p>
   <p>
    "...or taking us on "special trips to their homes..."
   </p>
   <p>
    This pairs well with
    <a href="https://imgur.com/OoEDCRt">
     this.
    </a>
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm going to go back and look for more information. His
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1glx04/i_am_bryan_cranston_ama/">
     AMA
    </a>
    done recently also was spreading NCMEC's message.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm not sure if this is anything more than garbage or ballast.

    There is no proof at all that the OP is Dewey or any other child star. He also says that the dad never molested him, so even if he is actually Dewey he doesn't accuse Cranston of molesting him. We need to stop cavalierly questioning whether people are pedophiles without any actual evidence. It harms reputations and makes us look bad.

     I agree about the misinformation. I wanted this to be the place we either solidify or disperse his involvement. This isn't the first time I've seen his name float around here.
    </p>
    <p>
     How is investigating him unimportant?

     <p>
      Because we have no
      <em>
       evidence
      </em>
      against him. Even if the poster in r/confession is actually telling the truth, and the internet is right that he's Dewey (which is questionable because the poster complains about paying for his sibling's problem, and Wikipedia and IMDB claim that Erik per Sullivan is an only child), he says that his TV dad didn't molest him. I guess it's possible that someone could convince Cranston to talk about what he's seen, but this seems so far removed from the evidence that we do have and a waste of resources.
     </p>
     <p>
      Maybe I'm wrong though. It certainly would help if we got a big star to talk about the rampant pedophilia in Hollywood by important people. Research away, but remember that rumors of pedophilia are impossible to refute and incredibly damaging.

       Evidence is gathered by investigation. If we don't investigate, we'll never get evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole "let's not name suspects" rule is fucking bullshit. A thread the other day listing all staff of Comet Ping Pong was summarily censored, although every one in that company should be thoroughly investigated.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the State investigates someone, his reputation is ruined. Where's the outrage then? When the people investigate the State, they should somehow abstain from hurting the "reputation" of suspects?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want your reputation untouched don't associate yourself with the criminal government in the first place. People who associate themselves with criminals automatically forgo any such claim.

        And actually this is similar to people saying Wikileaks publishes "stolen data". FUCKING BULLSHIT, if you work for the government, or receive any government help/subsidy/support of any kind, you are working for US the people, all your data belongs to US, and we may investigate you in the way and at the time of our choosing.

          I think that thread should have been allowed. Those people work for Comet Ping Pong. Most of them likely know that something is going on, and either ignore it or actively participate in it. Comet Ping Pong is at the very center of this subreddit, and there is evidence that they are abusing kids. I have no problem naming names if they're connected to child abuse. I just think it's irresponsible to name names of people that are not connected to this (that we know of), and without much evidence at all.

     Not sure if you are one, but you've certainly been affected by their methods, and I have to say, I love it when I hear talk about how we live in a "post-fact society". Have you heard them? It's mostly liberal media, like NPR and MSNBC and John Oliver, bemoaning the fact that most people are simply fed up with being lied to by institutions - being asked to live in both a world of unparalleled information, and an intense push by the PTB to accept ways of thinking like "it is true for it is written", as they've always tried to do with religion and state-sponsored informants - and therefore are truly starting to think for themselves. It's alright; you're allowed to, you know. You can think your own thoughts, post them, and people like me will tell you that they appreciate your candor and passion. Realness is a very rare and valuable resource, even if it's not perfectly executed.

    Kranston was an outspoken supporter of the Wicked Bitch of the Left. But it could be any number of people, Tim Allen for instance.
It's suggested that in one of Jim Jefferies earlier monologues when he is talking about a possible rape with a fellow comedian, the person who matches that bio and timeframe was Tim Allen - and you don't hear much from those boys these days.

     I'm not sure the other hints add up though. I imagine the brother with a drug habit has to narrow the search down a lot.

     He says in the post that there hasn't been a reunion and none of the cast wants to do one. He also says that the dad didn't molest him. Also, there is no verification of who OP is. It seems like he is hinting that he is Dewey, but it's probably all fiction.

       It goes right along with people wearing illuminati shirts and quotes from Aleister Crowley like do what thou wilt.

         It was from Shepard fairey who took obey from the movie "they live". He was also the artist that did the Obama hope poster in tritone.

            Yes. And the full slogan was often "Obey Propaganda", which was a tongue in cheek criticism of people believing anything they see. Shepard's work, while aligned with Obama and the left, has always been insightful, cutting, and highly critical of corporate interests, media narratives, and abuse of all sorts.

    Intriguing and entirely possible, but in the comments someone asks why his "on-screen parents" didn't help and he replied "why would they? I hardly saw them anyways." To me, that rules out Cranston as a perpetrator (if this is indeed who you hypothesize it to be), but still doesn't undercut the bigger issue at hand...the fact that ANYBODY is doing this to these kids.

      Why would they do that, then go on to state "this show didn't have 3 brothers," then "this show didn't have 4 brothers."
     </p>
     <p>
      It's like they want you to find out, but the answer is wrong. Sounds like someone just didn't do their homework, or he got some siblings along the way that we don't know about. Also says he's famous enough to get noticed, I don't know how many people would recognize Dewey lol.
     </p>
     <p>
      Are there any other comedies from that era that had 2 or 5 brothers, a famous-then-more-famous father?
