        <strong>Why don't they just make pedophilia legal and be done with it?</strong>
        <p><p>That stuff seems to be rampant in elite circles. Lots of higher ups in politics, entertainment, industry, clergy, law enforcement, military, royalty, higher education, science etc. are apparently in it.</p>
<p>So, why don't they make it legal? These are the very same people behind the media and laws! They could start a pro-pedo blitz anytime ("research found out pedophilia is perfectly normal behavior among humans bla bla bla, apes do it too"). Politicians would be put under fake pressure by the press and complicit scientists to accept this fact and so on. And et voila, done. Pedo is legal and they won't have to hide anymore.</p>
<p>I always wonder: What stops them? Why don't they just do it?</p></p>

        <p><p>It's a power &amp; control thing and makes manipulation &amp; blackmail easier. Here's an example in regards to drugs:</p>
<p>http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/23/politics/john-ehrlichman-richard-nixon-drug-war-blacks-hippie/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities," Ehrlichman said. "We could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did."  --- former Nixon domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman </p>

        <p><p>What most people are missing here is that D.C. is its own entity. It is <strong>not</strong> beholden to normal United States laws. It's basically an extension of the Vatican. It has its own laws, its own cops, etc </p>
<p>D.C. was set up this way so the Vatican could traffic their kids with no consequences.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well the most obvious answer is that it is amoral.  If they some how shoehorned it through our public uproar, then what power would they have over each other?  I think our premise is that it is a surefire way to control people through fear that, if they fall in line, their disgusting pedophilia will be leaked to the public.</p></p>
