        <strong>Someone posted this on the Facebook pizzagate group page.</strong>
        <p><p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I saw an infomeme earlier on a post from the Daily Sheeple (I'll post the meme as a comment).</p>
<p>I need help finding an article from the Rome Observer which reported a 'Jewish paedophile ring making snuff videos' , dated October 1st 2000.</p>
<p>When I googled the article I was linked to a different article from the Guardian which documents a paedophile making snuff videos out of Russia and distributing them around the world. </p>
<p>After searching through the other google results, and enlisting the help of a friend, we have come to the conclusion that the Rome Observer has possibly changed its name and/or domain.</p>
<p>We then proceeded to search established Rome newspaper archives for news about a paedophile ring or snuff films that was posted on Oct 1st 2000.</p>
<p>My friend found another Rome newspaper documenting such a story.</p>
<p>http://archivio.corriere.it/Archivio/interface/slider_pagine.html#!/01-10-2000/01-10-2000/NobwRAdghgtgpmAXGAJlALlMAaMAzAJwHsYkwAGARgHpLzqAmc5nMdIsq2+plgX2zho8MgGs4ATwDuRAilbo4AD3RkwfALpA</p>
<p>You can see the words 'video' and what looks very similar to the Italian word for paedophile - 'pedofilo' ?
It's not possible to zoom in on the article without subscribing and you need an Italian phone number to do so.</p>
<p>Myself and my friend feel that finding this article could be important so any help would be greatly appreciated.
Edit: Guardian link -&gt; https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/oct/01/ameliagentleman.philipwillan?0p19G=c</p></p>
