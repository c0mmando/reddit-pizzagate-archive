<p>They probably aren't, and even if they are, Hillary probably didn't want her henchmen to have too many secrets.  Compartmentalize all aspects of the conspiracy, and that way one whistleblower can't give away the entire operation.</p></p>

        <p><p>we really need to figure out a motive.  Why would the Podestas involve themselves directly with such risk?  Why <strong>that</strong> child?</p>
<p>What if an arrangement was made with the McCann's ahead of time?  The McCann's sedate all 3 kids, the parents go out to eat and the child they sold/traded gets "abducted".</p></p>

        <p><p>Additional links between the Podesta's and Freud's and the McCanns:</p>
<p>Podesta Group - main lobbyist group for Azerbaijan</p>
<p>Matthew Freud - Son of Clement Freud and director of Freud Communications (PR firm for Azerbaijan)</p>
<p>Clement Freud - father of Matthew Freud and neighbor of the McCann's. Also accused of child sex crimes.</p>
<p>Sara Latham - interesting career history. Has worked for Podesta, Clintons, DNC, and Freud Communications. Only included her to  show further links between the above entities...</p>

        <p><p>Almost seems like the authorities knew right from the beginning exactly who took Madeleine and what happened to her. These sketches can not be just a coincidence, not with both of the Podesta perverts.</p>
<p>These near 100% match sketches could have been made to make the Podesta brothers aware that there is hard evidence against them. Almost like a blackmail/leverage thing.... </p>
<p>Just a thought. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, absolutely a possibility. Or these deranged perverts could actually have enjoyed the "thrill" of doing the abduction themselves, with the knowledge that they would be protected by other powerful pedophiles in high places in Portugal....  </p>
<p>Just reading about these evil vermin is giving my soul cancer.  </p>

        <p><p>They were two different sketches made of one man. Sorry, but it's a coincidence: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/madeleine-mccann-latest-are-police-any-closer-to-knowing-the-tru/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mary and Martin Smith, from Ireland, told police they saw a man carrying a child matching Madeleine’s description at around 10pm on Rua da Escola Primaria, 500 yards from the McCanns’ apartment.

        <p><p>If they are the same man, why do they look so different? I could understand subtle differences, but the facial shape and hair color are completely different.  Is it possible that something was lost in translation?  There just seem to be too many red flags (pics are spitting image, email scrub day after, house next door connection).</p></p>

        <p><p>I think the more likely explanation is that, like witness testimony, people regularly see things and perceive things differently and this ends up in differing accounts and differing descriptions. While I agree that the similarities are almost uncanny, the only posted identification of the images are stating that they are two images of the same man. Coincidences do occur. I'd need to see conflicting information to suggest a police cover-up. An early report that showed those images and claimed it was two men. Then...then shit gets real.</p></p>

        <p><p>since you ask this pizzagate stuff is being created to discredit the conspiracy community and give tptb a reason to install new and decisive controls over the internet - they're probably going to stage some form or murder or something crazy at one of the pizza restaurants, blame a pizzagater and they'll be lots of handwringing in the media -- probably the story is something like someone will abduct a pretty little blond girl thinking they're saving her from pedos but while fleeing he'll cause her death in a tragic way which will shock the nation and allow them to pass any old bullshit as long as it's called the 'make sure this doesn't happen again bill'  </p></p>

        <p><p>There was something very strange going on right after Madeleine was reported missing. A lot of very influential people got involved in this case immediately... It really does look like a cover up operation was put in place by an elite and international pedophilia network. Makes sense if it was powerful people like the Podesta brothers who was behind Madeleines disappearance. </p>
<p>This is from a documentary in 4 parts about the case, watch from 38:00:</p>

        <p><p>This picture that has been a big deal is the main reason I made this account. My major issue is that the Smith account of the incident on Wikipedia that:</p>
<p>"The man was mid-30s, 5 ft 7 in – 5 ft 9 in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He did not look like a tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child.[54][55][56]"</p>
<p>Mid 30s? Podesta would have been in his 50s. Doubt he had brown hair either, not sure why the picture doesn't portray that though.</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann</p>
<p>Now we look at the sources obviously, but it is a book. The only one we can check is [56]. That description of the suspect isn't in the (only) online article. Anyone actually have that book?</p></p>

        <p><p>Take of this what you will, but this one is almost impossible to confirm further without police resources.</p>
<p>Also be aware that this part of the investigation is the one that is getting shilled the most and I still can't decide if they are using this topic to discredit us, or they're trying to push the idea that McCann is still alive. Something I very highly doubt.</p>
<p>This specific topic spawned a 2-day rash of suspiciously repetitive posts so I hesitate to consider this to have evolved organically given that the posts that related to is on multiple venues originated in ways that seem very uncharacteristic compared to all the work that went on in the week prior.</p>
<p>I'm going to remain very skeptical until anyone can find or provide information on where Podesta was for relevant dates.</p>
<p>The only lead I managed to find is that according the FEC records the Podesta Group received a considerable amount of money from Tyco Electronics and their parent company. Those companies have facilities an offices all over the globe including less than a 3 hour drive from where McCann disappeared.</p>
<p>Podesta is also on the Trilateral commission that held the WTTC Summit in Portugal on May 10th through the 12th of that year. If Podesta was in Portugal for that event and went to Portugal early, he either only attended on the 10th. Otherwise he wouldn't have been seen in DC on May 11th.</p></p>

        <p><p>Around that time I believe in the emails, someone emails Podesta saying have a good trip. We don't know where he goes, but there were some other emails he received about programs in Portugal which is where the girl was taken. </p></p>
