<strong>I Urge You All To Look Into "Johnny Gosch" and "The Franklin Scandal"</strong>
<p><p>I do not believe this is related to the Podesta/Clinton Foundation/Pizza Shop investigation, but it does shed light on what these people are capable of.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In 1982 12 year old Johnny Gosch was abducted from suburban West Des Moines, IA, while delivering newspapers. Officially, he has never been seen or heard from since. Johnny's mother has never stopped looking for him and following all possible leads, and her resolve has lead to some striking discoveries.</p>
<p><em>Who Took Johnny</em> is on Netflix, though I'm sure it is available elsewhere. It includes extensive interviews with Johnny's mother and other aspects of the case. <em>Cyclone Fanatic</em>, a website that follows Iowa State athletics also interviewed Noreen Gosch in <a href="http://cyclonefanatic.com/podcasts/fawcast-behind-the-scenes-of-iowas-most-famous-crime/">this podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Johnny Gosch was scouted by people working for pedophiles including having pictures taken of him for inclusion in a catalog for "shoppers." Once a buyer was discovered, he was abducted to be sent to that buyer for personal use, or for the production of pornographic material for later sale.</p>
<p>The Franklin Scandal involves the ring of powerbrokers in Omaha, NE, who facilitated much of the capture and sale of these boys. Some of these boy prostitutes were allegedly flown to DC and taken on "midnight tours" of the White House.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Please, watch the film and listen to the podcast. Jerry Sandusky is the tip of the iceberg. These creeps are all over this country and sometimes they even have friends/employees who will facilitate their fetish. THEY MUST BE TAKEN DOWN.</p></p>

<p><p>Um, actually, they probably do have a connection. The Franklin Scandal first came to light due to a Washington Times article about the Bush(Sr.) administration: http://educate-yourself.org/tg/franklincoverupexcerptwashtimesphoto.shtml</p>
<p>Plus...um...Bush Sr. and...Joe Paterno: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Paterno#Political_interests</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Joe] Paterno was a political conservative and a personal friend of President George H. W. Bush, endorsing him as a candidate in a speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bushes and the Clintons are best buds. Senior definitely voted for Hillary, but I don't know about Dubya.</p></p>

<p><p>You should also read the new book on amazon titled 'confessions of a dc madam', which tells the story of a guy who got roped into the whole cia/secret service blackmail op that was connected to the Franklin Scandal.  Eye opening stuff that's never been released before, and the author, a guy named Vinson, took his life on the line to write this...</p></p>

<p><p>Honestly, when Fogle and Sandusky got caught, I knew others would. I said before that pedophiles are far and few in between. For the most part, they are connected because there aren't many of them. When you're talking about "higher ups" being pedos, they must be in cahoots to get what they want and keep it a secret. I never knew this is what would come of them being caught.</p></p>
