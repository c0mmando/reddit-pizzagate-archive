        <p><p>I had only seen the short one and now I found the full version, I feel the short version was cut in a way that was not representable, what do you think?</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree. Looks like a party for someone named Sarah Lord - birth of our lord makes sense now. "Special pizza" with secret recipe being ketchup. I think this was cut up and presented with a serious bias</p></p>

        <p><p>I certainly don't want to derail or discourage any part of this investigation, I just feel that this video has been given undo weight and taking things out of context will never build a strong case but just sets it up for easy picking.</p>
<p>Now having said that, this is the part I cannot explain from 5:16 to 6:40:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is another something that Sasha has done for me, this is for me personally. Six years ago before Facebook, I figured I was infertile, barren. So I asked Sasha to carry my baby, and you know what, she did it! At first I was alarmed, I was a little worried, I was like; ok, she is Russian, and she might sell it for vodka and soft toilet paper. But no, she didn't. She held on to that child all the way to the end. And the fucked up thing was really, it was after it was born, I had to put that shit down, euthanasia! You wanna know why? It came out really tiny, it did not have any hair and it had this rope thing coming out of it's stomach, this fucking cord! I was like, is this is this [how it happens]? with ??? babies? And oh oh, it kept saying "Di do da da aaa" I was like "all this noise!".</p>
</blockquote></p>

        <p><p>Finally someone gets the point of this post!</p>
<p>Oh, I missed that fact that she was named Sarah Lord, your right that explains those jokes.</p></p>

        <p><p>It is a birthday party for someone named Sarah Lord held at Comet Pizza. It is filmed in a dark setting with someone that goes by the stage name of Majestic Ape.
I'm not sure is the speaker is male or female, I thought male, the sense of humor about babies seems characteristic of certain gay culture I've encountered, but some people say it is a female with voice some voice altering effect on.</p></p>
