   <strong>
    DO NOT DOWNLOAD ANYTHING LINKED FROM THIS SITE
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Just don't. Seriously.
   </p>
   <p>
    Even visiting websites linked here could have disastrous results without proper precautions in place.
   </p>
   <p>
    Any link posted here could be a "honeypot," as others have stated. A honeypot, for those unaware, is essentially a trap- alluding to something enticing, then annihilating you when you access it. This becomes
    <em>
     especially
    </em>
    important when the "honey" happens to be gigabytes of child porn.
   </p>
   <p>
    Even loading these websites is enough to give away personally identifiable information about you. Ever wonder how those "MEET HOT SINGLES IN [your city]" ads work? They use that same information (IP address&gt;internet provider) to find your general location and reflect that in the ad itself.
   </p>
   <p>
    The guys putting this stuff out could be totally legitimate, and this new site could really be the piece we need to finish this puzzle, but DOWNLOADING OR POSTING LINKS TO CHILD PORN is simply idiotic, and could easily get this whole sub shut down.
   </p>
   <p>
    I just needed to put this out there. I didn't see anyone in the comments of those posts really saying how stupid downloading this stuff is, and it alarmed me.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm not even going to address how mentally scarring seeing shit like that would be.
   </p>
   <p>
    Please people, be safe about this stuff. Don't go down with the baddies when this comes to a head.
   </p>
   <p>
    TL;DR: See title of post. Also, scrutinize any links you see before clicking on them. Please.
   </p>
   <p>
    EDIT: Goddamn, /u/CaptMeowMix came through with an awesome self-authored post about proper netsec measures that should be taken. See here- https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e2hb9/a_definitive_guide_to_staying_safe/  (GOOD EXAMPLE HERE- Make sure this link will actually send you to the site it appears to. The easiest way to make sure you get where you want to go is by copying the link itself, and pasting it in the address bar in your browser. Alternatively, if the link is
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e2hb9/a_definitive_guide_to_staying_safe/">
     obscured
    </a>
    in some way, copy the link address and paste it in the address bar instead of clicking on it all willy-nilly like. See if it's a website you know, and search for it on DuckDuckGo if you don't.)
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Let me be clear here:
    </strong>
    I'm not trying to discourage
    <em>
     anyone
    </em>
    from investigating absolutely every lead that we possibly can, but there really needs to be a huge amount of care taken with regards to anything you do here. Also, really consider the mental toll that this shit can take on you before you dive in. There's no turning back from that stuff.

     I really dont want this whole effort to be overshadowed by headlines like "USERS SHARE CHILD PORN THROUGH REDDIT UNDER GUISE OF CONDEMNING PEDOPHILES" or something similar.

    <p>
     Interesting side note, my phone suggested the alien (ðŸ‘½) emoji when I typed Reddit... I'm gonna guess that's a loose reference to Snoo. Nice job, LG.

    Better yet, if you're legitimately trying to investigate, just

       I definitely understand your concern with everything going on right now, but really, are my points invalid here? I care about this whole cause, and don't want it to be overshadowed by reports of people sharing child porn on a forum supposedly fighting against it. Seems like a waste, and a chilling parallel to the entire situation at hand here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can believe what you want, and you should, but I truly just want this effort to be as effective and pure as possible, to avoid outside scrutiny.

        Very reasonable. The rule should be of you aren't affiliated lea you shouldn't download anything incriminating.

         I'm pretty well versed in the security precautions you would need to take, but even with that knowledge I wouldn't touch that stuff with a ten foot pole. It just screams "bad idea".
