        <p><p>the_donald is really compromised, I think. Seeing as there wasn't a single Wikileak post in hot/rising/new for the first like 5 pages, I made a few throwaways yesterday to test the waters to talk about Wikileaks to see if they were really censoring content. </p>
<p>Made a self-post questioning lack of Wikileaks content. Got around 1 upvote every 30 seconds with a couple of replies, got banned within 4 minutes.</p></p>

        <p><p>I said I understand your duties as moderator, however, I also said you have a duty as a human being first and you are ACTIVELY blocking very relevant information. If I would have made a main post, you would have instantly banned it. So I stuck to comments.  This does not alleviate the fact you are basically censoring CENSORSHIP Evidence. Do you not understand the irony?</p></p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/yxmW-QMOslI"><strong>Our Site Got SHUT DOWN for #Pizzagate Podesta Wikileaks Story [5:30]</strong></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our website was shut down after a third party DCMA violation over a screencap of an Instagram photo post  — not the photo itself, but a <em>screen capture</em> of the Instragram post of the photo — was sent directly to our website host to terminate our account, bypassing us completely. The site was suspended within 72 hours over the weekend and was offline today. We were forced to remove all traces of that image file from our server, not just from the article itself. It would appear this is an attempt to censor a story featuring allegations regarding the John Podesta Wikileaks scandal that has come to be known as #PizzaGate.</p>
