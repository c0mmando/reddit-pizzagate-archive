<strong>Everything is subliminal</strong>
<p><p>Ever since I was in my teens, I've always doubted things. Sometimes even my faith in God. Illuminati has always been seen as a joke, but for a few, they fight to bring about the truth, even along the way being labeled a nut job.</p>
<p>What started off as child molestation to me, as I've just gotten on this search in the past week,  has now turned into the biggest child slave ring orchestrated by our very own leaders, government and maybe even fbi. And when I thought it couldn't get worse, we dig deeper and find out that these kids are probably being used for ancient satanic rituals to be traded for years or eaten, and most to all elites globally take part.</p>
<p>Everything from trailers that aired in the 80's to TV shows, to messages across restaurant fronts.</p>
<p>I'm here today to confirm something for you. These are real spirits we are dealing with, and real demons at work. It goes higher up than we can imagine. This is spiritual warfare. To all non believers I pray for you and your protection whether you want it or not. I am on your side and send love.</p>
<p>To those who don't believe in God/spirits/demons and are also fighting the good fight, I once again pray for you, even if you don't believe or don't want my prayer. And I hope that this opens your eyes to the spirit world and the lovely love of God. </p>
<p>Fight good and fight hard.</p></p>

<p><p>Be careful of confirmation bias. We're all tired and beginning to suspect EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>Disney cartoons are basically a form of MK Ultra programming - i'd never let my children watch Disney, but this has been known for years (Club 33 etc - Walt was a well know 33rd degree Mason - i'm not blaming freemasons here though - this is different). Even their logo has the spiral and the 3 6's. The 6's are just to tease and mock Christian's though, since 666 means nothing to Satanists and the Occult.</p>
<p>Don't get me started on 'Let it Be'!!</p>
<p>I think the pizza thing may have started from Home Alone. But the slice of pizza is Fire or Water in wiccan (the triangle). Two pieces pointing in represents fertiity (butterfly)/the female.</p></p>

<p><p>You're right. I also have to look more into mk ultra. </p></p>

<p><p>There are fucking kids' lives on the line and you want to discredit what people are discovering with this crazy bullshit?  fuck off.  Don't add a religious spin to the REAL shit people are attempting to uncover here.  </p></p>

<p><p>Spirits are real. And kids getting molested is real. When did I discredit the kids? Child molesting hits close to home for me and others in my family. It's the number one priority. All love. We're in this together. No need to talk to me like that.</p></p>

<p><p>There is no proof of spirits. There is proof that Alefantis likes to take suggestive pictures with children.  Stick to fleshing out real details and real connections instead of bringing in your personal spiritual beliefs.  We can agree that there is good and there is evil and these people are evil.  </p></p>

<p><p>It's true, all of Hollywood's in on it. Watched Kevin Heffernan talk about raping babies for 5 minutes last night on some below the belt show. The Erik Andre show is just a way to get people on there to rape, the elite freaks watch the "televised" show and then they watch the "real" show. https://www.instagram.com/p/ig8Ddyk7OW/ it's normal to them at this point.</p></p>

<p><p>It just makes sense, look at their Youtube comments. Amber Rose has claimed 21 girls said the same thing but because Google is in on it so it's difficult to search for. They even call him Ian Connor http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2016/06/amber-rose-21-women-ian-connor-raped once you finally find something. If you google amber rose erik andre google tries to give you the impression that they dated or something. It's a twisted circus. </p></p>

<p><p>Eric brings guests on there for the sole purpose of raping them, that is how the elite works, it will all come out soon I'm pretty sure. People have been accusing him of rape forever.</p></p>

<p><p>Just watch the show lol it's obvious, I watched Kevin Heffernan do the same fucking thing on tv yesterday on his below the belt special. They joked about fucking kids for 5 minutes then had the audience decide which guest the two of them we're gonna rape. This cuts out all of the baby rape jokes but it was seriously going on for about 5 minutes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaKXawik44M</p></p>
