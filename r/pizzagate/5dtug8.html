    This letter from John Podesta, Andy Stern, and Anna Berger is addressed to these multibillionaires:
George Soros 
Jonathan Soros 
Peter Lewis 
Jonathan Lewis 
Herb and Marion Sandler 
Steve Bing 
John Sperling
Michael Vachon

    A Podesta email by Elizabeth Cooley, John Podesta's assistant was sent to Herb Sandler referencing time they spent together that week.  This was an email Wikileaks put out early on.
   </p>
   <p>

   </p>

    The famous handkerchief email came from Susan Sandler, Herb and Marion Sandler's daughter.

    Peter Lewis was also owner of a yacht named the Lone Ranger.  https://imgur.com/gallery/WFBdO
   </p>
   <p>
    This 1997 article talks about the secrecy involved with the renovations of the Yacht including armed guards while it was being renovated! The work crew worked around the clock to get it renovated!

    Several articles were written that link Maddie's disappearance to a yacht although it never mentions the Lone Ranger and speaks of maybe being linked to a yacht being owned by an Australian woman.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here is a copy of the Lone Ranger's advertisement when it was for sale at some point.

    The yacht was later sold to Eric Schmidt.

    Eric Schmidt, you might remember, is also included in the Wikileaks by wanting to help Podesta in Hillary Clinton's campaign.

    Lots of coincidental connections for years.  I wish someone could speak to someone who worked on the top secret "renovations" in 1997.
    <br/>
    Notice the ad says lots of room for "tenders and toys."

    Here is a different investigation where we ran into LONE RANGER... but the private jet version... not the boat version.

     Wow!  Why the different dates of the emails? Seems very strange for an email from 2003 to be in the mix?

    A lot of ties to the already know pedophilia acts by these people.  It the question is what would they plan to do with this yacht. Beside completely mobilizing them and putting them into international water they could fly whatever flag they want and possibly be protected by a country. A country that lives in these guys pockets possibly. One thing is for sure though the amount of things they could do on this boat is terrifying. Think Lolita Express but on a much much larger scale.

     Also, why was the renovation so top secret with armed guards? Did you read the article? From 1997.

      I did and it definitely brings to light some more people possibly involved. And there are plenty of possibilities as to what they had on the boat.
Edit: Were the guards intimidation for the workers to stay quiet about what they saw. Or to keep people off the boat. Or worse yet on the boat

      I  would speculate the guards were needed to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        prevent theft of materials (gold fixtures, expensive furniture, etc.)
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        prevent listening devices from being implanted
       </p>
      </li>
     </ul>

    I have also connected the child trafficking to an Airport where a jet owned by LONE RANGER LLC was located. They had noise complaints about late night flights not approved by the FAA... and the court records showed all the non-profits, politicians, and businesses involved before they changed the ownership to cover it up.
   </p>
   <p>
    It started when I was investigating the 711sx email domain in Podesta's inbox... the rabbit hole got real deep real quick... this was a few weeks ago, but I think I posted all the info on /r/conspiracy
   </p>
   <p>
    I can prolly dig it up again it you are interested.

    I seriously question why the renovations on the boat in 1997 was so secretive and why it needed armed guards.  I wonder if the quarters involved putting in sound proof room and/or hidden area to hide children.  It was then sold to Schmidt who used it and then it sold again a few years ago.  I think Wikileaks was about to completely connect these dots and then they have done something to Julian Assange.  Another person in the letter from Podesta is John Sperling and he was really into cloning and such.  Read this article! Creepy! Maybe they were not only into the sex part of children but also scientific experiments.???

    This reminds me of Sea Org. It certainly could've been used for anything from trafficking to pedo parties to God knows what else.

    I am trying to find Elizabeth Cooley who wrote the email to the Sandlers on 2007.  I can't find her anywhere on the internet! No pictures! It looks like she worked for the university of Washington and maybe married someone named Nelson.  Weird how I can't find her online.
