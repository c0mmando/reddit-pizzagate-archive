        <strong>The Podesta Brothers Go To Italy A Lot</strong>
        <p><p>There is one email that says they go once a year. They have been to Portugal as well. I'm not sure if this is important or not. They could be moving art internationally to launder money.</p>
<p>In this email they recommend </p>
<blockquote>
<p>but definitely try testieere in Venice
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55638</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is a Italian for "headboard". It is also in the name of a restaurant. </p>
<p>There are also several emails with artist Susan Kleinberg that involve things happening in Italy. </p>

        <p><p>That's where pizzas from, the Romans were notorious pedophiles and pagans, also the vatican is known for covering up rampant pedophilia among its ranks etc, but who knows</p></p>

        <p><p>https://pizzanapoletanismo.com/tag/the-mask-of-naples/<br>
Weird Mask history in Naples. 
"Pulcinella—thought to be essentially a mythical character that has evolved, mutated, and/or transposed over centuries—is of nebulous origins, possibly traced back to ancient Greece and Rome. No one knows with certainty."</p></p>

        <p><p>The most important factor though is were they in Portugal on 3 or 4th May 2007?</p></p>

        <p><p>It was in 2014 - https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/23724</p>
<p>However, they seem to attend every Venice Biennale, so they are in Europe at least once a year. I believe this art show takes place in May. Someone should look into this.</p></p>
