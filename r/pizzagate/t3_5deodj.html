        <p><p>... this was observed in a comment on another post. </p>
<p>The top of the "entrance shack" has pink shingles; at the apex, they are raised up to form the pink ridge directly over the entrance. You can see some edges of some of the pink shingles in this image; in other images, from a side direction, the pink roof is plainly apparent.</p>
<p>The pink &amp; green color combination was popular 30 years ago (early 1980's); they were "preppy" colors.</p></p>
