    Misleading title. Sounds like they genuinely want to help pedos deal with their issues, which is a good thing. Vice is one of the better news sources out there.

      Okay, fair enough. I'm not an avid Vice reader or anything, I've just enjoyed what I have read more so than a lot of other well-known publications.

       They used to actually have interesting stuff, like docs on North Korea, etc.  Now they've become more of an SJW propoganda machine.  Sad!

       At one point you would have been correct.  In Vices inception they stood for something but they've gone PC and drank the koolaid of the Feminists and are a complete shitshow now.

     a subcranial injection of Pb230grains is the only cure for pedos.  EDIT TO ADD: what sort of pedodefender downvotes the only cure for kidfuckers?  is that John or Tony?

      You realize that most pedos feel really bad for themself and never touched a child? Your position on this is the reason why they have to hide and cant seek out for help. Seriously get realistic about this, its not all white and black.

             If their was a hierarchy of heinous shit, touching kids should be at the top.  Though this is an opinion, I am sure any sane person would agree.

       They absolutely can seek out help, you are so full of shit.  Why couldn't they seek out help?  As long as they don't actually carry out their "urges" then they have exhibited a level of impulse control, and beyond that, they aren't going to be convicted of anything.  In

       they are still malfunctioning humans, though.

        Social stigma would be the answer. No need to get aggressive dude.

        I mean people have issues talking about beeing gay. Can you not imagine this would be a bit worse for pedos?

       <p>
        Edit:// I am not getting this out of my ass ether. I just sometimes like to read articles about psychology and disturbing topics. There is a lot of research done about exactly this. I assume the article above is also about exactly that.

          Yes you are taking crazy pills. Pedophilia is one of the most sickening things to me. Unfortunately people aren't usually born pedophiles, it's a result from being abused as a child yourself most of the time. So what you're saying is these people should be killed for having terrible thoughts that they likely can't help and never asked for in the first place after already suffering a traumatic childhood? I have no remorse for anyone that touches a child or actually acts on their pedophilic urges, but you realize a lot of these kids that are being abused are probably going to grow up and have these same thoughts as a result of being abused?

           If you read carefully, I have never said that non-offenders need to be killed, just that it would be a way to quell any genetic component.  Non offenders should seek help, regardless of the stigma, but I don't think (
           <em>
            opinion incoming
           </em>
           ) that this will do anything except maybe help with the impulse control component.  I also disagree that it is a learned behavior.  Sure there is nurture aspect to it, but there are plenty of people that were abused that did not go on to abuse people.  Additionally, if we assume most people are abused by their family (and this is a wild assumption, but probably true), then I would say it more likely just as much a matter of genetics as it is an issue with upbringing.

          appreciate that that stigma would deter people from seeking help. In fact, they aren't even remotely contradictory.

           I accept that it deters people from seeking help.  They should still seek help.  Why would someone need write an article that there is social stigma around pedo shit, when it it obvious to us all.  It is not like they are exposing some deep truth.
          </p>
          <p>
           The article, in
           <em>
            MY OPINION
           </em>
           , is normalizing the behavior through an attempt to collectively blame society's stigmatization of the the subject.  That is what I am upset about.  I am not saying that there is a contradiction.  I am saying that the article is trying to fulfill some agenda of normalization, and that is what I am upset about.

           Sorry I am not trying to be aggressive towards you or your opinion.  I am simply stating that I will stigmatize the behavior/urges/acts because for me it is black and white.  I feel bad that people are wired this way, it sucks, but I am not going to accept it as socially acceptable -- that to me is irresponsible.  I think people, myself included are aggressive because we are battling shilling, disinformation, and now, in my opinion, this article trying to normalize the behavior and lessen the stigma.  I have kid, and I don't want her to grow up in a world where we are trying to be so PC we are suddenly not stigmatizing this morally reprehensible behavior.
          </p>
          <p>
           I don't know if you or anyone you know has ever sought out help for anything, but it is not like social workers, or psychologists, or psychiatrists are in the business of turning people away.  I just don't buy that, and I won't let news articles on the subject sway my
           <em>
            opinion
           </em>
           about it.  If you need (not you personally, just people in general) help, get it.  This is an issue that should be stigmatized 100% of the time.
          </p>

            yeah i figured we met on the wrong foot :) I totally see your points, i for myself always try to have a view unbiased to things i dont understand. Pedophilia is a crazy topic, but as old as human history. Same is true for prostitutes and gays which also are not socially accepted in big parts of the world, but it is way easier to stay over it because it does not threaten us personally.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am really just a guy interested in these topics but i dont know anyone personally so i cant speak from experience. Pedophilia is a huge topic (sometimes more or less) in the dark/deepweb and therefore i (as mod of /r/deepweb and general Tor user) was confronted with it more than i ever wanted to and actually learned to have pity with some of them. (I know how crazy that might sound).
           </p>
           <p>
            I explain this, because i also sometimes feel i have the responsibility to bring different views into the mix.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, glad we could figure this out. i hate shouting on reddit ;)
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit:// To clearify, no pity at all for anyone who cant stand over these things. No touchy touchy

      Why boycotted? Honest non-shill question. There have been posters on reddit discussing their life as a (supposedly) non-offending pedophile.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pedophile = Attracted to children
     </p>
     <p>
      Pederast = Child Molester
     </p>
     <p>
      I am not trying to sway this into a philosophical debate, but as I understand it there is a huge problem for people struggling with these urges, as most of the tools and counseling available to help is only for offenders, so basically you cannot get help until you are a criminal. I can see why that would be shitty.
     </p>
     <p>
      That being said, maybe you are getting downvoted for advocating a death penalty for thought crimes.

       What is preventing them from going and talking to someone BEFORE they carry out and actual offense?  That is a load of horse shit.  My takeaway from the article is that people DO NOT seek out help because of social stigma.  Newsflash, IT IS SOCIALLY UNACCEPTABLE TO WANT TO ENGAGE SEXUALLY WITH ANYONE EXCEPT A CONSENTING ADULT.  There is a good reason for the social stigma.  If there is an element of nurturing this behavior through widespread acceptance it will simply become more prevalent.  I will say it again, my opinion is that there is an inherent issue with your biochemical makeup if you would do something like this.  Furthermore, I don't believe he was advocating the death of non-offenders, but maybe I am just naive.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: added a bunch of shit because it blows my fucking mind that you are going to argue that the "social stigma" is what is wrong here

         It stands to reason that people should seek out help then.  That way professionals can begin to understand it.  It should be stigmatized either way.

            Yeah because being reported to the police for your thoughts couldn't go wrong at all. Imagine if this was in a small town and one of the cops let slip and new started spreading around. Stuff like this grows in small towns and before you know it the person is a serial child rapist and there is a lync mob around his house.
           </p>
           <p>
            Could you maybe see why this person would be scared to seek help?

           This is not research you can even do without subjects.  I feel like we are going around in circles.

           There are so many social services available to anyone willing to seek them out.  My wife is a social worker and though I am not an expert on the subject, I have learned from listening to her that there are a wealth of social services in this country if you simply seek them out.

        No one is arguing the social stigma.  I am far on the other side on the social stigma debate.  I encourage it.  I don't even agree with the people that try to advocate against a social stigma for drug addicts.
       </p>
       <p>
        But when an article is talking about your sexual attraction as a possible orientation, and someone responds that the only cure is a subcranial injection of "Pb230grains" (lead bullet to the head),  I am fairly sure they are advocating death.

      I tend to agree... for some things I would say, "give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe they can change."  But if you cannot keep your hands of kids your brain does not work right and you should be removed from the gene pool.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, in this investigation, we appear to be on the brink of discovering (and actually in the UK it has already been covered a great deal surrounding Saville etc.) a massive network of disgusting, reprehensible, pedos.  How are there so many ped fucks in the world? Because people let them live and spread the taint to their offspring.  This is a case of nature and nurture, and wanting to hurt children is a genetic trait that should be quelled.

       Many mutations are not simply hereditary. You could kill every person with down syndrome and people will still be born with down syndrome. Many genetic predispositions are just part of the spectrum of possible mutations and expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to say I agree with the premise of the article, we do not have enough data, and we need to gain a better understanding of how these behavioral dispositions arise. If this is something that can arise implicitly from the continuum of possibilities that is the human genome than we need to be able to identify and characterize it so that we can better handle it in the future moving forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately solving the problem of pedophilia is not as easy as finding all the pedophiles and lining them up for the firing squad. An intelligent, nuanced approach is needed and we do not have the tools or data yet to formulate any definitive plan.

        I have a degree in biochemistry and a degree in biological engineering (also ChemE but not as relevant to the discussion, just adding for full effect). For Hood's sake, I'm not that dense.  I am just saying that, through mutation or otherwise these peoples brains are not functioning the way I, personally, want them to.  I am saying there is no behavioral cure for having a screw loose.  I don't buy a psychological approach to treating something that is inherently wrong with the biochemistry of the brain.

        If you can harm a child you lack the judgement, empathy, and impulse control to contribute positively to the human race.

        edit: "affect" to "effect" because it "feels" more right...

     It's like people who have strong urges to gamble, or use drugs, or become violent. They didn't choose it, but they are fucked up and it needs to be dealt with before they ruin people's lives.

     Castration or at least chemical castration should be an available option to use on sex offenders. Anything that works should be an option to have on hand if it helps prevent rape and child molestation.

         I agree, but as far as I know that's also how drug addicts, gambling addicts, alcoholics, people with violent tendencies, etc. are all like as well. They still feel the urges and they can only suppress them and do their best to avoid them. Doesn't AA teach people that they're always going to be an alcoholic, even if they haven't had a drink for years? That the risk of a disastrous relapse is always there?

    They are trying pretty hard to spin pizzagate connected people/themes positively. I don't know how connected they are to any of this though.

    This hints to something that i've been expecting they will do, which is normalise the idea in the public eye. Most say it will never happen that society could start viewing pedophilia as a normal or inherent sexual preference but the propaganda game is very efficient and subtle. There's almost nothing they can't get public support for eventually if its just introduced slowly and incrementally.

     Yeah there is no reason to write an article that basically says "pedophiles are stigmatized".  We already know that.  What the article is seeking to do is undermine that stigmatization by trying to blame society for these people's inability to function correctly and/or seek help.  It is their brain.  It is their problem.  It is their responsibility to get help.  I keep arguing with people who say their aren't resources to help these people before they commit an actual crime.  There are so many social services available in western democracies, this is a shit argument.  I am glad some people see that this sort of, "well it is societies fault" SJW PC bullshit has no place when it comes to pedophilia.  We need to protect children, and normalizing this shit is dangerous and disgusting.

    They have some excellent pieces, but unfortunately also a platform for propaganda. They have ties to the Clinton Foundation.
Similar to National Geographic.
