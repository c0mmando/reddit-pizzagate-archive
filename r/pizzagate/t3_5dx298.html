        <strong>I believe pizzagate was going to be Wikileaks's "phase 3"</strong>
        <p><p>The leaked Podesta emails were getting worse until mid October when Assange had his internet cut and was possibly arrested.
Short video 10/18:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T_h7pSVIFo</p>
<p>Following this on October 21st is a massive internet outage on the east coast.  This was possibly to cover the "Dead Man's Switch" as discussed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEhe6YPharg&amp;t=01s</p>
<p>Following this were weird indications that Wikileaks had been compromised such as a video released on their Twitter w Michael Moore outside the embassy claiming to have spoken with Assange. Problem is it was recorded back in June.
There is also reason to believe the interview released before the election was cgi but thats getting too far off topic...</p>
<p>Since mid October there have not been any damning emails as were expected.
Idk just an idea I had. Let me know what you think!</p></p>

        <p><p>May have been that. It is interesting that on Sunday, the week before the election, they announced they would start phase 3, but nothing different happened. They just quietly finished up the Podesta e-mails. Remember Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's director of communications, said a couple days before the election that if you see a "whopper" from Wikileaks, it was probably fake. It made it seem like they were expecting something that never came. </p>
<p>Maybe it was something about pizza gate, but we probably won't know. All signs are pointing to suggest that Wikileaks is compromised at this point. Though the media is purporting that Swedish lawyers questioned Assange, you can see  that no one actually talked to him directly. <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-14/julian-assange-questioned-by-prosecutors-at-ecuadors-embassy/8025082">This news article</a> says, "Swedish Chief Prosecutor Ingrid Isgren spent around four hours in the embassy, where she posed questions through an Ecuadorian prosecutor, before leaving without making comment."</p>
<p>If you just read the headline, you'd think they had actually spoken to Assange. There is just absolutely no reason they haven't given a decent proof of life since his internet went dark. Bad signs. </p></p>

        <p><p>Worse, wikileaks on twitter ask wistleblower to not believe the critics and send them files anyway without providing proof. This is way out of character for wikileaks to ask their sources to be reckless. They tend to be overly cautious rather than reckless.</p>
<p>Before that i was thinking it's probably blown out of proportion (like Julian may have been sick or something) but this is what convinced me. I've been following wikileaks for years, and while not being straight when communicating is common practice for them, this is a 180Â° cap change. They are compromised.</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree.  I went and watched the interview and definitely believe it was fake.  Tho I thought I would see more of this idea floating around but I haven't. I would love to know some problems with this theory. </p></p>

        <p><p>Even if it wasn't fake, there was no reference to time. That interview could have been recorded weeks in advance. The fact that it aired the weekend before the election is irrelevant. </p></p>

        <p><p>In either case, Pilger would have to be in on it. Or he is under duress. </p>
<p>Pilger is legit. He's always opposed the establishment. So if he knows that the interview is old but is not saying anything, it could be that he's being threatened or silenced somehow. </p></p>

        <p><p>Possible, but it still seems strange that there was nothing relatively remarkable about the e-mails that made them stand apart from the others. </p></p>

        <p><p>I am worried for Julian, and it is looking like Wikileaks has been compromised to me as well.</p>
<p>That being said, everything is going in our favor right now...Trump won against all odds and is winning before he even takes office.   I get the sense that the white hats are keeping their powder dry until inauguration day?</p>
<p>We have been lied to so often and so long...and now we got just a taste of truth through Wikileaks.  Knowing what we now know, we must have full disclosure and the swamp drained if we are ever to have any faith in our government going forward.  Would the TPTB be stupid enough to snatch Julian up right before the election and gamble on Clinton winning?  If they were, it tells me that what was coming in the next leaks was really damning.</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree with the idea that they're waiting until after Inauguration Day. That is my hope, at least.</p>
<p>If we don't hear anything at all by then, I'm afraid Julian's gone.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't think so. Wikileaks said that they didn't know what to make of this, but that it was curious. Had Wikileaks been compromised they could have shut this down. Something is definitely going on there. I don't think phase three has been released. I think this has kind of taken over. The focus does need to be here.</p></p>

        <p><p>2 posts back to back stating "I don't think so" and referencing the wikileaks AMA...hmmm.</p>
<p>The AMA was on November 10, 2016...long after Julian was perhaps taken elsewhere and suspicions began to arise that Wikileaks was compromised.</p></p>

        <p><p>Assange said in interview in early October that they would be releasing leaks for the next ten weeks. http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/4/13159914/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-julian-assange-google  That would bring us into December.  Why the change of plans?  Why aren't more people talking about this discrepancy? </p></p>

        <p><p>I don't think so. I remember in the reddit AMA they did somebody asked that (https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9uj1zc/?st=ivqpbagu&amp;sh=f3050e42) and they said that they didn't know what to think. Had it been the plan, they wouldn't have replied that way.</p></p>
