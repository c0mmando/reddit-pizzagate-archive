<p><p>Here's the thing about this: I've done a shitload of research into the occult and posted on cst, well, well before you guys even knew about any of this pizza stuff.  I know I'm right about this.  This is the seven sevens or the <em>thirteen</em>.  Call them what you will.  I think illuminati is sufficient.  Anyway, fuck whoever immediately downvoted this--it's clear you didn't undestand it whatsoever or your'e just an ass</p>
<hr/>
<p>on another note, I'm watching true detective and game of thrones...and noticed 2 things: 1) pedo spiral is shown many times on true detective..Mr. Cohl ("mystical") has it up on his wall when investigating the tuttle school's missing kids.  And on game of thrones they talk about the "seven gods" and have a seven pointed star of babylon (ie: sigil of babalon---shown here).  Taken together, it would seem hbo either knows whats' going on or this whole thing, pizzagate and all is simply predictive programming and/or a total artifice by the CIA--who, yes, guides HBO's programming</p></p>

<p><p>I'm in. Although it's scary to think our country was founded by free masons tho. All seeing eye on the dollar, Minerva the owl in the top corner of a dollar bill. Our country was founded by satanists. Kind of troubling to say the least. I would have never believed this shit 6 months ago. </p></p>

<p><p>I believe you, bodysnatchers. I think it's predictive programming. HBO had a huge stake in Hillary's campaign and they're always planting ideas in our heads way in advance with this kind of stuff. I actually forgot about the first season of true detective, second one was so bad it nearly purged my memory of the first. Interesting that there's symbology in there and definitely not a coincidence. Nothing ever is with these fucks.</p></p>

<p><p>George rr Martin wrote game of thrones and he is strongly anti-war pacifist. I mean one of his themes is on the meaninglessness of war and how the winner writes history so you cant trust history. It's very Philip Dick like. That doesn't seem like CIA material. Do you think they hijacked his work? I mean I know HBO made changes but the 7 pointed star, 7 kingdoms, The Seven religion and other things are in the novels. </p>
<p>Seriously if the Song of Ice and Fire series is not a good/beneficial work that contains accurate and important lessons then I may as well give up and join the dark side. </p>
<p>Really want your opinion on this bodysnatch. I value your opinion and I have to get to the bottom of this now (as crazy as that sounds). </p></p>

<p><p>I am a huge song of ice and fire fan but I don't think it's as anti-war and roses as much as people would like to believe. Those books have extreme feminism undertones and they're constantly beating you over the head with "you see this good guy? We're gonna chop his head off cause that's what happens to good guys. You see this bad guy? He's doing horrible shit and he's the new good guy. Being bad is sexy, right? He's gonna rape a 14 year old and political backstab and pillage and who gives a fuck cause bad is the new good and bad is sexy!"</p>
<p>In the same way House of Cards is <em>most likely</em> brainwash to make us think all these scumbag corrupt politicians are okay, I can't argue against the fact that George R.R. Martin is pushing some subliminal unhealthy messages and at times it really feels like halfway through ASOS, the CIA called him and was like "yeah we're trying to herd the sheep into a more feminism friendly type of thing so we're gonna need you to start reflecting that.. like a lot"</p></p>

<p><p>There are lots of points that could be argued on how to interpret ASOIAF. I think it definitely needs to happen so if you want I will respond to you better when I have. I have to take the cheap way out now because I'm typing on a phone and don't have the time right now to really make a case. I don't agree with you on the CIA aspect, but I think it needs to be talked about. You very well may convince me that you are right, and if you are right, I really want to know it lol. Basically this has a lot of significance for me so if ASOIAF isn't the work I think it is then it's really important for me that I learn that. </p></p>

<p><p>I don't mean to try and steer you away from ASOIAF, I mean I'd castrate myself tomorrow to be able to read TWOW by Christmas but just know that I operate on r/conspiracy fuel and I truly don't believe that anything in the United States is allowed to get popular <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/guru.pdf">unless it's screened by the CIA</a>. </p>
<p>ASOIAF is super feminist, anti-good guys, pro-corruption, underage sex and rape and incest.. laundry list of awful things it subliminally promotes and with what I know about the CIA and their history, it has to be intentional in my opinion. Nothing in the form of entertainment in America happens by accident. Ever. And the CIA's sole purpose is to basically sow propaganda and discord and make sure that the American people can believe in whatever they want, just so long as none of it is true.</p></p>

<p><p>To me, part that makes this personal to me, is that Martin (in my opinion) teaches empathy and understanding through his characters. Which ties in to the anti-war themes, how it's always some "lord" who convinces the peasants to go die for him because he wants someone else's castle, etc. Martin was also a Vietnam War critic and conscientious objector. Again, you have some good points that need to be discussed more and I just can't give it the attention it needs right now, but I don't see any "good" or "bad" people in the story, not black and white but all gray. People we saw as terrible at first we learn were doing what they thought was right, which doesn't make their actions less terrible but shows them as not being evil so much as misguided or confused or, like Cersei, fanatically obsessed with protecting her children from a prophecy that they'll die. </p>
<p>Ok so still lots more to be said. But the thing that surprises me the most from what you said is all of the bad things you see in it: "feminist, anti-good guys, pro-corruption, underage sex and rape and incest.. laundry list of awful things it subliminally promotes."  But you say you "don't mean to try and steer you away from ASOIAF, I mean I'd castrate myself tomorrow to be able to read TWOW by Christmas."  I mean I am fully open to the fact that I have been interpreting his message wrong and that it is as nefarious as you say. But if that's what you think what makes you still want to read it so bad? If you are right those are some pretty damning charges (subliminally promoting underage rape and incest) so are you ok with being excited for a book like that?</p></p>

<p><blockquote>
<p>so are you ok with being excited for a book like that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely! It's important to separate your entertainment from your understanding of propaganda. Those books are gripping. They're wonderfully written, best prose in the fantasy genre, and in my opinion they outclass everything that's ever come before it and will probably stand as the greatest fantasy novels of all time. But that doesn't mean I'm unable to see the propaganda contained therein. So long as you're able to <em>see</em> the propaganda and subliminal brainwash, you're able to avoid the effects of it, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I'm not necessarily telling you that you're interpreting the message wrong, that's the wonderful thing about books. But entertainment can also have a great message while also subliminally inflicting cultural brainwash. Hell every movie that's come out in the past 30 years has done that. Most of the time, just so long as you're pacified and entertained by the combat and the dragons, you won't think twice about the fact that the good guy just got offed and the new "bad-good" guy just raped a child, or that the brother just nonchalantly fucked his sister and then you catch yourself rooting for it. Then you slowly start to understand what kind of cultural brainwash is going on. </p>
<p>We're living in a world right now where people in the British government are trying to argue the fact that having sex with children has no effect on their psyche at the same time ol' George is writing books where everyone is having sex with children. I'm of the belief that nothing in entertainment is a coincidence. </p></p>

<p><p>Ok tomorrow I will try to respond to you better in a PM but one thing I will say is that we both agree that a lot of "entertainment" is subliminal brainwashing. I def agree. I also agree that, to a large extent, the CIA controls most of the entertainment in the USA. I had some previously favorite bands ruined after I learned their connections. Hell the CIA (or whatever its previous name was) was practically running Hollywood by the time Howard Hughes's Hell's Angels came out in 1930. So we agree at least that what you say does happen - although I think the MIC has a fairly firm grip on all media and entertainment, I don't think it is 100%. Even something as successful as Mockingbird can't be 100% in my opinion. Even if you think you own everyone in the business there is always a rebellious employee or mistakes made that slip through the cracks. So I saw ASOIAF (and all of Martin's work actually) as something like that. You have to remember to those books were published for years before they got any kind of mainstream success. But ok I'm done for now. I'll send you a hopefully better PM tomorrow then we'll see if you knock Martin off the pedestal I put him on. </p></p>
