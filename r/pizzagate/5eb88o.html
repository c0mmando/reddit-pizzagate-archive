   <strong>
    Examining the Occult/Religious Motivations
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    The more I look at the evidence, the more I am convinced that there are much deeper motivations at work here than simple greed. True, when left unrestrained, it does utterly horrible things to one's conscience, but greed alone can't fully explain why global elites of widely varying backgrounds have all settled on such unspeakable rituals.
   </p>
   <p>
    As we all know, these people are not merely callous and heartless; it's as if they've sold their very souls in exchange for their most abhorrent desires. In some ways, you could even say they've forfeited their humanity in order to divulge in these practices.
   </p>
   <p>
    Many witnesses in the past have attested to the satanic contexts of these rituals, so what we are dealing with appears to be a kind of blood cult which has taken root among the elite, and it seems to be a synthesis of ancient Near-Eastern heresies and modern-day mind control techniques.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unfortunately, this is where my knowledge on the subject of heresiography ends, though I do know that inversion is a significant aspect of satanism - particularly the ways in which it inverts Judeo-Christian norms - so that fact alone helps explain to me why it would take root among an elite whose origins are predominantly Judeo-Christian.
   </p>
   <p>
    Please share your thoughts, I think this warrants a broader discussion.

    I'm going to respond, even though I don't normally, because you seem genuinely curious.
   </p>
   <p>
    First, I don't believe anyone who is Christian, or at least anything but a gnostic xian, will understand this because they won't understand that even Christianity is just an extension of the blood cult, albeit for the masses. That's right, Christianity is a blood cult, (and so are the rest of them, in general), it's just that Christians were convinced instead of needing sacrifices Jesus was their ultimate one time sacrifice. Now I wont go too far into theology, but I'm just saying you need to step back and realize that the people who created Christianity were part of the elite Mithras cult and needed a tool to control the populace with. The point being that though the elite may pretend to have judeo-christian roots, they generally have a second hidden knowledge not shared with the useless eaters. Now, if you can get past that, even if you disagree, I will go further.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are multiple factors at play here. I think the most probable and likely explanation is that the ritual is just a cover for the blackmail power ring, but since we all know about that angle, I'm going to skip right to the juicy less probable stuff.
   </p>
   <p>
    The ritual sacrifices are (all allegedly):
   </p>
   <p>
    (1)To bind the group, more than just with blackmail, but people who undergo trauma together have special psychological bonds.
   </p>
   <p>
    (2)In some cases, the drinking of blood is done. According to some, the adrenaline and other things pumping through the blood of someone sacrificed is a more powerful drug than anything you could imagine. Cannibalism is also reported, but I don't understand the reason for it except as to further the trauma. Perhaps for the same reason as the drinking.
   </p>
   <p>
    (3)In the druidic case, sometimes the ritual is part of a divination ritual.
   </p>
   <p>
    (4)The participants/victims not sacrificed undergo mental trauma that often results in splitting personalities and other phenomena that result in a more pliable mental state for manipulation, mkultra/monarch style. Part of my theory for this is that you literally have to invest X amount of sacrifices into one who is designated as a matriarch/patriarch, so it takes, say 3-4 ritual sacrifices (sometimes with multiple sacrifices at each one) to create one matriarch/patriarch.
   </p>
   <p>
    (5)Who are the matriarchs/patriarchs? They are the powerful people, the politicians, the artists, the businessmen, the statesmen, the diplomats, the aristocrats, the royalty. So that they are more easily controlled. Usually abused at a young age (often they go through the process so young they don't even realize or remember they did!)
   </p>
   <p>
    (6)Now, the more ancient part. If correctly understood, the ancient rites of sacrifice primarily go back to long before even Egypt. Primarily Sumeria, or it's protocivilization near the old indus valley pre-deluvian, and also china. What do these three of the most ancient civilizations have in common? Tales of visitation from what I can only call in the sumerian as dogon or dagon, the fish headed man god who gave them the knowledge of civilization (agriculture, among other things). I have heard tales that many of the sacrifices are to dagon, or to an older darker force, ereshkigal. (though I have doubts that even the current illuminati understand these older more ancient things, and are often working on information distorted of the centuries, so often to greek or roman bastardizations such as Diana, or in the case of Amerois and the Ardennes, Arduinna) There are other gods, usually much more modern, like the Mayan, that have similarities. (The point here is satan (which is different from lucifer, another point xians often fail to understand) is mostly just a modern day bastardization of the old gods put in place by their cult leaders as a misdirection technique.) I also highly suspect gobleke tepe is very important archaeologically in understanding the early rites of the day, I hope they make more progress soon.
   </p>
   <p>
    (7)Now, the final point, is that to some in these groups, who believe in as above so below, that by performing these horrible acts, eventually the stench of the evil to the "gods", will force them to return, or force the vengeance of the good to manifest in some way, and so they think they are actually doing these things

    There is more, but that should be enough of a start for you.

    the left hand path is the EASY way to power.  the reason the powerful use rituals is that they work;  which is to say that once you start it's like a pitcher plant.....you CAN'T stop.  magic is a drug.

      I am not sure what is meant by "work".  Hopefully, that is not in a supernatural sense.
     </p>
     <p>
      I am thinking it is more likely an egregore.  I just recently learned that word.  Lol.

       egregores need to be "fed" and yes they call it "feed" and yes they can "take care" of things for those that "feed" them.
