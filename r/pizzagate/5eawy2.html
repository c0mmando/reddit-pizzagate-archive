    I have seen a few mentions of New York magazine reporting that Trump also attended a dinner party at Epsteinâ€™s honoring Bill Clinton.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I was looking for more information on that, I stumbled onto a quote by Trump
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     "I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,'' Trump booms from a speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life."
    </p>

     exactly! everytime you research deeper the truth of these cons begins to surface. Their propaganda machines have kept all this stuff censored and influenced people to think what THEY want people to think for their strategy. They are corrupt as fuck and try to cover their tracks and its so obvious when looking for real facts.

      Because Trump was involved in epstein pedo parties as well as his own as verified by many eye witnesses and by an accuser who sadly dropped her case in fear of her life. People try to choose sides and make it seem like its all clinton lies when the fact is that they are both lying to us! Both sides! Trump and Clinton are both tied to the same people in every branch of society and still are! Especially the big name corrupt players who people say are against Trump which is false and was never true. This is more evidence of it. So when people try to take sides in the connections with the clintons and trump and epstein pedo rings as well as trumps own pedo parties. Just remember you are doing nothing but splitting people up and not getting to the truth which is they are all guilty and running away from accountability by people claiming the other side is setting up the other side. Its bullshit, they are just trying to escape what they are guilty of by flooding the zone with people fighting eachother and blaming to the point where they get off scot free because people cant unite and bring them to justice. Trump is GUILTY and its time people know the GAME these con artists are pulling on us and their years of RAPE and PEDOPHILIA.

       Everyone knows clintons are guilty but too many people defend trump and he is the king of all this corruption and the man behind the curtains pulling the strings for decades and more responsible for this type of corruption and culture than anyone. Also he is now president so it is more concerning than anyone else. Stop defending Trump! It is a con game I promise you!

       The Trump stuff was classic projection by the Democrats. Accuse the other side of what we are doing. Nothing more than the other claims of racism, bigotry, homophobia, islamophobia etc

        i think you need to check your facts if you think clintons and trump arent on the same side, we're talking professional con artists who work together and use all the same tactics and are involved with all the same schemes and terrible behaviors. They arent enemies believe me.

    Leave Soros alone until more is proven. He's generally perceived as a positive figure, so attacking him won't do good to the cause.

      Soros is viewed positively by many people. I don't give a duck about him, just reminding the public here not to attack popular people without proof because that won't do you good.
     </p>
     <p>
      I'm cynical. I want coverage. Clinton, Trump and Soros will have to wait for their turn. First the story has to blow up.

        i dont think anybody views him positively pretty sure they are a trump troll doing the spin game now that donald is connected to him so "now hes the good guy", trolls, liars. I am online all the time and never seen Soros praised.
