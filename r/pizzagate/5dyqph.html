   <strong>
    Pizzagate hankerchief 'map'
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I have been following since last week. One thing I cannot seem to locate is the hankerchief known as a map meaning the thing to collect blood and semen. 
I have seen the email and the art that shows a towel or hankerchief but cannot find anywhere outside of here where it is known as a map.
Anyone know where a map has been referenced before?

    I'm thinking the map is a sort of trophy of their victims. In Kim Noble's paintings you can see a handkerchief under her abused body.

     Yea. I saw that but I cannot find a reference to it being called a map before pizzagate.
Is it something that is known in those circles and has been published before or is it pizzagate guys putting 2 and 2 together?
Has the artist said it was called a map?

      The artist has an extreme case Dissociative Identity Disorder and has no idea what happened to her as a child.

      I think that's just our best guess so far.

    These food posts are idiotic.   Half of them are probably disinfo.
   </p>
   <p>
    Google handkerchiefs plus map.  They're a thing.  The Podesta's are known for their "pizza parties."   The email was sent by a realtor.   Podesta left behind a handkerchief with a map on it.  Presumably it was of pizza places.
   </p>
   <p>
    This does NOT mean the pizza references are benign.   Comet Ping Pong demonstrates this.   But these are legitimate businesses in addition to being fronts.   The pizza references may indeed be code, but they can ALSO refer to actual pizza, since that is their cover.
   </p>
   <p>
    Stop it with these bizarre references to semen.
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit: I love that I'm being downvoted for arguing something that is actually plausible, as opposed to the loony toons  theory of OP.   This is why Pizza gate may be doomed to failure.   People become attached to bizarre, exotic theories and refuse to alter their opinions in the face of rational explanations.   We ignore the solid evidence in favor of wild conjecture.   People should be working on new leads with Luzzatto and Elfantis etc, not fantasizing about semen.
   </p>
   <p>
    Incidentally, Podesta emailed back that he didn't care about the handkerchief with the map on it.   So much for the "trophy" theory.

     So far it is only suggested that the map hankerchief is used as depicted in the Kim Noble painting so I am trying to see if there has been mentioned of something similar before.

      There are no "hankerchiefs" in the Kim Noble paintings.   Unless you're accustomed to hankerchiefs the size of pillows or blankets.

     Ok. Just saw your edit.
'Loony toons theory of op'
I do not think you understand English very well.
    </p>
    <p>
     I never stated I believe the theory. I am asking if there were any other references as I do not take things on face value.
It's not my theory. It has been around for longer than my awareness of pizzagate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Next time try not to be so aggressive maybe. You come across as mental as the all caps conspiracy guys.

    The best explanation I heard was that "map" meant semen bc DNA always leads back to the originator.

          A run down of the April 19, 2005 episode of the Opie &amp; Anthony radio show lists it as being towards the end of the second hour. I also know he talks about it on his album ‘Second Show Friday (Dirty!)’ which apparently came out in 2004 and in the Comedy Central special that was filmed during that time using that material as well that aired in probably 2005. I can't recall what track it's on but it's most likely track 11: Masturbation.

      No source, per se.  But like trying to decode any "foreign language", you run with the best definition of the moment.  If you look at the symbology in the artwork, as well as behavioral profiles of those who commit this type of heinous act, a handkerchief would make for a perfect trophy.  People like this like their trophies.

    I haven't seen evidence for any of the "code talk". Except for the handkerchief code.   And that doesn't actually connect to this stuff at all because the hanky code has nothing to do with pedophilia.
