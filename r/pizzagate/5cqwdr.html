    I did literally a 1 minute search and found a suspicious pizza place nearby (I'm no where near DC btw). I nearly fell off my chair when I found out the name of the complex it belonged to. Podesta emaiI terminology. Oh and some of the people who visited this complex (as indicated by the facebook location feature) were obsessed with none other than...pizza and children. This shit is widespread, son.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm not gonna reveal here where it is but I'm gonna try to convince a friend to go with me on Wednesday (apparently a significant day to the pedopizza cultists)
   </p>
   <p>
    Start planning how to monitor these pizza places. Pick one, look at the social media accounts, confirm affiliation with the pedopizza cult and go in there with A TRUSTED FRIEND YOU KNOW FROM REAL LIFE. Don't be suspicious AND PAY WITH CASH!

    Will do, I agree with this. I don't think we need to walk in and record ect. But at least look at local pizza places and their websites.

    While It's a good idea, it almost feels like you're concern trolling:  Hey don't focus on this case, go look in these haystacks!

     You felt wrong. If one pizza place can get busted for this shit with hard evidence (video or pictures or audio of children being abused) this global pedophilia ring starts to go down. You're the concern troll buddy.

      It's true, no stopping this ship once it starts to think. I remember the best pizza place in Gainesville was always sketchy. 45 minutes away from anything, lots of playground equipment, awesome pizza though. Check out their site, pedophile symbology right there http://www.satchelspizza.com/swf/menu.html. There's gotta be so many of these pizza places. Think I'll finally restore some sanity when the "news" finally talks about one of these places being busted and not fake protests anymore.

       Check out their facebook. They're advertising a "children's abuse" shelter. Sick fucks. Pedopizza cultists confirmed.

        Ugh, that's how these people operate it's sick. So many of these "children's" foundations and camps and daycares are all in on it. The people running the anti-human trafficking organizations are the ones actually doing the human trafficking. Think the best we can do is to know what to look for and keep spreading the word. The FBI, DOJ, and court system are already pretty corrupted by these people.

       There are no pedophilia symbols on that website. Those are regular triangles. You're making something out of nothing.

       you didn't post an archive so i assume there is not one. . . and the site is already "not found" an hour later .

       so whatever you thought was suspicious, we can't see.

        THAT is concerning, that a local shop not even mentioned by name or location knew to take their site down?? Wouldn't that indicate that OPs traffic is being watched?
       </p>
       <p>
        Edit: I mistook that comment to be from OP, when it was a reply with an actual link.

         my thought was either OP is getting tracked or that may just be monitoring this sub so hard any links and leads they can squash, they will.

        <p>
         I'm sure they have a dedicated cover up team.

      Your post contains no links to specifics.

      Yes, if this was telling people to focus on the current situation instead of wasting time looking up thousands of pizza joints, guilty as charged.

       This is related, absolutely. People have no hard evidence of children being abused even at Comet Ping Pong, yet they find it warrants investigation. And it does, and any other pizza place since it has come to light that pizza is a massive pedophilia signal.

        Those replies are suspicious af. They attack your lead and use of time as well as demand links. The one link that was posted on this thread to a local shop was taken offline within an hour. They are fishing for your leads to cover tracks.

         I don't know what to make of it. All I know is that hard evidence is the most important thing in convincing the public, because we already sound crazy with accusations of a Satanic pedophilia cult.
        </p>

         If we're not in the DC area, we have to investigate locally
