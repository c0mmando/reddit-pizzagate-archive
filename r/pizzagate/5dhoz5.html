    Do you think were victims of this mass pedo-ring? Made up stories of their history, kidnapped and bred, tortured and conditioned to be used as puppets for the media. Also, what about all the weird youtubers who have outlandish stories and seemingly fake home set up and overproduced videos with opinions that clearly are not normal? Like that Milo girl on youtube. She has thousands of followers but the numbers are off. People don't follow people they don't like, and the majority of her videos are down-voted by huge % more than they are upvoted... thoughts?

    I've had this thought.  I mean, by nature you would think journalists are inquisitive beings...Hell, humans in general are inquisitive.  I have always assumed these reporters feed false news to the masses simply out of greed.  Like "yeah, this is a lie I'm telling you but I got mouths to feed"...On the other side of the coin with this pizzagate stuff, I do also believe things go wayyyy deeper than we even know yet and I would not say that your thought process is entirely crazy.  There may be merit to it and something I will keep in the back of my mind as I observe all of this

     If these pedo-rings have been going on for a long time, some of these people who may have been abused could have been groomed to be reporters (Don Lemmon, etc). I understand people buy followers on youtube, but some of these youtubers who have a lot of weird opinions and a lot of followers are a lot of times talking in empty apartments, you can tell because they echo. Like LonelyGirl15 back in the day, she obviously was not one of these kids, but she was FAKE. A lot of thees "famous" youtubers or youtubers with a bunch of followers and weird opinions could also be phoney. Could these youtubers and some of the MSM reporters have been groomed through this ring as children of the state.

      Ok thats deep and interesting. I mean i know HowToBasic has a own apartment for this stuff, thats why its mostly empty. But for smaller, not so beloved youtubers, this is indeed strange.

      I would love to read/hear/watch more about this, do you have anything to link maybe trying to shade some light into this aspect?

       I am very wary of getting into this, but for the more prolific nimble navigators it is an area of thought that should be investigated. Think about it: This stretches into the far reaches of Hollywood, so anyone siding with these pedos, including people like Robert De Niro and Mark Cuban (who obviously have something to hide), should be investigated as well. With this Milo girl, she always seemed off to me. And her name as well. She came on the scene as a SJW almost around the same time Milo Yiannapolis did, almost as an opposition to his thought process. Now, on youtube, when you search Milo, the top two choices are these two. Her stories about growing up seem very contrived. As do a lot of these people on youtube with similar outlandish positions on things, so obviously funneled through an "opinion generator".  https://www.youtube.com/user/RoryDeganRepresent

        I think younger people are just being manufactured this way not through abuse and conditioning at the hands of pedophiles, but just because they are spoon-fed the "correct" opinion through a terrible schooling system, MSM saturation, third wave feminism being so very prevalent is enough to create little sjw-bots without any loose ends that could decide to talk.
