        <strong>Podesta Email Metadata Analysis - CURATED DUMP OF ALL NAMES AND EMAIL ADDRESSES</strong>
        <p><p>Hello r/pizzagate. My curiosity gotten the best of me, so I decided to download the raw Podesta emails and use data processing magic to see what might come of the effort. </p>
<p>In short, I wrote a small functional program that parses the header of every email, with the intent of extracting the To, From, and CC fields. IP and other fields are being considered for future release. Then, using the accumulated data, I filtere it, grouping the emails by contact name, sorted them, and merged any duplicate names and emails (at least as best as I could, given limited time and the horrifically dirty data).</p>
<p>A brief example showing John Podesta and some surrounding entries are below.</p>
<pre><code>John Ost, Political

John Podesta -
  john.podesta@gmail.com

John Podesta - CAP (john.podesta@gmail.com)
  john.podesta@gmail.com
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the results aren't perfect. As I mentioned, the data is quite dirty. In some address books, John Podesta was entered as "John P", "John Podesta - CAP (john.podesta@gmail.com)", etc.</p>
<p>Also of note are strange associations e.g. "eryn.sepp@gmail.com" listed as one of Podesta's emails. In this case, Sepp's email was listed because she sometimes received emails as "John Podesta" e.g. when ordering tickets for him, using her personal email with this name. These links can actually be useful HUMINT, as they reveal relationships and interactions between targets.</p>
<p>Also note that I left accounts with names that failed to successfully decode, and many are at the top of the list. I did this for the sake of completeness--maybe someone will notice of these addresses despite having an associated name, and it could turn into a legitimate lead.</p>
<p>But man, (possible) false positives aside, that's still a lot of active email addresses for one guy. I wonder what he's hiding? If his widespread email use any indication, I wouldn't be surprised to find the man is living multiple lives.</p>
<p>Anyway, this could be cleaned further, but my time is limited, and I believe this will be of use in its current state. So, without further ado, here it is:</p>
<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/fDqgixWQ">Standard Pastebin (slow)</a></p>
<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/raw/fDqgixWQ">Pasgebin raw file access (much faster)</a></p>
<p>Finally, time permitting, I may have some other things to share in the future.</p>
<h2>Edit 1:</h2>
<p>When searching, remember that this is going by contact name, and sometimes people opt for last then first name e.g.</p>
<pre><code>Podesta John
  eryn.sepp@gmail.com
  john.podesta@gmail.com

</code></pre>
<p>Maybe I'll improve the name sanitization logic at some point, but for now, bear that in mind as you dig.</p>
<h2>Edit 3:</h2>
<p>To clear up any confusion that may arise from the seemingly mismatched names/emails, here's a moderately technical explanation. The software extracts display names from the email header metadata (e.g. the "friendly" name entered when naming a contact using your mail client), as well as the respective email. Once it has scraped all pertinent metadata, it projects it into an easily digestible list. Unless there are undiscovered implementation bugs, if you see an email listed, the connection is legitimate. However, if you come across any bugs, please PM me, and I will get them sorted as soon as I can.</p>
<h4>What This Means And Why It Could Be Beneficial</h4>
<p>If you see a strange association, such as a politician's email listed under another known politician's name, this is expected in some cases. Take the seemingly erroneous Podesta/eryn.sepp@gmail.com association I mentioned earlier. The cause of this is actually quite simple.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Navigate to <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/25870">emailid/25870</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the WikiLeaks <strong>View source</strong> tab to the right of the <strong>View email</strong> tab, and then using your browser's page search capabilities, look for <em>eryn.sepp@gmail.com</em>. The matches should quickly demonstrate the cause of the observed behavior:</p>
<p>From: Nina Hachigian <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#110;&#104;&#97;&#99;&#104;&#105;&#103;&#105;&#97;&#110;&#64;&#97;&#109;&#101;&#114;&#105;&#99;&#97;&#110;&#112;&#114;&#111;&#103;&#114;&#101;&#115;&#115;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#110;&#104;&#97;&#99;&#104;&#105;&#103;&#105;&#97;&#110;&#64;&#97;&#109;&#101;&#114;&#105;&#99;&#97;&#110;&#112;&#114;&#111;&#103;&#114;&#101;&#115;&#115;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>

<p>In this case, it looked like Nina Hachigian CC'ed Sepp using an account with a display name of "John Podesta". Why somebody might do that, I am not sure. In some cases, I observed innocuous activity, but I still think this worth looking at. These people shift between addresses at a rapid rate and are known to use aliases (recall DWS's shifty activities), and they clearly do so with the intention of hiding. Who knows? Maybe we'll uncover an alias that will lead to something that might bring it all down. A stretch, but food for though. And, as I mentioned, this artifacts are indicative of close relationships between trusted individuals (think Ping Pong empowerment trust). That in itself may be of value. Remain vigilant, and know that we will win this. History is on our side in ways they cannot begin to understand.</p>
<h2>Edit 4: Listening Music</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned, I nominate the phenomenal Johnny Cash song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht7mxF9XZiA">God's Gonna Cut You Down</a> as background music for the hunt. I'm open to suggestions, so if you'd like to contribute any further additions, don't hesitate.</p>
<h2>Edit 5: Unknown Emails</h2>
<p>Emails with no associated display name as located at the bottom list under the [Unknown] header. These may be worth looking at to determine if the are alts for other well-known people. There are <strong>many</strong> emails that are currently <strong>many</strong> emails with unknown users. </p></p>
