    They are trying to mislead people, and once you call them out the mods delete your post. I literally commented saying this Marie Kate and Ashley commercial is not suspicious because they're talking about pizza for a fucking pizza commercial.

   <p>
    I just said dig deeper than this bullshit. Pathetic mods

     All the "I'm not a shill but this is stupid and you should stop" posts need to be deleted. Even if they aren't shills it's a form of distraction and discrediting.

      Yep.  True disinformation will come from those that say "don't look there"...Over 20k people with eyes on this and suddenly if someone wants to look into the occult angle they are going to sabotage the whole investigation...Like, listen motherfuckers, up until 2 months ago none of us would have believed this pedo ring is happening...And now you want me to stop pulling the thread there? Please.

     Bullshit posts sometimes get deleted if what they state and what their sources state are completely unrelated. This is to keep this sub clean. Mods are doing their jobs.

     Not all but some of the mods of this subreddit are shills. They try to discredit the investigation. I don't want to give names but I can if they force too much.

    Okay, this is the kind of post that is garbage for this sub.
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     <p>
      It does not bring any evidence or leads of any kind to our attention.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      It doesn't even discuss anything relevant to the investigation.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      It encourages insular tribal behavior over actual research.
     </p>
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    These kinds of posts will choke the sub and kill it. Please stop making them.

    I agree that too. is so different from what it was on /r/The_Donald lots of people attaching other conspiracy theories to this without any evidence, probably to discredit it to the eyes of the people or maybe just bad conspiracy theorist attracted to this one.

    On the contrary my friends, what you are doing is wrong and infantile. You're becoming the laughing stock due to theories that really overstretch and arguments that are hilariously bad assumptions.

    A lot of comments I've made here and in conspiracy are that I believe there is something going on and too many dots to not be connected to a bigger picture. I've been met with ridicule on a lot of it with some weak reasoning. One guy tried downplaying the creepy art by using the tired old "violent video games don't make me a killer" argument. Like, come on I'm not an idiot. Playing call of duty doesn't make you a killer, loving art that is creepy and about children definitely paints a certain picture

    Just hitting you with some perspective. I'm here. I'm not a shill. I'm not convinced, nor am I unconvinced. The very nature of posting on social media, regardless of your 'side', entreats opinion. Not facts, or measured, respectful discourse. Largely baseless opinion. You've got to feel one way or the other in order to begin to engage, bar none. For every person posting, there's a hundred that aren't saying a thing, for every single comment, thread, forum, or platform.
   </p>
   <p>
    What it takes for those people to voice their opinion is for them to simply develop one. A straw will break that camel's back and you'll find yourself spouting ideals and rhetoric.
   </p>
   <p>
    So when a thousand shills come crawling out of the woodwork, ask yourself -
   </p>
   <p>
    Am I so entrenched that I cannot see the forest through the trees? Are there truly people so paranoid and powerful that they're here, or hiring people to be here, to be scared? are there truly people who just refuse to see the light, refuse to see the truth? Is the world as complex as it is because of intention, or of ignorance?
   </p>
   <p>
    It's never that simple of an answer. That, I think, is the underlying theme here, and on other conspiracy subreddits. Bare that in mind, at all times.
