<strong>Some strategic thoughts</strong>
<p><ol>
<li>
<p>I'll start by praising the incredible work done by citizen investigators. Of course there is still no direct proof, like a video of ritual killings/rapes commited by VIPs. If these tapes exist (they are), you won't find them anywhere on the internet. But the circumstancial evidence and connections adding up to VERY DISTURBING LEVELS. It's still possible that we are deluding ourselves and it's a "few bad apples" and a lot of confirmation bias. But for the sake of my argument, let's say #pedopizzagate is true.    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who run these networks are the extremely POWERFUL. They control vast amounts of wealth, information and political power (politicians, military, law enforcement, judiciary, intelligence, organized crime, journalists...). Exposing them will make people heads explode and will lead to very nasty revolutions. There is no way they'll let that happen. If they have to detonate a nuke in a big city to save their cabal they'll do it.    </p>
</li>
<li>The "establishment" vehemently opposed the candidature of D.Trump, but we're still don't know if he's willing to attack frontally a criminal organization of this magnitude. More often than not, politicians and spooks use the information they get as leverage instead of exposing their enemies. That's the raison d etre of Wikileaks btw.    </li>
<li>If Trump is serious about draining the swamp, he needs to be fully in charge of the US administration to do it. So timing is very important, #pedopizzagate must start trending in the mainstream when he's in power. If shit start to unraveling too fast, they'll false flag everybody in a major war (civil and international).</li>

<p><p>I just hope Trump hasn't been blackmailed yet. He's a great man with a great career so he has nothing to hide at this point. I'm just paranoid that the White House meeting was already a set-up to make him compromise, or that he already has hits ready to murder his family at any time.</p>
<p>I think we need to show our support to Trump more in this sub. Tell him that we've got his back, so he shouldn't be afraid of those psychos.</p></p>

<p><p>You could be right, it's probable. I don't even know anymore. My reality has become a rollercoaster after all these events. </p></p>

<p><p>Guys... I hated Trump.. I didn't vote. After sifting through this darkness all day and night.. Fuck, I hope he makes it (as in isn't blackmailed, killed, etc..). We absolutely have pedos running rampant in high positions... And we might also have BLATANT SATANISM. https://archive.4plebs.org/x/thread/17506710/ 
If you pray... now is time to do so. </p></p>

<p><p>They may be "Satanists" but in the same way that Hitler was a Christian. </p></p>

<p><p>I'm pretty sure that those folks use deep web to share their content because they use social media as much as they can. We need someone like them to reach them. </p></p>
