        <strong>On Wednesday, let's target on Celebrity on Twitter to mass tweet about #PIZZAGATE (Ellen Page of "Hard Candy" (2005))</strong>
        <p><p>I don't know if many of you have seen the movie "Hard Candy" (2005), but it is related to Pedo-philia and CP. Considering that Ellen Page stars in this movie, and considering that Ellen Page has a large profile as an activist on a range of issues, I think that we should mass tweet her about #Pizzagate and see if we can get her to acknowledge what is happening. </p>
<p>While we must obviously keep digging, I think using a coordinated effort to increase exposure by engaging certain celebrities would be a good use of time. Hence, I suggest that everyday we choose one celebrity to target on twitter, NOT WITH INSULTS, but simply ask them to look into the scandal and speak out on it. I suggest we start tomorrow (Wednesday, November 23, 2016) , and I suggest tomorrow Ellen Page is our designated Celebrity.</p>
<p>Here is the trailer to Hard Candy:</p>
