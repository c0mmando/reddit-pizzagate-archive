<p>I'll never look at pizza the same way again. I just created a new pizzagate-specific account so it'll look like a newbie. Maybe you'll still recognize me.</p></p>

        <p><p>He says "the new credit card landing page". Could it be that they're using pizza sites as a front? For instance during the white House call boy scandal payments were processed through a "sub-merchant" account of the Chambers Funeral Home.

        <p><p>You conclude that it has video member ships from the "video_trial" site? And international, where did you get that from? I agree that this shit is boiling, but this email mostly just tells us that they have a credit card payment gateway plus some membership system (read newsletter shit, as any more popular place has).</p>
<p>Do you seriously think they have multiple discount offers for a child pornography site? Like buy 3 months get 1 free? A site which is purposelly targettet to the richest of the richest?</p></p>

        <p><p>Yea. Other e-mail had an example of the credit-card landing page, which made it seem like they were selling some information mailing list with subscription, but it had an already working pages for it, so this seemed to be some new "product".</p>
<p>Can't really tell at this point what pizza means with the stratfor-guys, but seems quite clear that its not literally pizza :P. Hopefully the DCleaks can be verified. Not gonna bother looking at them before then. They might make things more clearer. </p></p>
