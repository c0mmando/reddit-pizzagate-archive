    Personal experience to share regarding Satanic rituals and children
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    My friend began talking to me about this when I mentioned everything going on at Pizzagate. I will be changing basic details to protect their identity.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the 1960's this satanic ritual stuff was rampant. My friend lived in the DC-Maryland area during this time and their parents were pretty up there. His mother was past secretary for the White House, and the mother's husband was a high ranking military official.
   </p>
   <p>
    My friend has vivid memories from their childhood of witnessing satanic rituals. Some things included having him witness murder however it's unclear whether it was acted out or real. This is because they put people in boxes and then sawed in half, and as a child it's easy to interpret this could be an act.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was an entire neighborhood engaged in this. It was considered the best new thing among the rich community. Every adult in the community was either connected or at least knew something strange was going on.
   </p>
   <p>
    So consider this culture when looking at the people we are talking about. The community in question would now be elderly or at least in their late 60's-70's. It would be considered one of the best things to be a part of, a true marker of being high-class. It makes sense that some of these things are blatantly obvious-- they are proud of what they are doing and want to show off to other people in the community.
   </p>
   <p>
    My friend was also a victim of sexual abuse by these people. Family was involved. Part of these meetings was rape. There were other children involved, and the abuse continued from young childhood into pre-teen years. They openly engaged in violent satanic ritual and many children were victims in this neighborhood.
   </p>
   <p>
    They haven't spoken out about the abuse to officials because they know nothing will happen. They know it is all connected to other higher ups, and they are very scared. He wanted me to be careful with this stuff, even looking into it. But at the same time, he is encouraged by everyone researching. Thank you from him for bringing light to these evil people, you are being the voice for people that have been scared to talk for an extremely long time.
   </p>
   <p>
    If anyone has questions I can ask him.

    Thank you for the post, people need to understand this is real and happening pretty much everywhere and the entire media and government are in on it.
   </p>
   <p>
    People need to begin researching Satanic Abuse Rituals and they'll realize how horrible this stuff is, just impossible for us to even comprehend. This is going on everywhere right in front of our faces, it is absolutely massive.

    Thanks for sharing. This reminds me of Rosemary's Baby a bit, has anyone else seen that movie? It's a classic, but disturbing

     I will ask what names he can remember, but am trying to be sensitive about the topic cause it was really upsetting. He had to stop talking about it and go get some fresh air cause it was so upsetting.
    </p>
    <p>
     With everyone researching though it's given him hope that we might actually make an impact

    The False Memory Syndrome Foundation will be crucified after all this is said and done. Hell, that's nothing, most of the organizations established under our government will need to be reevaluated, as do many past laws (Adoption and Safe Families Act much?).

     I know that CPS has been shady for a very long time. The fact that they have a quota of children taken in to meet... I mean, incentives for taking children for their families? C'mon.

    I had never heard of this until I met a family while living in WI for 3 years. We were meeting for lunch and the wife ditched last minute. I sat in the husband's car as he explained how she had gone through childhood occult rituals and sexual abuse. She could experience panic attacks triggered by any random building, clothing, or smells bringing out memories.
   </p>
   <p>
    He said she had fractured personalities and selective amnesia, the first signs of the memory suppression didn't appear until a year into their marriage when she woke up in the middle of the night and tried to strangle him. He's a champ, and they stuck through it together.
   </p>
   <p>
    I didn't think much of it at the time, but I've thought about getting in contact again to get more details.

     My sisters also experienced weird Satanic abuse and sexual abuse when they were younger, but by my grandparents from Mexico. Idk, it stretches far and wide. Bizarre that this is somewhat common? Maybe that is just my perception.
    </p>
    <p>
     I am asking my friend today to see if they might give some kind of name or remember who was at the parties.
