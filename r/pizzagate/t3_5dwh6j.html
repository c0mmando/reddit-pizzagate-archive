        <strong>"pizza shop owner arrested" search results</strong>
        <p><p>I've seen a few mentions that pizza could be a code word for some of the bad things we see around the sub, and a lot of people are investigating various pizza places, so just out of curiosity I google searched for "pizza shop owner arrested" to see if there were any trends. I just looked at the first 10 pages of results, but there were a few stories related to sexual crimes - apologies if there are stories related to duplicate cases but I was searching on my phone. I deliberately kept the search string non-sexual so it didn't colour the results. The majority of the results were for drug and violence crimes.</p>

        <p><p>I mean, even in Disney you can find these pedo arrests, I think it might be reaching. How many pizza stores are there? Surely out of thousands a few might have this incident during their existence as a business.</p>
<p>I'd stay focused on Hillary, Podesta and D.C. and wherever they connect.</p></p>
