        <p><p>Been listening to this for the past 2 hours.   I just can't understand how this is possible. I believe it, but I can't comprehend.  And it's alarming that there's so little information about L King on the interwebs.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks for recommendation, I have heard S&amp;S is good in general for true crime. </p></p>

        <p><p>It's an awesome podcast all around, and probably one of the best true crime pods. He includes a lot of audio that some people might find disturbing, but if you love true crime stories, then you will definitely appreciate it. </p></p>
