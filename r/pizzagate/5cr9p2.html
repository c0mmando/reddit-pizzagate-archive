    Abramovic is a famous artist, this doesn't mean she couldn't be part of this all, but it definitely doesn't mean everybody she comes in contact with is also connected to pizza.

     But I think those leads are a good place to start. Pedophilia has been exposed in Hollywood, it is good to investigate all avenues.

     De Niro is also in a lotta art circles. His father was an artist in NYC. Doesn't feel like DeNiro is involved in any way with pedos.

      With the hate he showed towards Trump... trust me, that piece of shit is involved.

       IMO, he's just susceptible to the left' painting of Trump. Just like Sanders. But DeNiro is more of an alpha so he didn't hold back.

     By artist, you mean bullshit artist? If writing obscenities with a mix of blood, semen and fesces is art to you, then you have been brainwashed.

      Eh, it's like back in the 90's when some artist submerged a cross/Christ in a glass tank of piss and exhibited it. It didn't seem like art to me either.

       Yeah, you're further confirming it's garbage. To be validated as art, your work has to be validated by your pairs, not by politicans and bankers.

    This would explain his ALL OUT ASSAULT on Donald Trump--if he's implicated. Ahole.

     Holy shit.  That makes a lot of sense.  Freaking Robert De Niro could be involved.  Does surprise me, given how fucked up Hollywood is and they have a huge pedophilia problem.

      Urm no it doesn't make "a lot of sense". Are you serious? Where in his history does him being implicated in this shit make sense?

        Exactly.  That is what I thought by makes a lot of sense, given the huge pedophilia problem Hollywood.  Everything seems to be connected and Hollywood could be connected to it.  One of the reasons most of Hollywood was so outspoken for Hillary.

         Yeah I know. He's standing next to the women who is connected to the pedophile elite. Meaning he has a 2nd degree connection to the pedos. Not too much of a stretch to think he possibly does disgusting things with those people.

          Why does it
          <em>
           make sense
          </em>
          that Robert De Niro is implicated?
Why is this a clear logical path to anyone?
Maybe I'm not getting my message across here.

           It makes sense because De Niro has been vehemently Trump-bashing like he's fucking desperate for Hillary to win (i.e., possibly guilty as shit). Christ man, use your brain.

            So it makes sense that De Niro is connected to this because he's an ardent Trump-hater?
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't follow this train of thought at all. It isn't clear.
It doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

              He suddenly becomes unreasonably desperate all of the sudden about Trump not being elected
             </li>
             <li>
              Right after that, the pizza info and spirit cooking info are released
             </li>
             <li>
              It is appears podesta and Abramovic have ties to each other as well as ties to the pizza places.
             </li>
             <li>
              De Niro has ties to Podesta and Abramovic.

            </ol>
            <p>
             Put all of that together, and it is WORTHY OF LOOKING INTO FURTHER. Nobody is saying it proves anything yet, just that it is worthy of digging deeper. Good detectives follow leads like this. Bad ones dismiss them.

             u/hangthepedos among others are attempting to make this sub seem crazy as shit. Doing pretty great.

    Which charities and foundations does DeNiro donate to?

    It could be a deep rabbit-hole.
