    What is the connection between the Podesta's and the artist Kim Noble?
   </strong>
   <p>

   <p>
    Kim Noble is the artist of works depicting ritualistic abuse such as this:

    As far as I know, there's no tangible connection, it is just suggested that Noble's works are portraying the acts of this group. The fact that this piece in particular displays a handkerchief underneath the victim is what drew special attention to it, as it is theorized that is what the "pizza related map" on a handkerchief was.

     Really? I was under the impression that Kim Noble was a lead and a possible victim.

      I didn't say she wasn't a lead--I'd say she's absolutely a lead and a probable victim. I said that there is no "tangible connection," i.e. nothing that links her directly to the Podestas, which is specifically what OP asked about.

       Is there anything that links her to anything in Pizzagate other than depicting ritual abuse?

        Not that I'm aware of, which was the point that I was trying to get at initially, i.e. that she is very likely a victim of this sort of high profile, ritualistic pedophilia, but there is nothing that ties her specifically to people being discussed here.

    Also would like to see this answered. How is her art connected to this case other than by subject matter? I've seen innuendo that her stuff is literally on the walls at Comet, which seems dubious, but no evidence yet. Anyone got some?
