    Anyone else think this guys sudden about-face from conservative journalist to grovelling lackey of the Clintons seem really suspicious?
   </p>
   <p>
    Roger Stone said he thought it was all about "the money". Starting to think they had major dirt and turned this guy into a pliant stooge.
   </p>
   <p>
    In fact, I'm starting to think everyone connected to the Clintons is a compromised pedophile.

    Look into Christopher Ruddy, the guy who runs Newsmax. Used to be heavily right wing. Hell, he wrote the most famous book on the Vince Foster case in the 90s.
   </p>
   <p>
    However something seems to of changed his mind, as he gave 1 million to the Clinton Foundation.

   </p>
   <p>
    He is even pictured with Bill Clinton in a few photos.

    I think you're on to something.

     Really interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just checked wikileaks for Ruddy's name. Yep, he's in contact with Podesta, writing articles about how great the foundation is. PUKE.
