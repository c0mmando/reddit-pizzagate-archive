        <p><p>I thought of John Walsh a few hours ago, because I remember the story about his son, and what he has done with his life since his son was abducted.</p>
<p>So I thought to myself "What would have to say about this?". So I googled him. This article was the first thing I saw, and read. It is an "ancient" (from the year 2000) blog from an obscure website. Take it for what it is worth, as in "with a grain of salt", please! **EDIT: The author, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/John-Edward-Gill/e/B001KIJVNI">John Edward Gill, wrote a book about the subject in 1981.</a> </p>
<p>BUT...the author of the article brings up a good point. Humans are capable of great things. Out of tragedy, they can take their grief and focus it into something to help others. But, humans are also fallible, and when ever humans, <em>and government</em> get involved, goals are changed, resources are wasted, and the original vision takes a back seat to politics, ambition, greed, and worse. </p>
<p>I wanted to contact Mr. Walsh, but after reading this article, I fear he may be too invested in his project to be of any assistance. In his defense, he may not be the most hands on person there, and may not even realize the things the author of this article brings up. </p>
<p>I will contact the author of this article, however, as he seems to understand an aspect and side of this charity that I had not heard before. </p>
<p>TL/DR: NCMEC inflates stats--and publishes incorrect stats--of missing and exploited children, and receives millions of taxpayer dollars for dubious projects like fingerprinting. (which, according to the author, has never helped find a child) Not to mention fearmongering. I wanted to contact the famous founder personally, but now think it would be wiser to contact the author of this article--what else can he tell us about this phenomenon? </p></p>

        <p><p>"Well", I thought, "There is talk about the NCMEC on the front page...let's talk to the FOUNDER of the charity, the famous J<strong><em> W</em></strong>_!" </p>
<p>Then I started googling to see if he was someone who would be willing to talk, and I immediately found some disappointing things about the charity that put doubt in my head that the founder, the host of a famous TV show on FOX for many years, would have any culpable deniability. Nothing pizza related, more like a "justifying one's own existence" kind of thing. </p>
<p>I was impressed enough with this article I was reading (the linked article) that maybe someone with official experience would be interested in providing some insight and opinions. </p></p>
