        <p><p>Bring part of a hierarchy, a part of a system, changes your behaviors, alters your moral compass, and if your way of life relies on that system or hierarchy, you will often choose to defend it above all else. </p>
<p>This is just one example of how an individual in a position of power and authority can use that position to augment their ability to abuse victims, and to insulate themselves from scrutiny and consequences by exploiting the psychological mechanism mentioned above. </p></p>
