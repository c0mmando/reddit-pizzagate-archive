        <strong>I'm hearing from multiple people on one of our other fronts that the Madeline McCann lead was placed by shills and multiple people have turned up with dead ends and / or finding that it has no relation. What's the stance of this with you all here?</strong>
        <p><p>I'm about to start a massive compilation of information which I will fact check and either debunk or prove, and this is a good thing to get out of the way or pursue since it's been the focus point of many the past week or so. Has anyone else found that it leads to just dead ends or it has no relation? Really want to get the facts here so please comment your findings </p></p>

        <p><p>I'm of the opinion that the Madeline McCann lead should be investigated more. I saw one guy say its 100% false yet offered no proof. I agree we don't have 100% proof but what we do have warrants further investigation.</p></p>

        <p><p>Personally, I think it's a bit unlikely that two well known brothers, public figures nonetheless, would travel all the way to Portugal to kidnap one little girl.</p>
<p>What were their motives?  Why her?  Why there?  </p>
<p>It seems a bit of a stretch tbh.  </p></p>

        <p><p>One possibility is that the parents were also part of a ring.   Perhaps the child was "loaned" out for the evening to the Podesta brothers.   Something went wrong (eg she wouldn't stop screaming) and violence resulted.   The "abduction" was disposal of the body.   That makes more sense than the Podestas sneaking around a rich neighborhood and breaking into houses.   </p></p>

        <p><p>IMHO: Assume that they have a point. Concentrate more on the other stuff that has better evidence. If head will fall, that case will not be forgotten.</p>
<p>So certainly not to disencourage people who are now searching for better answers about Maddy.</p></p>

        <p><p>The deleted emails from Podesta the day after her disappearance was what sparked the search of the disappearance date. Also the fact that Podesta was not replying to his own emails but his assistant was. Raising questions whether he may have been "out of office." Not to mention the almost identical police sketch of two creepy pedophiles that look just like the two creepy pedophile Podesta brothers..</p></p>

        <p><p>Personally, I think that it is best not to bring McCann up without more evidence. What little absolutely concrete evidence is already there (most of what is here is conjecture to a non-believer, let's be honest) for the case overall could be made to be easily dismissed by someone going "Oh, and he and his brother kidnapped Madeline McCann" unless there is proof to point towards. </p></p>
