   <strong>
    Ian Watkins
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm a musician in the US and I follow several music related forums.  When the news broke several years ago about this guy, Ian Watkins (lead singer of the Lostprophets) that was arrested for kiddie porn and rape, the news spread pretty quickly.  At the time, I didn't really know of the band and didn't read into it.
   </p>
   <p>
    At June 2016, i noticed that youtube was recommending me several of their songs for some reason.  I started listening and actually liked a few of them (I am slightly ashamed to admit that).  As a result, I researched this guy a lot more to figure out his story.  He was a pretty fucked up individual.
   </p>
   <p>
    The reason I am writing this thread is this: Ian Watkins is still alive, albeit in prison.  But his band was pretty successful and he ran with many inner circles.  He is a known pedophile, and you have to wonder if he had any contacts/knowledge that would link him to the Hollywood scene, and/or link the Hollywood scene to politicians (whether they be UK or USA).  Is there any way that one could extract information from somebody like him?  Or perhaps even from his ex-band mates.
   </p>
   <p>
    I know this is totally random; but I mean, how many known/proven/convicted Hollywood pedophiles are there that are actually still alive and might be willing to spill some information?  Just thought Id throw this out there.

    Yes they were popular here in the u.s. for a while. I remember listening to them.  Biggest song was last train home or something like that. I wouldn't doubt that they have info on at least the music industry side of pizzagate. Someone in their area could try to visit them or anyone could probably write him. Let me see if I can locate his jail address
   </p>
   <p>
    If anyone is interested in writing him to a so any pertinent questions. Here is the process for finding him. Not sure Her Majesty will allow him to receive mail that helps to bring them down but,  worth a shot. Or could quite possibly lead to being put on a list somewhere

     Wow, good job.  So each person who writes him would have to do this?  I was going to suggest if several people wrote him, we might have a better shot at a reaction/response.  Odds are, this guy knew about some other people who were "in the business", so to speak.  He is doing hard time.  I think he got 30 years or so- won't be coming out for awhile, but perhaps (if he's not a total whackjob in the can at this point) this could be some small personal redemption for him (not for anybody else though).

    Peaches Geldof tweeted about him (after he was convicted), identifying the mothers who had helped him. This was against the court order, and I am not sure why she had the information, or, if it was more generally available somewhere online, why she was singled out and threatened with prosecution for publishing their names. https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/28/peaches-geldof-tweet-ian-watkins-lostprophets
   </p>
   <p>
    She ended up having to publicly apologize and died of a "likely" drug overdose about 6 months later, a determination it took the coroner several months to reach: http://people.com/celebrity/peaches-geldof-likely-died-of-a-heroin-overdose-police-say/

     Weird - I never saw that before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, their goal was to hide the mothers' identity for the purpose of protecting the victim childrens' identities (which makes sense in a way).  But that is a weird coincidence that she died 6 months later.  Lol, why does everybody keep DYING

      She also died the same way as her mother (with an overdose ten times bigger). She had been a scientologist for the years before her death then apparently a member of the OTO which was Crowleys masonic offshoot. So a whole other massive rabbit hole.

       Yes, I forgot to mention that. And her death occurred 7 days after she publicly discussed her membership in the OTO and showed off her OTO tattoo in a magazine article http://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/891914_10151379236958321_906007533_o.jpg

     Maybe somebody should check his followers and/or the people he followed and see if any line up with those reported cp accounts

    Were they that successful? I thought their fame was mostly reserved to the UK.

     Not wildly popular in US as far as I could tell.  Although they frequented LA, I believe they recorded a few of their albums there. And if i recall correctly, he boasted about a few of his underage victims that were US residents, poss in LA.

     Nah, direkt the height of the Emocore-whatever craze they were one of the bands with the most mainstream appeal, being super big in Germany among other places.
