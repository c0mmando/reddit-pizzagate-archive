        <p><p>It's true. Outsider perspective here, trying to make sense of this stuff. This sub sounds incredibly delusional outside of a few comments like yours. </p>
<p>I'm interested, but it sounds more like far right conspiracy than anything. People taking random screenshots and accepting them as fact, pretty much nothing but circumstantial evidence. </p>
<p>If you want to be taken seriously, and if your allegations are true you absolutely must find a way to be taken seriously, you can't take this to /r/the_donald levels of memes and circlejerks. You have to approach this like level-headed adults. If what you all believe is true, there's way too much at stake to divert people's trust the moment you make them aware of the situation. </p></p>

        <p><p>Eh idk man, I have no idea what happened but that was ground zero for all this shit initally. The best times of movement were when we had new big data compilations. When there is more visible possible connections throwing the Autists from 8/4 are probably not a bad crowd source effort. </p></p>
