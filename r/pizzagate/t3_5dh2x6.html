<strong>Prepare for the worst -- mothers, grandmothers, relatives ARE "donating" their children to the pedophiles</strong>
<p><p>Guys, right now there is a huge amount of attention being paid to the Luzatto connection, a nanny who offered to transport multiple children into a warm pool as entertainment for adults. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dfiek/master_thread_pizzagate_needs_to_delve_more/</p>
<p>Debunkers -- some of them sincere; some, CTR -- will respond to this with something like: "yeah but she's their granny, obviously she's not going to offer her own relatives to be sexually abused, so you're just crazy."</p>
<p>I want to make something clear. Whether or not Luzatto is involved in pedophilia, THAT kind of response (that relatives would never give their own children to be abused) is inadequate. </p>
<p>To dismiss without question mountains of evidence and refuse to address the details, all because you think "relatives would never do that" -- it is intellectually lazy and naive, and it is not a form of real skepticism. Rather it is a lack of insight into how horrible people can be. </p>
<p>We need to break this kind of conditioning and respect the fact that horrendous evil does happen. The reality is, relatives DO give over their children to sexual abusers. It has happened all throughout history, and still does. </p>
<p>Two examples (among thousands):</p>
<p>Father gave his daughter to grandmother, grandmother then gave the daughter to ritual abusers. The abusers impregnated the daughter, and made her sacrifice and cannibalize her own infant.<br/>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws2GDT0Xr78&amp;t=11m15s</p>
<p>Mother skyped with high-ranking police officer, raped her own baby for him so he could watch
http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/colorado-mom-molested-1-year-old-son-sicko-skype-article-1.2593981</p>
<p>So a message to all aspiring debunkers and concern trolls: when you see with your own eyes a granny offering to transport her children into a warm pool as entertainment, dismissing it with "oh but a relative wouldn't do that" DOES NOT COUNT AS DEBUNKING. </p>
<p>Aside from whether Luzatto is involved or not, that kind of blind dismissal of possibilities is not an answer, and all it shows is that the would-be debunker is naive about the world we live in. </p></p>

<p>PS.   JIMMY SAVILE THE FAMOUS BBC HOST MOLESTED HUNDREDS OF KIDS AND HAD UNFETTERED ACESS TO THE ROYAL FAMILY WHICH NO OTHER CELEBRITY HAD, HE WAS ALSO KNOWN FOR HIS "CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS" EVEN THOUGH HE LITERALLY KEPT CHILDREN IN A SEX DUNGEON </p></p>

<p><p>You know something that has stuck in my head more and more upon reading these threads is Princess Diana. I am American and didn't see quite as much as obviously you British have with the goings on in England, but she was very careful and calculated in how she brought up her sons. It makes you wonder, if she possibly knew about this stuff going on and with the pedophile rings that no doubt certain members of the Royal Family are a part of, and done everything in her power to basically shield her young boys in all of this. Who knows? Maybe she was about to blow the lid off of it when she died. Definite food for thought.</p></p>

<p><p>Well one way or another she was definitely killed off. Too many question marks and I think we probably have similar views on "coincidences" after all of this</p></p>

<p><p>JFK was killed because of a few aligning interests:</p>
<p>-Texan Oil Money</p>
<p>-The CIA</p>
<p>-The FBI</p>
<p>-The Mafia</p>
<p>But LBJ brought all of them together.</p>
<p>LBJ was known for being incredibly corrupt, the most corrupt until The Clintons came around. LBJ was under investigation for multiple levels of corruption within the Texas Government until the prosecutor committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest 5 (five) times with a bolt action rifle.</p>
<p>One of the reasons we stayed in Vietnam was the "Huey" helicopter was keeping Bell Helicopter - one of Johnson's biggest donors (he would frequently use a helicopter as a campaign prop) from going out of business. You'll see that the iconic helicopter's government money was the only thing keeping them alive, and you gotta use equipment you spend money on.</p>
<p>So LBJ is crooked as sin, but JFK brings him in "to swing Texas" for the Democrats, putting him as VP. The investigation of LBJ continues through the running process (I believe, not certain there).</p>
<p>The mafia is brought in via JFK's father, Joseph Kennedy. Joseph worked frequently with the mafia, and would act as a voice the mafia could talk through, to limit exposure of JFK and RFK. </p>
<p>They would do the work without questioning it, but during JFK's election, Joseph has a stroke!</p>
<p>Now the mafia (who helped fund JFK's run) don't have a voice with the President and Attorney General they financed the election for. </p>
<p>This gets worse, RFK, Bobby Kennedy goes after the mafia...HARD.</p>
<p>They've paid for these guys to get into office and now he turns on you?</p>
<p>Next we have the Texas Oil Money - Kennedy ran on keeping a tax loophole open for the oil industry, the "Oil Depletion Benefits" and when he got into office, he started working viciously to stop it. We're talking tens of millions of dollars in the early 60's, 300+ million today. This is large money at stake.</p>
<p>Interesting fact: the Dallas Book Depository, the scene of "where Oswald shot Kennedy hitting 2/3 shots as a terrible marksman (he dropped a loaded gun at a range in the Marines and was kicked out by the range manager) within 5 seconds" that building is owned by a big donor of the Bushes, and I can't remember his name, but he's in Oil - big time.</p>
<p>The CIA was pissed that JFK didn't provide support via fighter jets for the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba. Instead, the Cubans MOWED the shit out of the CIA-backed coup, attempting to overthrow the Castro regime. This put the CIA on the map (they don't like that) and made them the fools of the world. This is how the whole "Ted Cruz's dad killed kennedy" came up, his dad worked with the CIA in Cuba for the Bay of Pigs, that's why Cruz is Canadian, his dad fled the country when the Warren Commission (the investigation into the JFK murder).</p>
<p>The theory is that if the communist Lee Harvey Oswald (with ties to the USSR and Cuba) killed JFK, we'd go to war with Cuba, and the CIA would get the war they wanted, now with public backing.</p>
<p>Next we have the FBI, which J Edgar Hoover was running like his personal task force, with no accountability or oversight. He was furious that Bobby Kennedy (The Attorney General) was forcing the Director of the FBI (Hoover) to report <em>through</em> the AG (which is his job to do) to report to the president. </p>
<p>Hoover wanted the direct ear of the President to sway his opinions, not be edited by the AG - this is something he had his entire tenure for years as Director - no President required the proper communication lines, so Hoover was losing direct access to the President and that's a big loss of power.</p>
<p>The general theory is that the Mafia provided the actual trigger men (there are supposedly 3 that shot at Kennedy (JFK, Bobby's suspicious murder is later) and that the CIA provided the cover story:</p>
<p>A patsy to take the fall which was Lee Harvey Oswald, who was seen drinking a can of soda 10 minutes before the shooting happened on the first floor of the Dallas Book Depository (did he then jog up 6 flights of stairs to kill the president? Wouldn't he be perched up there for hours before hand scouting?)</p>
<p>Then the FBI worked to hide the entire investigation, eliminating the story from the media, getting Dallas (known to be corrupt) Police and Texas State Troopers to keep shut if possible (there is many testimonials from honest Troopers who say they saw something weird that day).</p>
<p>So LBJ becomes President and:</p>
<p>-The Texans get their enormous Oil Tax Savings</p>
<p>-The CIA makes Cuba look unstable and hostile to the US in public view</p>
<p>-The FBI Director keeps his voice directly in the ear of the President</p>
<p>-The Mafia settles a score of a "you didn't do what I paid you to do, so you die".</p>
<p>Then Lee Harvey Oswald is killed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv_viK8qOfw">National Television, hell here's the footage.</a> by Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner with a 20 year history of involvement with organized crime.</p>
<p>The Dallas Police allowed a mafia connected, man with a criminal background, carrying a loaded pistol in the same room as the man who just "killed the president" which should be the #2 most secured room in the country (besides the one the current president is in). </p>
<p>Either incredible, world shattering incompetence, or upfront collusion.</p>
<p>With Oswald dying, the final loose thread was tied off.</p>

<p><p>Think of all the nasty, cruel people out there who violently abuse, and even have murdered, their own children.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Those same kind of parents would highly likely give their kids to people like this, <em>especially</em> considering these people could easily afford to pay these parents significant amounts of money for doing so.</p></p>

<p><p>For those that think the close kin of a child would never give their kids up for abuse whether because of bribe or blackmail, you're so wrong. Just one example of how this sometimes happen is this - community leaders, influential families, pastors, etc. can be put in positions of power either knowing they are already pedophiles or roping them into becoming one. Then that leverage can be used to make them do all kinds of things including pimping out or even selling their kids. These often end up being "private adoption" incidents.</p></p>

<p><p>I thought children are most often abused by family members. Numbers totally off the top of my head, but something like 80% of child abuse comes at the hands of family/close family friends.</p></p>

<p><p>another way to look at it - they could be non biological kids. adopted or stolen from orphanages from supporter networks. BOOM. always close, anything can be dismissed as "kids stay dumbest things"</p></p>

<p><p>Allegedly, the Clinton Foundation only works in countries which don't produce Birth Certificates. </p>

<p><p>yep i heard that but havent gotten 100% verification on that. seems bizarre that countries today dont do them. </p>
<p>i think the claim can probably be easily disproved though. for example i went on CF website and randomly search some countries they "help" - Tanzania, Kenya, Malawi. Then did quick google search of those countries + birth certificates and it seems most of them do issue them.</p>
<p>the better link is that they operate in countries where there are natural disasters, civil wars and lack of oversight in the process imo</p></p>

<p><p>Statistically speaking, the majority of child abuse is perpetuated by family members or close friends of the family.  The same occurs for rapes.  It's why it's so horrifying when a woman comes forward against an athlete, but it gets dismissed because they had a previous relationship.  So maybe we should be looking at the children close to these people, the Luzzatos included.  </p></p>
