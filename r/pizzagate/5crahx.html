    Just a question, but Podesta also talked a lot about "aliens". Should we be looking into that?
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I remember when the emails were first coming out and we all saw the pizza/food ones and just thought they were random. I also remember people laughing about the alien emails as well. I don't have any new evidence about this, but considering how the "random" food emails aren't so random with new information, would it be worth our time to take a look at the "alien" emails again?
   </p>
   <p>
    EDIT: For the less intelligently inclined out there, what I'm obviously saying is that it's possible he wasn't literally talking about alien life from outer space, but perhaps this was another way of being able to talk "in code", much like we are seeing with the pizza language.
   </p>
   <p>
    EDIT 2: Here's an email were they discuss "disclosure" and "Zero Point Energy": https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1766
   </p>
   <p>
    EDIT 3: And another email: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1802
   </p>
   <p>
    Unless there is actually a secret space war going on, I'm going to say these are codes.

    Sounds like it is common to stage fake stuff like alien abductions, "plays" etc as part of the mind control as well as to cover up the actual abuse knowing talk of aliens would lead people to not believe the accusations

     I agree with the common trick analysis.  Also that
    </p>
    <p>
     Though my thought is that if you are looking for an international child trafficking ring involving the military industrial complex try googling "MILAB"

     That's interesting...I also know on of the common themes of many abduction stories is probing/testing of a sexual nature.

    Can someone link the alien emails? When I searched alien on Wikileaks I couldn't find anything that looked coded or suspicious, just actual UFO discussions

     I believe a code word used for UFO's was "fast walker" or something like that.

    Isn't Podesta a known UFO-believer or something?. Seems like he will get alot of e-mails relating to it from random people all over the world, if its more widely known.

     Yeah, on the face of it that's what he is, but on the face of it he was also just a guy who loved food before we realized what was going on.

     I'm not sure that's significant. If it's a code it could be enough to get the email and know who to call and what to talk about.

    no issue with talking about them, but they aren't relevant in this subreddit (at least not yet). you should keep it in r/conspiracy unless someone finds a link between these two things.
   </p>
   <p>
    also, the people sending these emails aren't people like podesta or people in powers of position. it's other people emailing podesta (i know some of them you can google their email address and find the website where they publicly talk about the same things they email to podesta).

    Makes as much sense as the rest as what he's done. Could be?
   </p>
   <p>
    Maybe it stands for Illegal Alien or some such? it would make sense that they would be the most victimized since they aren't supposed to be in the US any way.

       You fucking rube...how can you be so oblivious to what I'm saying? I'm saying he possibly wasn't
       <strong>
        literally
       </strong>
       talking about alien life from outer space...perhaps it was used as another way to talk in code, in the same way as the pizza language.  Jesus man....some people just defy explanation...

    This would be better in r/conspiracy since everyone in pizzagate is trying to stay on the pedo investigation.

     I'm saying the "alien" talk could be linked to the "pizza" talk.

      Many of the ETI emails were from a former Apollo Mission astronaut who has been one of the most vocal proponents of ufo disclosure from within NASA. Peripheral research goes a long way.
