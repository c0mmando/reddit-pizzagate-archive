        <strong>Stop posting information already up!</strong>
        <p><p>Guys stop posting things that are already up.  Browse or search before you post. No need to clog up this sub as it gets harder to find useful info. Less is better as it will be easier to follow.  </p></p>

        <p><p>I agree, I have been following this sub for about a week now and in the past few days have noticed a large amount of disinformation/reposts/unrelated threads..</p></p>
