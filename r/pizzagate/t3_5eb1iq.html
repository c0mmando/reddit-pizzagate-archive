        <p><p>It can be read dozens of different ways. My opinion at the moment - though it may change - is that the Clinton camp helped with the article in some way. Tina doesn't say whether the article was good or bad in her initial email, which makes it seem like the Clinton camp knew about it in advance.</p></p>
