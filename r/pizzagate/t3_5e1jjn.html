<strong>My twitter account got locked after ONE tweet with #PizzaGate</strong>
<p><p>I created a twitter account so that I could reply to David Seaman (@d_seaman) and suggest that he'd do a podcast with Joe Rogan again (he's been on the JRE before), seeing as it could be huge for #PizzaGate visibility. I replied to this tweet:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/d_seaman/status/800497628710637569</p>
<p>I can't even find my reply tweet anymore. Those of you with twitter, tweet about this to Joe Rogan and David Seaman!</p></p>

<p><p>He has already created a video where he goes to Bohemia Grove. Creepy Satanist ritual shit there, but obviously he needs to revisit this topic.</p></p>

<p><p>If you just made an account that's like the reason. I've tried making a second account and find they lock within minutes, not sure the trigger but they sure do seem to want a phone number (which I won't give. I think I got lucky on my main and it was grandfathered in before all this auto lock bullshit.</p></p>

<p><p>True story: My girlfriend from a while back made me go to a Joe Rogan Show.  She had to drag me out of it during the middle of his set, because I was screaming at him calling him a pedophile.</p>
<p>The people watching his show were in some kind of trance, and didn't get what he was talking about.  But, he was clearly talking about the sexualization of minors, and explain how it's OK.</p>
<p>I didn't like the guy to begin with, and I'm not easy to BS about.  But, he starts talking about 16 year olds and historic context and BS like that, and then younger, then some disgusting stuff on that.</p>
<p>I LOST IT!!!  Started screaming at him.</p>
<p>He didn't stop his show to confront me.</p></p>
