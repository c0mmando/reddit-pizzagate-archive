    Is anyone here up for real investigating?
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Is anyone here actually interested in doing some actual investigating?? Regardless of what narrative you believe I have leads on the ground in DC. People who have worked closely with Alefantis and the other pizza shop owners. People who could have seen things that we would want to know about, or at the very least people who would know the inner workings of the restaurants and the day to day activity. These people have no allegiance to anyone and they might not even be aware that they have pertinent information. If anyone wants to get serious and turn this into a real investigation instead of whatever the fuck these LARPing idiots want to keep distracting us with then please hit me up and we can work on talking Ina more secure medium and do our best to see if each others are shills. I'm tired of seeing all the subreddits that just a couple weeks ago were working so well get so clogged up and distracted.

    I think if anything exists as pizzagate, it has to be found to relate to David Brock... he is the link between Capitol Hill and pizza.
   </p>
   <p>
    From some simple Google searches, it is clear that Brock has a very controlled media presence: There are only a few (old) online photos of him where he is not pictured alone.
   </p>
   <p>
    I started trying to cross-reference relationships between him and Jeffrey Epstein's little black book... and encountered something I'd never before: Google interrupted my activity with a dialog that my search activity is unusual and I'd have to perform a captcha to continue. Maybe this is common for people who do this sort of thing. I am no hacker, just a person doing some Google searches.
   </p>
   <p>
    What strikes me as weird, having gone through some of Epstein's contacts, is the dearth of connections between the two... they are SO unlinked it is suspicious. They run in the same circles and have supported the same politicians, so shouldn't they come up in some common event or article or something? (I have found some mentions of them in search results, but the articles, including cached versions, don't show them.)

     I'd just like to say that I occasionally get the captcha thing at work when researching. I can spend hours researching a new topic that I need to work on so lots of searches and clicking links gathering as much info as I can to help me make the right decisions. I think the volume and number of searches can appear suspicious, as in you are not person doing this but some software.

     Just trying to put your mind at ease regarding that one.

     He is definitely in the middle of it all between the media collusion/coverup CTR and a relationship with  Alefantis.

    Im not cut out for the investigating. Im good at spotting shills and see when we are being distracted but thats about it. Anyone who digs into the real stuff has my respect and eternal gratitude.
   </p>
   <p>
    The twitter shit is a distraction. Stay on point with the politicians and their satanic pedo cult.

      It highlights two things.

     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>
        The issue of child exploitation is a real tangible issue that is everywhere, but we do very little about it as a society.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Twitter will censor #pizzagate but will not censor CP?!
