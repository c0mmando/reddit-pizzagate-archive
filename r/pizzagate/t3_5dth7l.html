        <p><p>After thinking about the phrase "get a pizza for an hour," I think he's talking about going to a location where they have kids that you can pay for by the hour. Just like a massage with a happy ending kind of thing. If only we could locate these locations by their symbols. There's many massage parlors that are owned by foreigners. You think they might have something available in the back room for creatures like Podesta? </p>

<p>Edit to add: Comment from https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fx7g9/how_do_you_find_out_if_a_massage_parlor_in_your/
"First post. Cant blame anyone for not knowing, but i feel ive got to let you all know that the overwhelming majority of these "massage parlors" are owned and operated by human trafficking groups - organized and unaffiliated alike. It is beyond cruel what these girls have to endure and i would beg you to do some serious 'soul' searching before you make light of or consider patronizing this crap. Polaris project and dc stop modern slavery are both very active human trafficking awareness groups in the delmarva/dc area and can drop some knowledge on ya - if you so desire. Also, consider calling the national HT tip line @18883737888 to report anything skecthy. Man up, don't be that guy.
Ps - i sure hope im not alone in my disappointment with this thread right now."</p>

        <p><p>I honestly hadn't thought about Comet Pizza as one of those places. Considering how they mention the kill room and all the construction going on, I figured it was the main place where they met to do their rituals and sacrifices. It's probably both. </p></p>

        <p><p>Please. Some one listen to me. In the pictures  there are brackets above the tables. I think the tables go on top of the brackes and a beam is slid down the middle to make a second floor. This has to mean something to someone.</p></p>

        <p><p>Think of it like a recruitment office. </p>
<p>They entice kids in to see who's vulnerable. </p>
<p>They invite adults in to see who is corrupt (or corruptible).</p>
<p>Same goes for all the other satanist stuff. It isn't so much that they believe in the occult, as it is a useful masquerade, as well as an opportunity for the insiders to assess potential members, and to put the kids in quasi-fun situations to confuse them and keep morale up, when they are also being abused by the same people.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't think it has to be the actual location of the crimes for them to be connected to it.  They could just be laundering money through there (ie: expensive catering gigs).  But who knows, it very well could be.  Do we know if the tunnels do in fact reach that part of town?</p></p>

        <p><p>I had looked into this site http://easthamptonbabysitters.com/
Which is now not working for me. But you can still visit the site it is linked from..
http://hamptonsmassageassociates.com/
Babysitter/massage therapist. The east Hampton babysitter site use to display a photo of bill Clinton bottom left.. weird that things are starting to disappear.. I believe I did take a screenshot of the Bill Clinton photo. </p>
<p>Edit: looks like babysitter site had too much traffic? Met it's traffic quota for the month? Still weird as hell maybe it will be back up next month..</p></p>

        <p><p>Every connecting website to this pizzagate case is total shit. I'm a designer so I may be too judgmental but I couldn't make such a horribly designed site if I tried. Does anyone else find it odd? Every lead has a shitty website don't some of these folks have cash to invest in a site that doesn't appear to be made from 1995?</p>
<p>I know someone found a protected login page on Comet Ping Pong. Maybe all these sites have a hidden backdoor which is why they have not been updated, as it would be exposed to the updated/designer.??</p></p>

        <p><p>I also found it odd. And it is significant. </p>
<p>In that it conveys they don't really care about being a real, quality place of business. </p>
<p>The websites as well as the physical locations look like they were just thrown together for surface appearances -- what you'd expect under the hypothesis that they are fronts. </p></p>

        <p><p>These are the same people who were in charge of the atrocity that was the Obama Care Health Care Exchange website, soo tech savvy obviously isn't their strong suit. On the other hand, You would think though that if they have some Silicon Valley web genius in this ring that they would at least make a decent looking site too. So ya know.</p></p>

        <p><p>I go there ALL THE TIME (first one)... I'm big into pizzagate but theyre great guys in randomass Ontario.</p>
<p>EDIT- seriously this is bothering me now because someone I personally know is being implicated and their small business is being associated with pedophilia on the internet. Now I could be completely wrong and overlooked a lot, but I highly doubt that. Can anyone explain to me how they got brought up because I'm not the most tech-savvy guy.</p></p>

        <p><p>I went down the Mike Berman rabbit trail. According to his bio at duberstein group...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Berman served multiple terms on the Boards of Directors of two non-profit organizations: The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, where he chaired the Outreach Committee; and <em>The Children’s Inn at the National Institutes of Health</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The NIH is the seat of the medical establishment and you will find connections between NIH and MK ULTRA. </p></p>

        <p><p>yea, it seems the prevailing trend is that these people are placed in these institutions so they can better manage the selection process for suitable targets and to tie up loose ends with phony investigations should anyone wise up to the scheme. </p>
<p>We need to cross analyze ever single person that's high up in these organizations with the people currently implicated in this.  I suspect we'll find a whole lot of them. </p></p>

        <p><p>Just to devils advocate, it could be, "you want to have a meeting for an hour?"</p>
<p>When you are real busy you got to set up a schedule pretty tightly. Y'all may be right, but if you start making everything seem guilty it takes away from the actual guilt.</p></p>

        <p><p>Could be, but they use the word 'pizza' too much for that to be the case. If it were, we'd see them talking Chinese food, sandwiches, burgers, and other meal terms if they really meant they were discussing business over an actual meal.</p></p>

        <p><p>After you've had enough conversations like:</p>

<p>A: Hey, wanna get pizza?</p>
<p>B: I'm busy.  How long would it take?</p>
<p>A: About an hour.</p>

        <p><p>There was another email where Tony asked John if he wanted to get pizza for an hour or have him bring one over, and then John responded that no he is too busy w/other shit (paraphrasing obviously) and there is no need for pizza. Basically made it sound like pizza would take forever.</p>
<p>It really did sound odd.</p></p>

        <p><p>That would be the real question to ask here. I can easily see "wired" being a typo for weird, and it could be weird if you were the only adult stuck sitting next to a bunch of kids. The suspicious part would be if there's no reasonable explanation for why he's with kids.</p></p>

        <p><p>Wired can mean a few different things. Wired can mean your nervous, excited, or other things like if you drank too much coffee. Too energetic.</p>
<p>Can also be used for drugs, too. Stimulants.</p>
<p>I use "wired" most often for coffee, but the email says he is "wired" because he is sitting next to kids. So he is nervous, excited, ect. because he is sitting next to kids? Wired is more positive. So he is feeling more excited because he is sitting next to kids.</p>
<p>"Hyper" or in French surexcité</p>
<p>That's the best I can explain it.</p></p>

        <p><p>Devil's advocate: It could be a typo. Instead of "wired" he might've meant "tired," which honestly makes more sense given the context. Sitting near a bunch of noisy or high strung children on a plane would be tiring. </p></p>

        <p><p>Just read these emails. This seems like a total stretch.. The guy asked if he wanted to go get pizza with the kids I'm assuming their families for an hour and he could be wired from being next to a bunch of kids on a plane. This is total conspiracy theory aluminum hat thinking</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't have one, sorry. Guilty of repeating something I read on 4chan that sounded about right. Worth looking into at least? Even if birth certificates aren't necessarily the defining variable, targeting 3rd world countries would be easiest for them becuase there is less documentation and ties to institutions to prove the kids even existed to begin with. Smaller the paper trail, smaller the risk. Makes sense if you're a satanic child trafficker anyways.</p></p>

        <p><p>They were the ones who broke pizza gate in the first place, and this sounded plausible. Didn't mean to make it sound so factual, just giving an answer that was likely. I agree that a source is necessary but I don't think there is a reputable source that straight up says it. It would have to be uncovered.</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree with this in general, but the point about the Clinton Foundation only operating in countries that do not issue birth certificates (or where it is difficult to track birth records) was said by FBI Anon in those famous threads of his. I don't remember which part specifically it was in (it's in 3 parts in total), but you can find them here: https://churchmousec.wordpress.com/2016/11/02/fbi-anon-speaks-part-1/</p>
<p>Edit: Found it. It's in part 2: https://churchmousec.wordpress.com/2016/11/03/fbi-anon-speaks-part-2/</p>
<p>Here's the direct quote from the thread:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What about the plausibility of Clinton Foundation (CF) and child trafficking?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The CF always operates in countries where birth records are difficult to maintain. Let that sink in for a moment.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote></p>
