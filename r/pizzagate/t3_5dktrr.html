        <strong>Idea to Expose This to the Public</strong>
        <p><p>Not a fake account, just a throwaway one; my real account is quite active on this and associated other subreddits. I've been wanting to contribute, but have no hacking ability and am therefore left with exposing as many people to this info as possible. Now, hear me out. Im sure ill get laughed the fuck out for this, and I know it sounds nuts, but after thinking about it i feel like it might actually have some affect. I live in a large city in the US (to be unnamed for obvious reasons) and was thinking about maybe tagging the sides of large buildings downtown with "#PIZZAGATE". (Tagging as in spray paint/graffiti for those who dont know) Downtown can be seen from a major highway that runs through it, and if done right could expose thousands and thousands to that hashtag. Who's gonna see something like that and not at least Twitter/Google it? If i took the time to carefully plan it all out, u think it could have at least some impact on getting exposure to those around me? Who knows, maybe it would even catch on and start springing up across the country?</p>
<p>Im aware this could be a fucking retarded idea, but i have the best of intentions and just want to do anything i can to help nail these people. </p></p>

        <p><p>I actually like the idea... you could also print small papers with #PizzaGate and randomly throw them at public places... or even the paper saying: DO NOT GOOGLE #PizzaGate  (this could actually attract more people) </p></p>

        <p><p>I was thinking simply googling "pizzagate" wouldn't turn up anything pertinent on the front page... I was wrong... the very top result is a news story with a headline ""Pizzagate": How 4Chan Uncovered the Sick World of Washington's Occult Elite"</p>
<p>The 5th or 6th one down the list is a link directly to this sub... with how badly Google was skewing results pre-election I figured this stuff would be buried deep. </p></p>

        <p><p>Just that top result is enough... Anyone that clicked on it would find so much well organized information that they would prolly nope out before the end of the article knowing how terrible it all is. </p>
<p>http://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/pizzagate-4chan-uncovered-sick-world-washingtons-occult-elite/</p>
<p>Damn... there is even a sports site with an article about it. </p>
<p>edit - even this Inquisitr article claiming to debunk the theory does a really really good job of pointing people towards resources that will help them decide for themselves. </p>

        <p><p>I like the idea of getting the attention out to the public. But maybe a poster or something more official would be more effective. Like the posters created about Hillary's "spirit cooking." Link posted below </p>

        <p><p>Absolutely retarded.</p>
<p>What we need to do is get to people with a bigger audience, spamming different vlogging youtubers, prolific twitter users, fuck even just smaller political figures to investigate or at least comment on it until something happens. Somewhere someone big enough is going to give, and it'll hit main news sites at which point we've done our job.</p></p>

        <p><p>I love the brainstorming, and ANYTHING will help, but I have to agree with above. The best bet is to email/ call / moderately popular people such as YouTube stars/ podcasters/ bloggers etc any American with a voice and moderate following and convince them to air this. </p>
<p>This won't be won by going for big fish. The big fish are PURPOSEFULLY ignoring for different reasons. It will be much easier getting random people with moderate followings. Again think of anyone with that platform and reach out any way you can. A mass of them will make a difference</p></p>

        <p><p>Do both. Don't discount anything. The most effective advertising strategy is the "shotgun" effect, where you use every and any means to advertise.</p></p>
