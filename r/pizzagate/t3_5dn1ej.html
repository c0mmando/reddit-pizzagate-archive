<strong>Not sure if important or not. Magician charged with child porn, Las Vegas</strong>
<p><p>So this has been making news out here in vegas, and when I heard "Entertainment Industry" and "Child Porn Charges" I immediately thought of you glorious autists. Not trying to be disinfo, but if it's related I'd hate for it to get missed. </p>

<p>Look through that and you will see some pretty big players in exploitation and kiddie porn going down all over the country... the FBI doesn't provide the salacious details, but there is enough information for people to connect dots on their own to root out connections. </p></p>

<p><p>Disclaimer: I've literally done no research on this. The headline and radio description I caught this morning was what made me think of pizzagate. </p></p>

<p><p>The pizza places are the end users in a chain of trafficking... the FBI  press releases cover them shutting down the more major operations... the distributors. FBI takes care of the big boys... pizzagate get all the low level rats scared. Fear is a powerful tool... frightened people make mistakes and cut deals. </p>
<p>Everyone should keep digging, but to focus just on Comet for 2 weeks straight is a waste of time... There are thousands of other places all over america... and not just pizza places that we should focus on. If anyone finds any really solid connections... more than just innuedno  remember that https://tips.fbi.gov/ exists and should be used. </p></p>

<p><p>Keep these fuckers scared and they will make mistakes. The ones doing the dirty work for the elites are not the smartest bunch, just easily manipulated. They will get nervous and make mistakes. The can't trust anyone right now</p></p>

<p><p>I suspect Las Vegas to be a hot spot. Check out secret pizza in the cosmopolitan. Reallllly scetchy. A lot of yelp reviews say how the pizza is sub bar but a lot of celebs love it.</p></p>

<p><p>Please don't just post anything related to pedo/CP unless it is linked specifically to pizzagate somehow.  It's just spam, try to use your head.</p></p>

<p><p>You never know whether it's connected or not before digging though, do you? For example; when I watched the documentary about the Hollywood stuff I assumed it was unrelated until I googled names that were in the documentary. One of the people involved in the ring was Brock Pierce, who now works for Clinton Global Initiative. You never know where you will find a link.</p></p>

<p><p>To be fair, the only reason I linked it was because of the entertainment industry link as well. If it were anything else, I'd have shrugged it off completely. I'm not a great investigator, so I figured I'd just make it known, whether it was important or not.</p></p>
