<p>Hillary was sent on a UN envoy to Haiti to save the stupid christians. Standard practice for our government when Americans get themselves in trouble in other countries. http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/02/05/haiti.arrests/ - "Former President Bill Clinton, the U.N. envoy to Haiti, said Haitian leaders don't want the issue to become a distraction to the recovery effort."</p>
<p>Also a pizza place owner that has ping pong has references to pizza and ping pong in his life? What a travesty.</p>
<p>Apparently, Americans can't joke about violence when every fucking movie jokes about violence and jokes are commonly about violence in our society.</p></p>

<p><p>No one said that having a heart was suspicious.</p>
<p>No one said handkerchief maps are uncommon (although they are now, if you look at your own search, you'll see they're all very very old): what was said is that a "pizza related map" on a handkerchief is suspicious. And how important it was to get it back to him.</p>
<p>No one said that Podesta isn't a good cook. We know he is. We ALSO know that he is a good spirit cooker (there is proof of this, which you failed to address). I'm a good cook: I don't do spirit cooking. I don't actually know what kind of non-sequitur you're trying to argue here.</p>
<p>Besta pizza logo: yah that might be a very unfortunate co-incidence. Of all the mom and pop pizza places I've been to, I've never seen anyone make a logo like that. So, a very unlikely co-incidence at best.</p>
<p>Clintons in Haiti: thar be dragons. We'll save that one for 2017.</p>
<p>Glad to have you around. Just let's try to address the evidence. Don't build a straw man out of some of our speculations: we know there is varying level of "confirmation" or evidence behind these data points.</p></p>

<p><p>The image in this post itself shows the heart associated with the FBI pedo relation.</p>
<p>Having a map to your own business is not uncommon for owners to give out to clients.</p>
<p>John Podesta was not associated with Spirit Cooking but only his brother. He didn't respond to any of the emails that his brother sent regarding attending the event. Don't neglect to tell people that Spirit Cooking is an ART EVENT that many famous personas in our society have paid to visit. The blood, semen, whatever is all simulated in what culminates into a liberal art.</p>
<p>I am providing contextual information. I at the minimum actually read and watch everything posted to try to verify the claims that I read on this sub.</p></p>

<p>This has been disproven long ago. Abramovic stated that when in private, it's not art. Performance art is for the public.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John Podesta was not associated with Spirit Cooking but only his brother.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's inconclusive. We do know that <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/16498">John Podesta personally invited Abramovic to Hillary's campaign launch</a>. There were a lot of people in the world he could have invited, but  Abramovic was one of the few. It's the equivalent to inviting your pastor.</p></p>

<p><p>If you read the headers on the email, Tony Podesta sent the email to John about her. In fact here is the header to who she responded to:</p>
<p>From: Marina Abramovic <a href="mailto:marinaxabramovic@gmail.com&lt;mailto:marinaxabramovic@gmail.com">marinaxabramovic@gmail.com&lt;mailto:marinaxabramovic@gmail.com</a>&gt;
Date: June 2, 2015 at 8:31:22 PM EDT
To: info@hillaryclinton.com<a href="mailto:info@hillaryclinton.com">info@hillaryclinton.com</a>, Tony Podesta <a href="mailto:podesta@podesta.com&lt;mailto:podesta@podesta.com">podesta@podesta.com&lt;mailto:podesta@podesta.com</a>&gt;</p>
<p>It was sent to info@hilllaryclinton.com and to Tony. It is obvious Tony really wanted to make it work with this artist, but John wasn't actually involved in this email either. Titled as so because he is head of the campaign. But do you actually believe that just because she thinks it is not art in private that it is not art to the people who pay her to show up?</p></p>

<p>I've participated (not necessarily as a believer) in just about every religion (that isn't Satanic) on the planet. At no point have I ever dismissed what was surrounding me as "art". It isn't art. It's worship. Abramovic even draws a very clear distinction.</p>
<p>If Marina Abramovic says it's part of her religion and worship, and all these Hollywood celebs and unelected rulers claim that it's just "art", then they're very insensitive. You know that's not the case: you're trying to normalize their behavior in ways we would never allow in our own life.</p></p>

<p><p>Look I grew in in California. I am surrounded by this behavior. This is normal behavior in my life. Death Metal, Punk Rock, Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, etc. I am sure the south would throw up going to watch themes of death. The music and art scene includes every walk of life here and that includes themes of hell, the devil and death. Los Angeles... the city of angles. lol.</p></p>

<p><p>not that we shouldn't be critical of the things that are tipping us off, but it's disingenuous to go one by one being like, "oh this can be explained, and this is the reason for that..."  </p>
<p>It's the fact that all of these things together are piling up together and connections are being made all over the place.</p>
<p>If you're keen on writing stuff off, what do you think about Monica Peterson mysteriously dying in Haiti this past weekend when she specifically went there to investigate the Clinton Foundations ties to human trafficking? </p></p>

<p><p>I'm not just writing stuff off just to do it. I came here with an open mind, but became thoroughly disappointed to the veracity of the story being constructed. Few people actually reading sources and fact checking, but blindly sharing videos/images that were truly being disingenuous. I have actually read and watched what people show me. It takes me time to actually go through things because I like to check back stories and facts. I wouldn't be here if I didn't enjoy it.</p>
<p>For me to be disingenuous I would need to be keeping a truth from people. I am releasing people of some dishonest "facts". This post isn't written as inflammatory as some others, for that I commend the person who made it. It just looks ridiculous when people post something completely false and comments poor in with "fucking sick... We need to stop these people" and up voted hundreds. And then I have to hear this story as fact irl from 13 to 50 year olds who fully believe that the Clinton campaign is full of pedo's and won't even pay a whisper of attention to understand the sources, back stories, and claims. What about Comet, the artists, besta pizza, etc. being harassed IRL with being called pedophiles and threatened.</p>
<p>You have some reasonable people here, but most want to satisfy a sick need to construct their own narrative in their heads without verifying and then go out and accuse everyone as if they were hard facts. Many of you lost this investigation just by not appropriately modding this sub and allowing these sick fucks and i mean the ones that participated in sharing this poorly constructed story of pedophile rings to the public. Even worse this was used as ammunition especially by t_d during the election as propaganda. This was brigaded into many parts of reddit. It is obvious I don't get brigaded here. I get little attention here. Few votes either way, but you need reasonable people because you are in short supply. In fact nobody in power has paid attention because you have probably already hurt many innocent people without any solid evidence even with all the private organization emails available to everyone. The one thing that would truly show something... doesn't.</p></p>

<p><p>i share your concern for holding back on certain conclusions.  especially on stuff like that kid screaming in that one video taken across from comet.  but there is plenty of stuff that raises eyebrows, and considered in whole- they paint a pretty grim picture.  It's useful insofar as it gets people interested enough to read into the more damning evidence.  </p>
<p>as for the emails, they would be aware that they can't be out in the open with it.  Podesta made that rather clear in one email to HRC acknowledging he knew the channel wasn't secure enough for certain talk.  </p>
<p>Moderation may indeed need to be stepped up as momentum grows, I'll give you that.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm sorry for replying rather late here but I just found your comment now and I felt like you're open to a discussion regarding Monica Peterson.  </p>
<p>I don't know what your source is for her investigating the Clinton Foundations ties to human trafficking. Lets step back for one second and assume she wasn't, but it was completely unrelated to Clintons and her investigations had nothing to do with them. What would her organization think of the people accusing the Clintons of her death? What could they possibly comment? Because they've made a few comments on their facebook page regarding it: <br/>
https://www.facebook.com/CenterOnHumanRightsEducation/  </p>
<p>Furthermore what I'd like to comment regarding Monica Peterson is that she was an Anthropoligist looking to do solid research on human trafficking, not investigations. It doesn't make sense to me why an Anthropologist doing research would be focusing on the Clintons or any one organization.  </p>
<p>And last of all someone researching human trafficking in a country such as a Haiti is surely under high-risk.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>If we actually give one fuck about pizzagate or potentially the children involved, I'd argue that those here which are skeptical about this are worth 100x more than someone here who just agrees.</strong></p>
<p>If our objective is the pursuit of truth, we would be encouraging people here to be as skeptical as possible.</p>
<p>As an outsider, I can say that the summary presented by this subreddit is far from good enough. However, If anyone thinks the summary misses some incredibly useful information (ie not a tweet that is "weird"), then please point me in the right direction.</p>
<p>The allegations implied by pizzagate are enormous, don't expect anyone outside of the anti-democrat bubble to believe this, at least not based on the "summary" evidence.</p></p>

<p><p>The symbolism in the logos and the handkerchief map are code words for a reason, so one never knows the truth unless they're in on it. Anyone can make the case there's nothing to see there, that's the point of hidden codes. </p>
<p>The reason pizzagate exploded is because of the Instragram page of jimmycomet which you conveniently left out of your bullet list here. You're not able to defend that, so in typical record correcting fashion you just redirect the conversation to the things that are open to interpretation and ambiguous enough to cast doubt, you should try for a job at the nytimes they need more investigators like you.</p></p>

<p><p>This is so much more relevant and compelling than the bullshit currently sitting at the top of the page with 1300+ points.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Granted there's still some silly conclusions being made here.  The instagram pic with British currency is easily explainable as Alefantis and friends musing over the possibility of opening another Comet Ping Pong location in London.  The photo of a giant freezer isn't really that weird since Alefantis owns a restaurant.

<p><p>I've worked in a dive bar with a freezer about that size. There's 22 types of beer on <a href="http://www.cometpingpong.com/menu/">Comet's menu</a>, it has to be stored somewhere, so the freezer's probably full of kegs, etc. Then there's a bunch of wines, cheeses, etc....couple days worth of all of it. </p></p>

<p><p>I don't know about the handkerchief. Although it also could mean nothing at all. Not enough context.</p>
<p>As to the smiling girl taped to the table: do none of you have children? Kids do screwball stuff all the time. And parents take pictures because it was funny, and post on social media.</p>
<p>As to the so called "kill room": have none of you ever made an off colour joke at a friend's expense on social media? </p>
<p>I mean, let's face it: if you really were killing people, are you going to take a picture of the room, post it on IG and make jokes about it being a murder room?? It strains credibility.</p>
<p>There enough to dislike about Clinton without projecting this bizarre Satanist-pedophilia tale onto it.</p></p>

<p><p>You're looking for an explanation other than what's blatantly obvious. Sure her parents could've been goofing around, but for someone associated with confirmed pedophiles, and an owner of an establishment with erotic imagery and shows, "Sex stains" but that advertises to be a family place, posts numerous pictures of children that aren't his, without their parents in the shot in weird situations is not normal.</p></p>

<p><p>Sorry, who are the confirmed pedophiles?</p>
<p>And I personally find their taste in art distasteful and ugly, but it again doesn't prove anything. There are a lot of modern artists who use shocking imagery, but it's a long bow to draw to connect art work to sexual proclivities. Do the millions of Americans who enjoy violent movies also go out and bash or murder people?</p>
<p>I just don't get how this sub seems to regard this as an open and shut case without a shred of even circumstantial evidence, just a bunch of emails and pictures that they find "suspicious".</p>
<p>And to get in before "shill" gets thrown around: I live in Australia and have no personal interest whatsoever in US politics. I'm just nonplussed at the witch hunt hysteria in this sub. It's all very echo chamber.</p></p>

<p><p>Having pictures of half naked preteens all over your house says a lot. It says even more that people that people in his art collecting circle were creeped out by it. </p>
<p>There are too many weird emails and connections for any sane person to make excuses at this point. </p>
<p>Now, the reason that people high upb in the government are involved is yet to be determined. It could be solely for blackmail or money, it could be that these people have all the resources to do it without getting caught, or it could be some mixture of everything.</p></p>

<p><p>There are exactly 2 possible explanations for the girl being taped that matter.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The girl us a sex slave who's smiling despite being strapped to a table by pedophiles. This is possibly because they're using incredibly flimsy tape, or because she's in the public ping pong area, as can be seen by the ping-pong table behind her. The pedo ring, which allegedly has ties to the highest level of national security, posts this image publicly on instagram instead of a secure channel, knowing that pedophiles will understand exactly what's happening here despite the lack on anything clear, and knowing that no one will happen to recognize the girl and blow the whole operation right there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Literally anything else. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Which seems more likely to you?</p></p>

<p><p>Maybe her parents were just being silly, it's not like that tape can hold down even a little girl if she really tries to struggle. Maybe the map is just a back of a napkin sketch of potential places to either move to or spots for a second location, without seeing the actual "map" we have no idea what it is other than that it can be described as a "pizza related map." He'll it might be directions to the store from the "cabin" they were in. The "kill room" is obviously a walk in cooler which in my experience are usually delivered to a location whole. They might have just had it delivered and someone took a picture to show the size of the newer one. Filled with shelves and food it looks like a walk in, but if there's nothing in it it can look just like a "kill room" and it's possible that someone seeing this picture made a joke knowing full well its intended use was cold storage of food products. The person under them might also be playing off that joke when they said "just wash it out when you're done." The fact is this subject seems to be running on complete supposition, and occams razor would suggest it's more likely to be innocuous than malevolent. </p>
<p>Then again that's just my 2cents on the matter. </p></p>

<p><p>Occams razor actually suggests we are in the middle of a pedo ring, not the opposite. Do we need a video of a kid in the basement, with one of them holding the company sign, to believe that something is going on there? You either have not gone deep into what has been found (as the culprits started covering their tracks) or you are a troll trying to discourage those of us who are onto something.</p></p>

<p><p>Yes, certain comments can be written off.  But there is definitely something off about Alefantis' posts.  The most troubling one by far is the one with all the British Pound notes and two bottles containing most likely <strong>alprazolam, which can be a date rape drug.</strong> </p>

<p><p>The picture he posts with the two medicine bottles and huge stacks of cash failed to crop out the first three letters of the drug name, "Alp..."  It's not absolute proof because there are <a href="https://www.drugs.com/alpha/a15.html">other drugs starting with alp</a>, but if we can all be honest, that makes the most sense considering the level of excitement of his post and the replies. "Ooo ping pong in london is tempting." </p></p>

<p><p>Sure, it's only pictures, but you have to keep in mind that these people are the ones literally writing the laws in this country. They've been finding loopholes around this stuff for so long, I can assure you they know exactly what and what wouldn't be incriminating. </p>
<p>Furthermore, honest question for you. Nothing about this seems "off?" to you? To use an analogy, Like you're sitting on a wobbly chair and even though the legs all look the same length, you still are off balance? </p></p>

<p><p>To be honest, I think that if you cherry picked a bunch of photos and comments from most people's social media accounts you could create almost any narrative. Think of how many inside jokes, references to past events and random shit you might include in FB or IG with your friends. </p></p>

<p><p>Personally I stay away from Facebook and Instagram. If George Soros funded progaganda and the NSA/CIA want to disinform me, steal my personal information, location, friendlist, and store all of my private conversations in a server out in Utah, I sure as hell won't hand it over to them for free. </p>
<p>Back on topic though. Even if these are "inside jokes," anyone with common business sense would make those "jokes" on a personal account, and not their Restaurant's business IG. Especially when it's advertised as family friendly. </p>
<p>You sort of avoided my question though. You really don't see anything "off" or "fishy" about any of this? For me it's just a sort of gut instinct, sinking feeling. </p></p>

<p><p>Frankly, no. Mostly because I don't have any context. </p>
<p>I can't peruse this account, which is now private. What is being presented is a curated set of screen grabs, reach with breathless near hysterical commentary. I mean the first part of this that got my attention, which was the pizza logo thing, is so absurd as to be laughable. If is quite literally looking for shapes in the clouds.</p>
<p>The only sinking feeling I get is the notion watching this sub that this is the mood which must have been in the air in Salem before the witch trials. Everyone here seems to have completely thrown rationality and scepticism out of the window out of the burning desire to believe that all of this is true.</p></p>

<p><p>You're right. There isn't any direct evidence; it's all circumstantial at this point. So of course there will be multiple explanations for the facts gathered at this point. There are, however, too many weird coincidences to simply abandon the "investigation" all together. Assuming there is something to this stuff, then we are dealing with a totally criminal enterprise. They aren't going to not cover their tracks. Sure, some of this stuff probably has a reasonable explanation, but at the same time, how many odd coincidences is the average person involved in that connects them to pedophilia? This obviously deserves investigating.</p></p>

<p><p>Very nicely done.
I think adding some more verifiable "mainstream" info would be good.
Not going overboard but two things that the public already know about that could help with credibility:</p>
<p>1) The Epstein connections (since he's a convicted in court offender)
2) The 850k blackmail by Alefantis on David Brock (head of Media Matters)</p>
<p>Those are very public and need the dots connected iMO.</p>
<p>Still, really nice summary!</p></p>

<p><p>Also the fact that Tony Podesta was in Japan with Dennis Hastert " teaching kids".
As you know Hastert is a convicted admittedly guilty molester.<br/>
The amount of circumstantial evidence pointing to the fact the Podestas are pedophiles is overwhelming</p></p>

<p><p>This particular email I'm referring to isn't part of the Podesta files, so I'm not exactly sure what you're referring to, but Stratfor definitely seems to be involved in this grand scheme somehow. Their "beta international PIZZA delivery" website is still rather inexplicable, plus they are really, really into hotdogs. This is an intelligence consulting firm, by the way. Has nothing to do with food OR delivery of any product.</p></p>

<p><p>To be fair, the image DOES describe them as a separate chain of emails, albeit they are positioned next to each other in a somewhat confusing manner.</p>
<p>It could be fishy, since the "hotdog waitresses" email is specifically a STRATFOR internal communication among their employees. STRATFOR themselves aren't really related to Podesta directly in many ways, but I think we can all agree they've come up more than a few times during this investigation for various reasons. </p>
<p>I currently can't find the "International Pizza Delivery" website on their domain, but I'm sure it's been archived somewhere.</p>
<p>I have a hard time thinking /u/TheyCryWolf would be some kind of disinfo guy, so I'll just chalk it up to a bad Paint job, huehuehue.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm still unclear on WTF your argument is here. I looked around at a few of the links and read what you have in the image... but your accusations are VERY vague. </p>
<p>From what I gather, there appears to be a suspected child pedophilia ring and you seem to be insinuating that Podesta is a member and that Clinton is aware. However, the proof in the image is circumstantial and requires a massive leap of faith. Hell, I want to believe. I just expected more than blurry images of Big Foot and an empty roll of tin foil. </p></p>

<p><p>yea- no.  This is evidence of nothing except the fact that kids throw temper tantrums.  It's at a time when families are evidently walking around.  So even if the scream wasn't coming from the kid walking with his parents, we could deduce that it's coming from any other kid in the vicinity.  We absolutely cannot say the kid is calling for help.  People are just hearing what they want to hear.  Has no one who believes this heard a kid throw a temper tantrum?  Judging by your post history, I don't think you're shilling weak shit, but please consider that among ALL the info we can promote around this-- this content is just not that big of a red flag.  </p></p>
