    Has anyone managed to make any links to Mexico? Opportunity to get real work done
   </strong>

    Ok, so I've been redpilling my international friends in central America and they want to know how they can help. They aren't located in USA so all the pizzagate stuff happening in DC is irrelevant to them (although if anyone can link that stuff to Mexican officials / businessmen then great)
   </p>
   <p>
    I know Carlos Slim is big supporter of CGI/CF. Has anyone made any links between him or anything?
   </p>
   <p>
    I guess it will be standard procedure of:
   </p>
   <p>
    1) see which Mexican politicans / business men donated to CF/CGI etc
   </p>
   <p>
    2) see which Mexican politicans / business men attended CF/CGI etc events
   </p>
   <p>
    3) see what children related organisations/charities they have donated to
   </p>
   <p>
    4) see what sort of political appointments those politicans have been making in Mexican DoJ equivalent etc
   </p>
   <p>
    5) see whether those appointments are linked to any potential businesses same way Andrew Kiline was.
   </p>
   <p>
    6) see if any Mexico-Haiiti links
   </p>
   <p>
    If nothing has been done on this front already happy to start looking myself but would love any pointers.
   </p>
   <p>
    Lets just say not all Federales are willing to let this stuff happen.

    What are the elements that leads you to the figure of Carlos Slim about pizzagate? I already saw his face somewhere here but I can't remember...

     as i said this is me branching the investigation out into Mexico/Central America.
    </p>
    <p>
     If we follow the same steps it should lead to the same results.
    </p>
    <p>
     plus we also have shitloads of trafficking/illegal immigration into USA FROM Mexico. So it makes sense if this is happening there &amp; also is a supply route.
    </p>
    <p>
     All im asking is if anyone has any starting points from which i can start digging / point people in the right direction.

      I searched in the sub "Carlos Slim". Here's what I found. Hope it'll help you !
     </p>
     <p>
      $20 million off the book donation to Clinton Foundation, from Carlos Slim (Mexican Billionaire), intended to help Haiti but were it exactly went to help isn't known and isn't publicly discussed? http://nypost.com/2016/11/05/the-clinton-foundations-off-the-books-20-million-mystery/
