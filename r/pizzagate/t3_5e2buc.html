<p><p>Holy shit you guys. <strong>READ THIS.</strong> It's the first testimony on the list. Extremely scary stuff... the stuff nightmares are made of.</p>
<p>"<em>I would like to draw your attention to some extreme and horrendous criminality being conducted with the involvement of United States Government-related Agencies and the complicity, if not participation, of many other governments, security agencies and/or shadowy organizations - involving the use of DIRECTED ENERGY AND NEUROLOGICAL WEAPONS on defenceless people.</em></p>
<p>*I can confirm that the technical abilities and powers to:- </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>place a human subject under continuous surveillance, no matter where he/she is, from remote locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuously monitor a human brain from remote locations, including thought, reaction, motor command, auditory event and visual image reading</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuously input directly into a human brain from remote locations, including the ability to override, control and alter consciousness, and to introduce voices, noises, other disturbances, images and “dreams” into the brain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>directly interfere with, abuse, torture and hit bodies - including performing advanced medical procedures - and objects - from remote locations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>directly interfere with, alter, insert etc. data, files, communications and legal evidence from remote locations - even during transmission</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make live TV, and other screens and monitors, two-way – for surveillance, invasion of privacy etc..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>control the flow of information and orchestrate the media – worldwide.*</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>ARE ALREADY IN EXISTENCE AND ARE ALREADY BEING ABUSED!</em></p>
<p><em>There is massive ignorance and secrecy regarding this, and victims such as I are being subjected to uncontrolled and unacknowledged torture and mental and physical destruction. This has remained completely unreported and undiscussed publicly. There are many others, all over the world, who are being subjected to similar torture and abuse – some of us are being subjected to the most extreme
and totalitarian violations of human rights in human history."</em></p></p>

<p><p>Thank you! I see the email is from Stratfor - who, judging by their product listings, are very interested in globalization, with even a handy-dandy guide on the "New World Order."</p>

<p>I'm beginning to think, if you can conceive of something, no matter how awful or radical, it's in the Podesta emails - or within WL.</p></p>

<p><p>Aaric Eisenstein seems to be involved in a lot, well educated, and holds fairly important positions. He's not just average joe sending emails around Stratfor.</p>
<p>Some words from the horse's mouth, so-to-speak: http://www.personalizedmedia.com/about-team-aeisenstein.asp</p>
<p>He was also in the "Hot Dog Fridays" emails talking about "waitresses", coincidentally enough. Great find! 10/10</p>

<p><p>This is insane. What's scary is all the so called "conspiracy theories" that everyone claims are nuts are all being brought to light. </p>
<p>I love Alex Jones &amp; David Icke but took things they said with a grain of salt, however all the theories they have talked about are all coming to fruition. As far as elites politicians and pedophilia, mind control etc...</p>
<p>Scary times. I just wonder the lengths the elites would go if the whole kit and kaboodle gets exposed. Will they just lash out and start mass depopulation re: Georgia Guide Stones . It makes you wonder.</p></p>

But here are 100 cases, from around the world, all saying the same thing and the email being forwarded by some head honcho. Did he forward it as an LOL of some kind, and if so, which kind?</p></p>

<p><p>The long-term plan is overall pretty simple.</p>
<p>1) Cause minor instability in a developed region.</p>
<p>2) Use minor instability as excuse to expand certain specific sections of governmental authority and private sector "freedom."</p>
<p>3a) The ever-so-slow and gradual process of rights and freedoms erosion is done at a pace where by the time a citizen realizes the floormat was stolen out from under them they're 50-60 and the new generations don't realize what they never had.</p>
<p>3b) Utilize the Fourth Estate, the media, to control the greater public narrative.</p>
<p>Where they want to go long-term is anyone's guess.</p>
<p>This is a non-partisan effort across the world. Republic and Democrat, Liberal and Tory.</p></p>

<p><p>I pretty much agree with all of this, from #1 to #3b. If you take them all into consideration all of the above seem to have been implemented here in the USA. </p>
<p>1 &amp; 2, the instability caused by the racial divide Obama has caused and also the plight of the Blue Collar Working Class that were forgotten about by this administration. </p>
<p>3a, "the new generations dont realize what they had" is a perfect example of the imbecile Millenials with there safe spaces and shutting down of free speech with political correctness.</p>
<p>3b, speaks for itself. we all know the games MSM has played the last few years and especially now with this election cycle, with disinformation and slander.</p></p>

<p><p>These look like emails submitted via a form. They all have the same template. Then John Finch compiled them into the document and sent it to someone he thought would listen to his crazy and it went viral within Stratfor.</p>
