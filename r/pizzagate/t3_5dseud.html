        <strong>Looking for a concise TL;DR on pizzagate for a poker buddy...</strong>
        <p><p>Basically it came up, and he knew nothing about it. I was wondering if anyone could link me up a good infographic or summary I can text/email over. I know 4chan had some stuff floating around but at this point things have progressed significantly. </p></p>

        <p><p>Depends how deep you want to dive... TL;DR a bunch of emails were uncovered that had strange references to pizzarias. Turns out pedophiles have a code language that involves pizzerias. The podestas are getting the most/strongest accusations, they have weird pedo art, and they have ties to a known pedophile, and they have weird emails. The pizza place that's getting the most heat is this place called commet pizza... Family friendly, strange massive underground refrigerator, strange owner who posts weird pedo stuff to Twitter, and strange ties to democratic campaigns. Fundraisers are held there. </p>
<p>Modestly on the spectrum of pizzagate: the podestas  are pedophiles, and you shouldn't eat at pizzerias in Washington if you have kids.</p>
<p>Wilder theories, but still have growing evidence: Clintons and Obama are involved and have trafficked and abusee children. The podestas and Anthony Weiner are actively kidnapping children.</p></p>

        <p><p>No problem..</p>
<p>Also send him this video:</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9vwQGlY00E</p>
<p>Its known as the Hampstead coverup.</p>
<p>These kids were abused, forced to participate in ritual sacrifice and literally chop off babies heads with their dad and eat the babies.</p>
<p>This is them coming clean to their grandpa.</p>
<p>It was all covered up.</p>
<p>There are other interviews with these kids by the police.</p>
<p>Warning: video is very upsetting .</p>
<p>You can tell the children are being honest and its so detailed.</p></p>

        <p><p>I saw that one on front page, but that one really starts out badly by doing things like showing a blurry image of the painting in bedroom, and trying to say he's a pedo because he has stuffed animals. I was trying to find more of a concise version of where the links are made between the emails, players involved, etc. Maybe I'll not be lazy, drink some coffee and try to survive in 4chan for a bit.</p></p>
