        <p><p>Found the pizza</p>
<p>http://www.babystepsdaycare.net/portfolio/cheese-pizza/</p>
<p>Edit: before this gets out of hand it looks like there is mandate from NB government to document the menu at a daycare in that province. We have to realize there are going to be some cheese and pizza references that are benign. </p>
<p>http://www2.gnb.ca/content/dam/gnb/Departments/ed/pdf/ELCC/ECHDPE/DayCareOperatorStandards.pdf</p>
<p>Edit2: u/Ninjakick666 referenced a theory around Dept. of health being in involved in food related child trafficking specifically involving instances of food with a C+ rating, which is is the rating applied to the cheese pizza at this daycare. I've done some research but haven't been able to find anything on this, does anyone else have any insight? </p></p>

        <p><p>Weird. If you back up one page in the breadcrumb it's just a blog of various food nutritional value without any kind of context. What is this?</p></p>

        <p><p><strong>"C+ Grade"</strong> - I ran into other possible pedo rings using different slang than just pizza... "Curry Lane" it seemed to hint that you could use health code inspection lookups to flag what places had the goods... But that looked to be from around 2008. </p></p>

<p>He's a <a href="https://archive.is/LJwke">culinary school graduate</a>, a <a href="https://archive.is/zl3Zx">concierge</a> and captured a couple possible(?) faces next to <a href="https://archive.is/wX0TN">stilt banana woman</a>. </p>
<p>You already knew that he's a <a href="https://archive.is/6nBzo">licensed massage therapist</a>. </p>
<p>All of this right next to Epstein's island. </p></p>

        <p><p>I checked the questionnaire. Its very basic info. </p>
<p>Paraphrased: </p>
<p>Name address email etc</p>
<p>How often do you dine here</p>
<p>Which location</p>
<p>You usually: dine in, takeout, delivery</p>
<p>Do you go to our competitors, which one, how often</p>
<p>Overtly, it looks like a program for "undercover diners." Restaurants (some) do this to keep their staff from getting lazy for fear of customers being agents for the management staff. </p>
<p>Don't take me on my word; I encourage everyone else to take a look in case i missed something.</p></p>

        <p><p><strong>Edit: Also if you use their search function: http://www.babystepsdaycare.net/?s=pizza</strong></p>
<p>Ok so I am totally new to this /r/pizzagate news (apparently been living under a rock) but perhaps this is what the serve to kids and the only reason I say this is because if you look further into the images uploaded to the WordPress media folder you'll see a lot of food item images: http://www.babystepsdaycare.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ or the main folder: http://www.babystepsdaycare.net/wp-content/uploads/</p>
<p>Also I know that when my nephew goes to daycare, he's served a lunch and is told in advance what the food, snacks and beverages will be.</p>
<p>Also please note it could be theme based, as in whatever theme they used they could have had the site populated with images http://whatwpthemeisthat.com/</p></p>

        <p><p>Straight lines. Leaning over the boat is a much more plausible explanation. Still doesn't explain why it was hidden on his vacationconcierge site the same way the cheesepizza.jpg was hidden on his babysitter site.</p>
<p>Could be nothing. Could be something.</p>
<p>He has a picture of himself from behind masturbating outdoors on his facebook. Something isn't right.</p></p>

        <p><p>Calm down dude. I live on the coast and remembered my jellyfish stings looking like that; I don't need to Google it. I apologize for trying to add to the conversation. Plus there's pictures that look just like that in that google search you linked. I voted for trump btw, at least throw me some cherries from your tree.</p></p>

        <p><p>All good. My plausible explanation was leaning over the boat.</p>
<p>The way the picture was hidden in the site, the same way the cheese pizza picture was hidden, was the main cause of suspicion, for me.</p></p>

        <p><p>Lmao you're right. But explain to me what it is..or, could be? And does it not look like they are purposely trying to make sure they have these markings in the pic front and center. Almost as an advertisement.. they could've easily put a shirt on the kid. Or at least tried to get a dif angle.</p></p>

<p>And if you click on his wife's catering business page it appears to be in Chinese? Weren't there emails in Chinese in the Podesta emails? Interesting. </p>

        <p><p>Please dont be mad at the noobs for being noobs. They/we genuinely dont know about archiving stuff.</p>
<p>Can you / would you be willing to create a post that walks us through how to create an archive? Or pastebin? Or whatever the best method is?</p>
<p>I cannot be the only one who does not know how to do that. And, if the mods could sticky it, that would be awesome.</p></p>

        <p><p>I tried that and kept getting an error. I'm on mobile so not sure if it was that. Would you be able to archive those links in my OP? I will keep archiving in mind from now on but don't want to lose these if they're important</p></p>

        <p><p>Caught my eye too, but I didn't see a match. <a href="https://www.picsofcelebrities.com/celebrity/alexandra-tydings/pictures/alexandra-tydings-pictures.html">Alexandra Tydings Luzzatto</a> vs <a href="https://archive.is/BWR0B">east hampton babysitter</a></p>
<p>But the coincidences are just too common:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/BWR0B">In September of 2012 we were looking for a part time nanny for our 3 girls (12, 9 and 3). We found East Hampton Babysitters online and gave them a call.</a></p>
<p>compared to:</p>
<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwYvN8qUUAATzIP.jpg">Uber service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzattoo (11, 9, and almost 7) so you'll have some further entertainment...</a></p>
<p>the more i read about the pedo rings in Hollywood and now government the more Alexandra Tydings Luzzatto becomes connected.  What I've always wondered, is what happens to these pedo rings on a generational basis. The parallels seem similar to generational control of banks and governments.  So when you read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Tydings">Tydings</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0878714/bio">and</a> she overlaps all three; entertainment, banker, politics. These children that are traded between adults eventually become adults themselves.... who trade their children.  They keep it in the family and entertainment, political, financial professions.</p>
<p>Some pedos traffic (haiti CPS) and some swap (elite).  Strong ties to Aleister Crowely on a macro scale if you care for that rabbit hole. </p></p>

        <p><p>I haven't seen direct, merely common themes and Modus operandi. Same with Scientology. And its the same people overlapping between pedophilia, occult, Scientology. </p>
<p>For instance, Scientology infiltrated multiple government levels years ago over what some consider tax (IRS) issues.  Scientology has a network of operatives in government positions. Now we have proof that Occultist have a network throughout federal government via spiritdinner group. Scientology infilitrates social media, occult/pedos do the same via Brock's Correct The record. </p>
<p>Hubbard (Scientology) was a follower of Crowley (spiritdinner et al).  They both follow similar indoctrination and mind control steps. </p>
<p>Then there is overlap with pedophilia. Tom cruise and Nicole Kidman are Scientologists. Antony Kidman (Nics father) founded a youth mental illness nonprofit and was a member of "9th circle" pedophile ring. He ran from Sydney police to singapore after his grandaughter accused him of heinous pedo and mind control crimes. </p>
<p>Its way too much overlap to type here and I haven't got my thoughts in order. There is a tie between Scientology and Thelema Occultism.  Perhaps they are different sects entirely that happen to overlap by means of pedophilia and mind control (MK Ultra, nazi shit). Or perhaps they are the same.  The same people, locations and symbols, actions are too common between memebers of each for it to be statistically independent operations. </p>
<p>These are generational occultists. They've been raped since birth, passed around in what appears outwardly as a loving environment, and only know this. To these pedos, pedophilia is the norm. They recognize the general public's negative perception, so they hide it. Some 2nd 3rd gen pedos may think they are being persecuted by the public. Jesus and his disciples were persecuted right? </p></p>

        <p><p>I was able to translate, it's not catering at all. It's a personal blog from a woman referring to herself as an arafo woman. (Woman in her 40s)</p>
<p>Random entries about love interests... weird.</p></p>

        <p><p>Google chrome translate is for whatever reason different from normal google translate.</p>
<p>One section was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am Alfa. I am a male who died in the past, and there are things that I took into consideration for marriage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I was told that I disliked Alfa's idea that I had experienced a little bit of the bubble period.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's Japanese. Google translate is fucking terrible for Japanese so I'm not really going to nitpick details, but it seems like it's just a blog about trying to get married or some shit. Arafu (which I think is Katakana for "Alpha") is either her name/nickname or it's a label. Googling "Arafu" directly gives restaurants called that and a generic Clinton supporter tumblr.</p>
<p>If anybody knows Japanese, feel free to take a look because idk why it's called Molly Rose Catering, but everybody else shouldn't bother translating.</p>
<p>Edit: Arafu is just Alefa when using Japanese phonemes. Its Alefantis.</p></p>

        <p><p>Babysteps is so weird. None of the links really go to anything. The download parent handbook doesn't work. After school programs doesn't work. And programming kids? What weird choice of words.</p>
<p>Edit- I found an index of all the stuff uploaded around the time the pizza pic was. There's a lot of food pics in .jpg format. 3 diff resolutions for each.</p>
<p>Double late edit-in pics referencing cheese and the pizza there are 4 files instead of 3. The odd ones out are just named thefoodtype.jpeg it's probably nothing but I thought it was interesting.</p></p>

        <p><p>Use their search function and you can find them all </p>
<p>Example: http://www.babystepsdaycare.net/?s=pizza </p>
<p>They probably use this for their lunches or something so people have nutrition facts about the food their kids eat. </p>
<p>We can't go witch hunting any establishment that works around kids and uses pizza in someway </p></p>

        <p><p>Psychforums used to attract a load of them. It was awful.. they all wanted to meet up and stuff. Somehow the idea of a massive group of pedophies in one area seems like a really, really bad idea </p></p>

        <p><p>The babystepsdaycare.net image directory where you linked to the pizza image has many many food images:</p>
<p>http://www.babystepsdaycare.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/</p>
<p>It's possible those images may have come with a food related theme for Wordpress, which is the system they are using.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm sorry, but what the hell is it about Peace, Love and Pizza that's Satanic? They have good pizza. And it's organic. And I'm fairly positive they're a pretty far distance from the CNN center and y'all are grasping at straws. </p></p>

        <p><p>Uh, I didn't imply anything other than I don't like being tracked while on this research path. I checked out PLP pretty thoroughly and they seem clean. Can I ask how you got here?</p></p>

        <p><p>I heard a man in the bookstore talk about Clinton's pedo ring and thought he was insane. Additionally, at about 5 am one morning I stumbled on r/pizzagate. I wondered how in the world the story came from Reddit. 'Tis all. </p></p>

        <p><p>I am involved, and working with other parents who are involved, with the Child Protective Services business in the US that steals children from their families and farms them into foster care or adopts them out. We have been trying to find a way to break through the corruption in this business that is run through the family court system. The child trafficking system in the US has been known to the intelligence community. It is my hope that with the added spotlight on the Clinton Foundation and the pedophilia ring that is getting ready to be exposed, that there are some out there that are digging that can help me connect the dots back to the foster care system, the adoption business, and the family court system. Hillary touts as one of her greatest achievements a bill that she helped to push through congress and Bill signed into law in 1997 that was a federal act called the Adoption and Safe Families Act. What it did was to incentivize state governments with federal money to adopt children out, instead of reuniting them with their biological families. Please, if there is anyone out there that can help me, I would greatly appreciate it. Personally, the state of KY has stolen my 7 homeschooled children and held them captive for almost 7 months. I know MANY, MANY families all across the country that are suffering under this system that gets away with stealing children from loving families because the family court system will not give the parents their constitutional rights. I am hoping with this new information coming out about the pedophile ring, we can FINALLY expose the evil deeds of this agency and the foster care system. Please, if you can. If you do come across something and you can't find me or reach me on here you can email the info to me at freethebabies2016@gmail.com or find me on Gab.ai as @MommyLove. Thank you!</p></p>

        <p><p>I would stick to USA for now. Not that I don't believe Canada doesn't have its problems...but I believe a large amount of the previous evidence was heavily localized to DC for a reason. Add too many places and the likelihood of coincidence strengthens. Especially in the eyes of others. </p></p>

        <p><p>Going to copy this comment from another post here as I think it is pertinent.</p>
<p>I'm not a religious man, I'm not a supernatural believer, I'm not very trusting, I'm not one to believe in conspiracy theories that are far out.</p>
<p>However I am one that understands that evil in this world exists and in ways that I could never even fathom. I also understand that just because something sounds outrageous. (One of the things for me, a place like heaven after I die.) I still don't discredit it and write it off, because the absolute truth is that I DONT KNOW and NO ONE has ever truly known.</p>
<p>I think that applies here to a degree considering the amount of smoke billowing out at this point. Do I believe all of this is true? Unlikely, for instance the Obama flying in pizza and hot dogs thing, probably Occam's Razor should apply.</p>
<p>However, there is no denying, once you look through the information at hand that something is off. I mean just the sheer amount of affiliations with known pedo's in this social circle is a cause to be weary. These are actual people that have confessed or were in imprisoned. Solid facts. That are associated with names mentioned throughout.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, how many pedo's do you know or have you known in your social circle throughout your life? Me? None.</p>
<p>Its disconcerting at the least and at the most does call for an discerning eye to sift through and ensure there isn't cause for alarm.</p>
<p>Another thing I'd like to add, and you may judge, is that I did not vote in this election, didn't even pay attention to politics at all. Hell I was watching impressions last night and saw some of Trump and thought, well, I don't know that one because I havn't really watched him speak.</p>
<p>I know, I'm a poor citizen of America for not caring. My point being that I in no way have an agenda for Trump in reference to this scandal. I could give a f about him. I do care about childrens lives, and the evil that can destroy them.</p>
<p>I say all this, and bare with me as I know it sounds cookoo, but is legitimate because think about how they would react if this were true. If there was a higher level/political ring of sorts that was involved in something so Diabolical.</p>
<p>If that were true, then right now there best bet would to make sure that anyone investigating was deemed a "Conspiracy Nut". I mean wouldn't that be the most effective way of dousing the flames. Delete pics, delete weird stuff, hire a few online trolls to get on sites like Reddit and 4chan, where this stuff is breaking, and completely discredit them.</p>
<p>A person going through may be thinking, wow, this actually has some pretty disturbing warning signs. This may need to be investigated. But then read a comment like some on this page and remember, "Oh silly, c'mon, shit like this doesn't happen, look at you being so foolish and thinking something so evil like this could happen."</p>
<p>Evil happens. True evil.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is real, I hope, hope hope, it is not. But, IF IT IS. Just what if it is? We must do something about it. The only way we could something about it is by the general populace accepting it, allowing folks like the FBI to investigate and have the publics support, because without OUR support? Well anyone could scrub off a lone conspiracy nut.</p>
<p>In conclusion, be semi-open minded with a scrutiness eye.</p>
<p>Be weary that people are hired to post "troll" comments on forums to swing opinions.</p>
<p>Lastly, do not doubt the evil in this world, but also do not doubt the good.</p></p>
