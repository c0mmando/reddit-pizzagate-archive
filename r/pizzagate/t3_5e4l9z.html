        <strong>Wasnt CP on Twitter allready known many years ago?</strong>
        <p><p>Hey guys, i found this while searching the web. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvducvDxqEI</p>
<p>I absolutely understand nothing but it seems like he is pointing out that there is CP on twitter, in 2012. Can some one translate? </p>
<p>He also linked to his blog (wich was not updated since 2013):
http://twitter-child-porn.blogspot.se/ 
there is no CP on this blog but many links to pictures wich i dont want to open. </p>
<p>Seems like he wanted to tell us that Twittergate stuff allready in 2012</p>
<p>EDIT: ADDING COMMENTS FROM THE BLOG: </p>
<p>""YLee, May 09 09:43 am (PDT):Hello,
We do not tolerate child pornography on Twitter. When we are made aware of such images they will be removed from the site without further notice.
Due to the overall volume of Trust &amp; Safety requests that we receive, we are unable to provide individual responses to reports. Should we find actionable content in your report, it will be removed; you may need to refresh your browser or clear your browser's history and cache before the content is no longer visible in your browser.
For accounts that have not posted such images, if they are determined to fall within these guidelines (http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/PageServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&amp;PageId=2447 ), we do report them to the National Coalition for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC); law enforcement is then able to review those reports and determine which they believe merit further investigation.
As we are not law enforcement, we cannot engage in offline investigations of violations of the law. However, we do notify law enforcement agencies who can. As such, it's important to remember that simply removing accounts and/or Tweets does not result in the underlying possible criminal act being identified and prosecuted and can instead lead to the removal of evidence that law enforcement may need to determine whether or not charges should be brought and/or an investigation begun.
You are also welcome to file an additional complaint with NCMEC to provide them with context or more information; you'll find the link here: https://secure.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/CybertipServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US
Thanks,
YLee

        <p><p>Maybe i'm missing something here but aren't these twitter pedo accounts basically just your average joe collection of cretins? It seems to me that following this twitter thing is a big distraction. We all know there are tons of plebian pedos in the world and yes, something needs done about them too but we're not here to take on every last little rat out there are we? If nothing else, law enforcement does seem to clean up that breed of sicko but what we're here for are the high profile cases that are running the show world wide. So how in the world are we going to take steps to bring down people like Podesta and Clinton if all we're doing is looking at a bunch of rando twitter accounts?</p></p>

        <p><p>This.</p>
<p>If we were to use the analogy of drug dealers. Taking down the consumers has little to no effect. Even taking down your neighborhood dealer is but a small victory. To dismantle it you must goto the top, what the alphabet boys call the big fish, the ones who deal internationally. </p>
<p>This analogy is especially poignant because these 'big fish' are also our leaders of government and business. They permeate a culture that ALLOWS for the little fish. We must behead the snake and we may live in a pedo free society. </p>
<p>Long live #pizzagate!</p></p>

        <p><p>Youre right this Twitter thing is just stopping investigation progress on podesta. but it should be made public as fast as possible because on twitter is in fact a lot of child porn and this proof fact must be used by the media to make it big. and maybe on some point podesta will get attention too</p></p>

        <p><p>I believe the Twitter thing does need exposed but maybe it needs its own place and its own people focused on it so it doesn't dilute pizzagate research.</p></p>
