        <strong>What's with the no upvotes in this sub?</strong>
        <p><p>Seen communities with 2k active go frontpage regularly. But only a few hundred upvotes here and there and only one with 4k. What am I missing? </p></p>

        <p><p>The mods approved the post.  But please people I think this is a very dangerous route to take.  What if a researcher has breaking evidence and 1 mod is compromised? Reddit users would never see it.  Please message the mods and let them know if you agree.  Some of the top post on this sub came from throwaways and the sidebar tells you to use one.</p></p>
