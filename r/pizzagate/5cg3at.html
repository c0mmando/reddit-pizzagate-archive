   <strong>
    LOOK DEEP. Let's all take closer look at "Heavy Breathing" - the terrifyingly creepy "artist" listed first on Comet Ping Pong website's "friends" section
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    This is far from the smoking gun we need, but maybe someone can make sense out of this and take us to the next step.
   </p>
   <p>
    Look at this video created by "Heavy Breathing"
   </p>
   <p>
    Heavy Breathing "Airtight" album Indiegogo pitch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_gGhrIO6ps
   </p>
   <p>
    Notice the name: AIRTIGHT. What could airtight possibly mean? (I'm sick to my stomach thinking about it)
   </p>
   <p>
    Watch this from start to finish. As you watch it, pay attention to EVERYTHING. Pause the video to look at what props/backgrounds you see on the screen. Watch her hand gestures. Listen to what she says with the perspective that she is using code words to communicate to a particular group of people.  Listen to the tone and pitch of her voice when she says certain things. You will discover several suspicious clues that could lead one to believe this is an advertisement for pedophilia related activity.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here are some VERY notable things you will notice about the video and possible interpretations:
   </p>
   <p>
    Intro -  The video starts out with her making her way through a dark hall. Could this be alluding to underground tunnels or subway systems used to move kids around?
   </p>
   <p>
    0:34 - See how the table/room is reminiscent of the President's office? It even has a coffee mug with the flag and possibly a political figure on the desk. Notice how it is underwater? Alluding further to the idea of it being "underground"
   </p>
   <p>
    0:59 - Photo of this freak and a bunch of orphans. "And my recurring role is (puppet?) in the Broadway smash "orphans and assholes". It's known that a possible source of children is from orphanages and other places where the kids won't have anyone to come looking for them. The mention of "orphans and assholes" makes me SICK.
   </p>
   <p>
    1:11 - "I'm here today to offer you the keys to a life only a chosen few would experience". WHO'S LIFE IS SHE OFFERING? The poor children who are being abused and murdered for their sick pleasure? Notice that she types "80085" on the dialpad (boobs).
   </p>
   <p>
    1:17 - "That key is Heavy Breathing's new full length album Airtight". Remember at the beginning of the video she said "There is no need to speak. I will send my thoughts directly to your mind"? This screen shows her pointing to her head/brain as if she is now about to mentally transmit information to the viewer. The fact that she does this while announcing that they KEY is in her album could imply that whatever "Key" or "code" they need can be found by clues within her album. This is speculation, but it seems very possible.
   </p>
   <p>
    1:47 - "To honor our new record, Airtight, we - Heavy Breathing - wish to offer you a limited time opportunity. At 1:52 she does the dick in pussy sign with her hands... symbolizing the "opportunity" of sex with children being offered?
   </p>
   <p>
    1:55 - "If I told you that I had created a series of 5 rewards that could reshape your mind, body and spirit... how could you not join us and drink from Heavy Breathing's nutrient enhanced and reverse osmosis-filtered well?" At 2:03 you see an image of a naked woman's body with a baby coming out of her vagina. Is this symbolizing the "REWARDS" aka children that are being offered? At 2:07 you see she is pretending to drink something and then she pretends to pass out/go unconscious. Is this a reference to drugging the children? Why would something "Nutrient Enhanced" make her pass out after drinking?
   </p>
   <p>
    2:10 - Shows an infographic of pressure vessels with a 3 stage process. Anyone know what this could mean?
   </p>
   <p>
    2:16 - "Rewards purchased will help Heavy Breathing reach our goal of $1,700. Yes, 1700 dollars to get our new record 'Airtight' pressed into virgin vinyl and onto your turntable."  This sounds like a reference to how much a child will cost, or some other sexual/sick related act. Notice the sick play on words with "virgin vinyl" - did she mean virgin children?
   </p>
   <p>
    3:00 - "For 200$ you can send an email description of a problem or an issue you are struggling with an majestic ape will record an individualized response with suggestions and strategies which she will send you as an MP3 download probably averaging 15 minutes in length". Now, the screen shows her typing an "email". Here are the words in the email:
   </p>
   <p>
    "Dear Majestic Ape,
   </p>
   <p>
    I want to be a rock keyboardist like you, but I only have 3 fingers on each hand, and I'm 4'2".
   </p>
   <p>
    Please help!!"
   </p>
   <p>
    Why would someone pay $200 for suggestions and strategies from her?  What strategies will she give in the 15 minute MP3 recording? Does she mean strategies to get the type of "child" the viewer wants to have? 3+3=6. Is she referring to a 6 year old here? Giving an example of how to "subtly" relay info of what the pedophile is looking for?
   </p>
   <p>
    3:26 - "For $1000 we will play a show at the location of your choice up to an hour away from Washington DC". Images on the screen show a children's bouncy playhouse. Also notice the image of the 4 boys at the table. I recall seeing on 4chan thread last night after someone cracking the embedded images from Podesta emails... there were many photos of some teenage boy in a wheelchair. One of the boys AT THIS TABLE looks like that same teenage boy. Can someone confirm this? I can't find the thread that showed all the photos of this boy, it may have been deleted.
   </p>
   <p>
    Is this $1000 show she refers to something related to fucked up things they make these children do as "entertainment" for these disgusting people?
   </p>
   <p>
    3:35 - "You will be helping Heavy Breathing get our products directly to you. Uncut, pure, and without the bad touch of the middle man. It will allow us to order the necessary amount of vinyl so all copies will find their way into the listeners hands". This obviously has nothing to do with "music" or her "band".
   </p>
   <p>
    3:57 - "Don't be shy. Let's fill those HOLES with sound and record orders. Come, let Heavy Breathing adopt your malnourished ears this 2015." Look for the big ear in the baby crib right after she says ADOPT YOUR MALNOURISHED EARS. What the fuck do you think this means?  Is she alluding to adopting children from orphanages for the use of sex?
   </p>
   <p>
    Now, I don't cover and analyze everything in the video but these are the major points that stood out to me. It's fucking blatantly obvious what's happening here. We need to dig deeper into Heavy Breathing "music" and the people who have links to it. Could these people be the suppliers of the children? We are not only looking for the people who are using children for sex, but also the people who are supplying them to the criminals. We all need to look deeper into Heavy Breathing.
   </p>
   <p>
    Additionally, check this video:
   </p>
   <p>
    Comet Pizza Ping Pong MajesticApe celebrates Birthdays 1.20.12.wmv
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDAybzlZqqY
   </p>
   <p>
    Notice the date? January 20th, 2012. This was inauguration day for the 2012 President Elect Obama!!!!!! (Who also has glaring links to Comet Ping Pong). The video apparently is also celebrating the birthday of person of interest, "Sasha Lord". Can anyone confirm her birthday is actually on January 20th? Either way, it's fucking weird.
   </p>
   <p>
    0:53 - "Welcome friendly people to Comet Pizza and Ping Pong. It's a a wonderful day, especially in January. It is the day of the birth of our lord. Sasha Lord. Sasha you're here. And we've all come together to celebrate the birth of our lord. It wasn't Christmas, no it's today. If you are like me, you love Sasha. Or if you don't, you want perks from her (creepy laughing). Things like free pizza (someone in the audience screems "WOO!"), or booze, or chapstick."
   </p>
   <p>
    Does Sasha Lord own a pizza restaurant? Thought she was just a talent producer or something related. Why would she be able to give free "pizza"? Why would people who "don't love her" still want to get perks from her? Sasha Lord must be linked to the supply of children for sex somehow.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm not going to analyze this entire video here right now because I have to get back to work. Need everyone to look deep into these videos as well as the other videos by Heavy Breathing www.heavybreathing.net to see if you guys can find any clues or leads. We have a lot of blatantly obvious circumstantial evidence but we need something SOLID on all of these people - the suppliers and the buyers. If you find any clues or suspicious things in the videos relating to Heavy Breathing leave them here.
   </p>
   <p>
    Also, since threads are being deleted please try to archive EVERY. FUCKING. THING. We can not lose any evidence.

    If you scroll to the bottom of the comments to the guy called Paul Edwards saying its the "best video ever", his profile picture is him surrounded by young black boys. Found it a bid odd.

      Not at all. They aren't very creative when choosing names and the names most likely are used to ID their position in the ring. Rachel Chandler, e.g. C. Handler...Child Handler. She also used Rachel loosely as I recall her IG display name was simply Ray Chandler.

      I noticed that from day one of talking to her. All of her fans really are pedos. One of them ask me I know someone with a name that's 1 letter off from mine and in the same city. The awkward thing is that he lives in the same apartments I lived in about 2 years ago. It's totally creepy and makes me feel threatened. We need to figure out a way to make sure we all stay safe . And resovle to avenge any deaths if they start killing to hide the truth

      All those names are suspect. Jeff's ch(ild) mid. Mid age maybe? Code for their age preference maybe. If the scale for children is 1 - 18, mid would be 9, 10, and 11.
     </p>
     <p>
      Erick Jackson... Jack sons. Jack off boys.
     </p>
     <p>
      Amanda Kleineman. 2 times "man" appears. Kleineman sounds like "kind of a man".

    Not sure if this has already been pointed out or not. That pic is on their facebook page. All of their other pictures are of gigs, flyers for concerts, etc... This one seems to be very out of place. I'm not saying this is damning evidence of anything. But it is certainly an odd picture unlike any others they have posted.
   </p>
   <p>
    edit: also wanted to add that there is no description or comments/likes, under an album titled "Looky Looky". Strange

     Does anyone else think that looks like Lady Gaga under the mask around the 23 second mark??

      You're right. It does look like her! And the character under the mask in this video looks a bit different from the character in the other videos.

    Sasha Lord is the concert booker for comet ping pong. I would assume she can give you free pizza because she works at the pizza place.

    searching around about amanda kleinman aka "majestic ape" on myspace, linked, etc., it looks like she has a totally normal freelance photography business, she mentors college kids and has relatively normal artsy type friends. And she looks healthy and well-adjusted. So, as bizarre and disturbing and heavy-handed as her Heavy Breathing videos are, I find it hard to believe that she is actively involved in the criminal stuff. Could she be a pawn without knowing it? Like paid to write songs with certain lyrics giving coded messages to the insiders? Or could she have been made an "offer she couldn't refuse" and gotten corrupted some time ago? Or, could she just be a genuine but weird artist that produces shock value that the true pedos enjoy legally (in addition to all their illegal stuff)?
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm not saying this to discredit any claims, as I've found the stuff so far thoroughly convincing, I'm just throwing it out there for objectivity.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm still curious about the honey pot theory too. It's also possible that there is a corrupt honey pot going on, where certain "informants" do their thing as long as they keep giving leads. Who knows...

     Or maybe she's too careful. I believe she's in that creepy birthday speech that's being shared as well. But you're right. She seems like a normal person I'd probably hang out with in day to day life. Her friends also seem to be normal, or at least more normal than the owner of the restaurant.

     I think it's good to be objective. There is always the possibility that we are reading into it and making false assumptions. Without hard evidence we can't really be sure, but the circumstantial evidence can't be denied.
    </p>
    <p>
     After all, until the world saw the email about spirit cooking and prompted us to investigate further into everything, wouldn't we have all thought the Podestas are just regular people working in politics? It's incredibly hard to judge the true nature of people without hard evidence. But judging by the content created by her group, it's impossible to say that she's completely innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Check the first song on page 6 of their website. http://heavybreathing.net/a.html
    </p>
    <p>
     It's obvious that airplane is supposed to look like a dick going into that little boy's mouth, and to the far left there is an adult holding a heart sign. Let's say "best case scenario" she just has a sick mind and likes to create shock value art purely for fun (although I could never consider this disgusting filth "art") involving children. We still need explanations for all the other connections - why is this group the first "friend" listed on a "family friendly" pizza joint's website? There's nothing family friendly about this. Things just don't add up. But I do think you made some very valid points surrounding the circumstances of her content and possible reasons for why this content would exist.

    Another interesting find - Seems like Amanda Kleinman of Heavy Breathing is trying to hide her Facebook page, but thanks to the FB archives I was able to find it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here is the link.
https://www.facebook.com/kleiny41
   </p>
   <p>
    Notice she changed the name to Dusty Springfield.
   </p>
   <p>
    However if you do a search for Amanda Kleinman on Facebook, you can find some of her old posts and tags.
   </p>
   <p>
    So why does she feel the need to hide her page if she's just an innocent, eccentric "artist"... suspicious.

    That dark comet ping pong video does not sound like a woman. Sounds more like an overly effeminate man. Not sure if there was just a vocal filter on the mic, but I don't think this is a woman. Amanda Kleineman... Remember Bart Simpson and his prank calls? Amanda = a man to
   </p>
   <p>
    Kleineman could be similar. Maybe "kind of a man".
   </p>
   <p>
    We should find pictures of this person, majestic ape, with other people and use the process of elimination. Whoever we never see with her, assume that's who she really is and see if it fits. Brock? Alefantis? A podesta? Epstein maybe?

     Yeah it seemed more like the flamboyant gay stereotype. But didn't it seem like there was a voice alteration of some sort?

      Yes, but it was subtle. I think there's even a line where they say something about doing voices, so it's hard to see. Would need some nice video editing software to check for pedals or see if there's any equipment in frame. I can see a cord on the mic at least.
