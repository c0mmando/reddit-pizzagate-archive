        <p><p>I also check Steve Quayle every day, glad he picked this up...the cover-up of giant skeleton existence is my favorite tin-foil hat pursuit, and he is all over that one.   He is kinda fear-porny at times, but I like him.  My buddies and I joke that if you subscribe to every conspiracy theory you will eventually be able to say "I told you 10 years ago!"  </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, I agree about Steve Q. He's really into the giants, nephilim and all that. I find it very interesting! He and LA Marzulli kind of rule that niche. He definitely does get fear-porny at times (So does Dave Hodges, another one of his allies). But I love Steve's spirit! You just know he was a nasty old bad boy back in the day! LOL!</p></p>
