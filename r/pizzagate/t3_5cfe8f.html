        <strong>Clintons Enacted Law in 1997 to create Forced Adoptions/Foster Care Industry/Pedophile Ring</strong>
        <p><p>I want to help, but don't know where to jump in.  I am familiar with abuse in the foster care industry and the part the Clintons have played in legalizing forced adoptions.  How can I best share this info?</p></p>

        <p><p>The name of the Act that Bill Clinton signed into law in 1997 (and Hillary worked to push through Congress) is the Adoption and Safe Families Act that legalized forced adoptions.  What is meant by "forced adoptions" is that the government now has control to force the termination of parental rights on a family even when they want to keep their children.  The act also monetarily incentivized states to push for these adoptions because they would get a paycheck from the Federal Government (out of the social security act) for the adoptions.  Children are literally being taken out of their mother's arms at hospitals to further this child mill.  You can learn more about it at medicalkidnap.com  Please let me know how I can further help to shine light on this part of the mystery.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm really interested in this law now, and after visiting that website, some of the things FBI anon said make sense. There was a lot of talk about the Bastardization of America in that thread, and this would be a powerful tool in achieving that goal. </p></p>
