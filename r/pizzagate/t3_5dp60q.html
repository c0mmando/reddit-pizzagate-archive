        <p><p>That's a CARDBOARD CUTOUT. Look at his waist - there's literally a line from the cardboard being bent. They're mocking him. Not to mention the lighting is all off on just him and he's considerably smaller than the other guy. The other guy also appears to be tripping him or something. Whatever he's doing, it doesn't seem respectful to the Pope. </p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="http://www.terapeak.com/worth/pope-francis-sitting-catholic-lifesize-cardboard-cutout-standee-standup-poster/121742101603/">Proof.</a></p>
<p>And might I add, this was not the cardboard cutout that was available free when the Pope visited the US. This sicko actually paid money to get a cutout of the Pope just to make fun of him at parties.</p></p>

        <p><p>Ha, I thought something looked weird about it.  Like out of focus or something.</p></p>
