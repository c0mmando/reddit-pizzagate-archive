    Okay; so I just typed in some of the people i had been tweeting to with the tag #pizzagate I used, and its now only showing my posts/posts from yesterday.. nothing fresh from today.. wtf
   </p>
   <p>
    Infact most of my tweets have stopped getting any attention, all about 16 hous ago - prior to this it was getting likes and RTs.. strange.
