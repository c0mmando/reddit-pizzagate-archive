        <strong>More FOOD CODE to keep eye out for - "MAYO" "TripleMayo" or "Doublemayo"</strong>
        <p><p>photo in question:  http://archive.is/Y2y7f</p>
<p>so why does a boring picture of a fence lead jimmycomet to say "This make me wish there was such a thing as #triplemayo" what is this?? a reference to a threesome?</p>
<p>https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/triplemayo/</p>
<p>a purse, shoes, and a watch?</p>
<p>another photo from same IG account is of 2 people embracing which they tag: "#DoubleMayo"   http://archive.is/00Pgf</p>
<p>be on the lookout for the word MAYO </p></p>

        <p><p>Okay I dug on this and here's what I seemed to find.
Doublemayo seems to reference fucking chicken sandwiches.<br>
Chicken as we know is a reference for underage kids in pedo speak.</p>

        <p><p>The purse, shoes and watch post is in Spanish, where "mayo" just means "May" (the month). It seems to be a contest where you could win a purse, shoes and a watch. Don't know about the other mayo references, though.</p></p>
