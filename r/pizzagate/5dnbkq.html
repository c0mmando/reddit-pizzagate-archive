    So most of us here are aware of the pedophilia satanic cult ring/child sex slave trafficking that the government is a part of. Yeah sure there are some new to this subreddit that are just learning about all this. However, let's be real, the GENERAL PUBLIC is still absolutely clueless about pizzagate and the breakthrough of this story...
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm talking millions upon millions of people (in the U.S) are still unaware. Wouldn't an effective way to get this story out to the public would be to create large pizzagate/pedogate posters (similar to the HRC spirit cooking posters) and just post them all over large cities. People will see them and begin to wonder, wtf is that? It will catch people's attention, which is what we need and from there maybe they will do some research. This information needs to be spread out across on a large scale.
   </p>
   <p>
    It's time for this information to stop being confined to this subreddit. The general public needs to be made aware of all this. I'm sure the Spirit Cooking posters posted across LA had some sort of effect on the Clinton campaign cause let's be real, that is some really wicked and taboo information that was fortunately leaked to the public by Wikileaks. I'm sure THEY hated that...
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm posting this because I personally do not have the resources to make such posters but anyone know who made the Spirit Cooking posters? Maybe they can help with pizzagate/pedogate posters. I wish you all the best and let's get this information out there!! (HRC spirit cooking link posted below)

    Do we? Or do we need to play it a little closer as a case is built? A lot of shit has gone private or been wiped because people have been overly zealous.

    I think the whole satanic thing won't garner the attention of many people. It comes off as an over-the-top conspiracy concept. If there were going to be posters, they need to make the point of children being involved and harmed in this terrible crime. That's the real problem with the pizzagate scandal.
