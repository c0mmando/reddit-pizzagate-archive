    This would help everyone because newcomers will have one big resource to maybe get them questioning a bit more. And folks who already believe in this will have a pool of links to use as evidence when they defend why this is called "pizzagate", and why this isn't just food being taken out of context(a common counter-argument).

    The most popular one I know is
    <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795">
     this email
    </a>
    talking about the handkerchief. Full quote:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want. I know you're busy, so feel free not to respond if it's not yours or you don't want it.
    </p>
   </blockquote>

    But I know there must be others and I'm hoping you guys can link to them? I've seen people argue that one email had Obama flying in $65k worth of pizza and hotdogs... but without a link to that email it's just gossip and speculation.

    I'm far from an expert in this and I'd imagine most of you on this sub have been researching much harder and more in-depth than I have. So if you do remember any specific emails that mention the pizza, pasta, hotdogs, etc please link to them so we can use this post as a resource.

    The weird coded emails started everything and they are the first piece of evidence that anyone should see. Just trying to figure out which specific emails are the most curious or point towards this whole thing being about more than just pizza &amp; dogs.
