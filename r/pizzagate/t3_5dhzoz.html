        <strong>We need a private, screened subreddit.</strong>
        <p><p>This sub is and will continue being a tremendous assist but we need someone to take charge and form a private team. We are breaking evidence in real time here and you're daft to think the other side isn't watching preparing countermeasures. </p>
<p>We need to handle sensitive data very carefully. The exposure of one lead can cause the collapse of the next if it's not kept quite. </p>
<p>I know a goal we're all working towards is transparency but we need to take note of Wikileaks. We need sticked "press releases" at a recurring rate, maybe 2 or 4 a month. </p>
<p>This will help stop the spread of disinformation as well. </p>
<p>Let's get task group together. We know this community has skills and connections invaluable to the investigation. If you're a student of your university, use the library, ask professors, research students, look for black hats in the IT community, anything that we don't have access to yet. </p>
<p>WE NEED TO USE OUR RESOURCES. </p>
<p>I'm in the process of using my library to research very old news articles, ones that cannot be accessed to the general public or have a pay wall. I'm a global health and epidemiology student and using the resources my professors have to get hard data about kidnappings, human trafficking, and possibly convictions. </p>
<p>Call your local university journalism program, find someone that will listen to you about pizzagate. Go to your local newsroom and bring PRINTED and USB data and present the evidence, they may even pay you for the story. </p>
<p>What they will not do is report you to any authority. These are professionals that worked to get where they are and we are fighting the greatest evil on Earth. They're good people and they will help you. </p></p>

        <p><p>Non-public organized groups have been formed. They are a work in progress at this time. Our continued use of Reddit as a public platform is definitely in jeopardy due to shitposters ignoring the rules-- whether out of ignorance or malice is a matter of debate. </p></p>

        <p><p>I would love to be invited to contribute. Is this a non-Reddit account? Between Reddit &amp; 4chan being hit so hard on this, everyone is just doing their own research, probably lots of overlap. Not very effecient. We need to get organized on the research and sharing end. It needs to be private so they can't keep abreast our progress. And it needs to be secure. Every subreddit touching this is compromised quickly. 4chan has been on and off. 8 is okay but not for everyone and too public. Let me know how you are proceeding please. </p></p>
