        <p><p>This whole sub is a mess most threads are just the same shit over and over with shit tons of weird links no one wants to fuckin click. Theres no stickies that have updated evidence / progression / covering all these different angles people seem to be posting like illuminati organ trafficking/satanism/pedo rings etc no one knows now they linked another pedo Clement Freud who had a villa in portugal to Podesta. Theres no organization at all</p></p>

        <p><p>I've been aware of the Clement ties for a bit now. The McCann thing is pretty criticised for being a distraction though.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't necessarily disagree that it is. Just pointing out that i've noticed it's often sited as a distraction. I wish there was something more concrete to go with and i think there's no reason to not search for that, but i hope it brings some results or else it might be a dead end lead even if its true.</p></p>

        <p><p>Right now at this point and time, so many things are coming together. So many other things <em>are</em> coming together that this is just a little piece. What you say is true - we don't know for sure. There's just a bigger picture that so many are trying to see more objectively. </p></p>

        <p><p>I think people are going to find that leads keep snowballing and the big picture is really much, much bigger than most imagine. I hope in the end it can all be put into one, nice, tidy, irrefutable presentation of devastating evidence.</p></p>

        <p><p>Think you're right. I have said the same thing myself. "Bad publicity is better than no publicity" is a terrible thing to put on this whole scandal. We <em>know</em> something is afoot though. In 2006 the Pentagon had an investigation tied to thousands of cases of cp being downloaded - this fact is irrefutable. That investigation was also closed down after 8 months with a whole lot of questions left unanswered. If all these "codes" are wrong , at least it is promoting awareness. Some things need to change. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, all these emails, added onto that investigation alone point to substance. </p>
<p>Things are snowballing like you say - and I feel as though it's going to be too big for us to even comprehend.</p></p>

        <p><p>Just wait until the ties start connecting to British Royalty, the Vatican and the UN. In the end, it's going to have to be a world wide revolt against the PTB, but it's worth the fight against this Goliath.</p></p>

        <p><p>I read some things that fit the bill on British Royalty yesterday - but it's one of those things we kind of have to wait for. Same with the UN - and I'm sure there are ties there too. </p>
<p>I am an ex Jehovah's Witness , and I'm waiting to see if there are ties from perhaps the founding of the religion , as many point to there being ties to Freemasonry. I read some things today with regards Mormons as well, and that will be interesting as people "investigate" this as well. </p>
<p>The Vatican. When all of this broke and continues to gain momentum, I can't help but think people are going to be scared and church attendance is going to go up. Satanism at the heart of this is enough for the average religious person to reflect on old sermons and get back to the pulpit discourses. </p>
<p>If and when religion gets dragged into this - it's going to get ugly beyond comprehension. </p></p>

        <p><p>I meant that in a "cheering you on" tone, not criticizing you.. I apologize for the misunderstanding.</p>
<p>But I think we can put the James alefantis = James loves infants thing to rest without even looking at the context of the post.. And I see that one of those are up right now.</p></p>
