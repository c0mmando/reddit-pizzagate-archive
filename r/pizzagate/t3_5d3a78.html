<strong>Reddit starting to permanently suspend Pizzagate related accounts</strong>
<p><p>I had 2 accounts I've been using to post evidence for about a week now. One was suspended early this morning, the other was just suspended 20 minutes ago. Anyone else had their accounts permanently suspended recently?</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> A few of you are asking to see proof. Here are screenshots of my two accounts. On one of the accounts I wrote a message to say that I had done nothing wrong, and you can see their reply here:</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/ejAP1C.png</p>
<p>And here is proof of where my other account was suspended too (about 10 or so hours after the first one was suspended)</p>

<p><p>It's true, our world's run by a cult of probably 70,000 child molesters. /u/spez being one of them, they're in full crisis mode. All of the forbes billionaires are in on it, most of academia, most of the media, and most judges. I think it's too late though, critical mass of awareness has probably already been reached. Time has come to reappropriate our prisons and fill them up with these sickos. </p></p>

<p><p>Possibly, I'm honestly completely unsure what Trump's intentions are, should of said most Forbes billionaires. The way it works is a lot of the billionaires are "created" with Tavistock's manipulation of wealth. They put pedophiles at the helms of all the power structures because 1) they're the easiest people to manipulate, 2) they'll do anything because you have blackmail. </p></p>

<p><p>lol think about how logically complicated and complex this plan would have to be to actually work. </p>
<p>think how much evidence &amp; proof would be accumulated by actually enacting such a massive, complicated complex plan</p>
<p>now realise that none of said evidence exists so how is it possible for you to be correct? </p>
<p>If you can't answer this simple question without calling me, a neutral skeptic, some kind of shill or whatever the go-to insult on this sub is, then you may be beyond reason. </p></p>

<p><p>I'm not sure how it all worked but the plan's been going on since the "beginning" of time. Our education is geared towards teaching us the false concept of "linear time" to maintain their shroud of secrecy. It goes pretty deep, everything we've ever been taught is wrong so it's going to be hard to figure out how they've really pulled this off. </p></p>

</p>
<p><p>so.... if it's been going on since the beginning of time, how comes there is <strong>no actual proof whatsoever from any period of history</strong>? </p>
<p>If the concept of time being linear is false (it's not) then how come our experience of time only moves forwards, and we can't time travel at will? </p>
<p>Whatever this "plan" is - think about it logically for a minute, how would you actually apply it to the world without someone just being like "hey look what this guy is doing" and ruining the entire plan straight away because if like you say, everything we know is wrong, there would be proof of that everywhere.... </p></p>

<p><p>They created history for the sole purpose of us looking at it to see if something is possible. Then they try to rewrite history and call it the "Mandala" effect which is a made up CIA term to try to get us to believe Google over our own past collective experiences. It's gonna be hard to unwrap our minds from this web of thoughts, our languages we're created with the sole purpose of trapping our minds into a state of polarity where everything only has two choices. Then they create a web of fake created thoughts that depend on each other but never actually make sense and you never reach the end of because of the polarity based thinking. </p>
<p>Anyways it's gonna be hard to make sense of until the we start connecting the different regions of our brain kept separated for so long.</p></p>

<p><p>But they can't have just created history because so much of it is independantly confirmable. So much stuff any person could just find a piece of and touch and see for themselves and that would reveal everything is fake and the entire thing would come crashing down. </p>
<p>If history is fake how come people digging in random countries keep finding new stuff that proves the rest of it is true? </p>
<p>If the mandala effect is true, then how is it possible that there's no such thing as an actual copy of the berenstein bears book? How comes every single real, physically existing copy says berenstain? How could that be faked, when people found mint-condition still wrapped from first press in 1962? which is recent enough that people would be alive to tell you if something was fake or not, so obviously it isnt? </p>

<p>You're joking right? different bits of the brain are seperate from other bits because they have different functions. If you somehow "bridged" the left and right hemispheres of a person's brain, you wouldn't create a superhuman, you'd have made some poor cunt a vegetable. </p>
<p>Im all for conspiracy theories but when they're just straight up balls-out-insanity that can't possibly be true, like this one, i'm a skeptic. </p></p>

<p><p>I bet you think mirrors aren't spying on us too, we've been living in the Truman show. They've had Tesla's free energy from the 60's and Berenstein's been a test this whole time. George Soros is Sid Bernstein who's behind all of this. </p>

<p><p>Not really, most of it is from personal experience. I'd google circular time and simultaneous time, and maybe watch some youtube videos about how we perceive time. Found an old note in my phone today saying "direct cognition avoids linear thinking". No idea when I wrote this lol, but I'd also check out direct cognition as a way to interact with the world rather than thinking about everything before doing it.</p></p>

<p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Not really that complicated at all. What you are imagining is complete control, or what they have taught you about fascist rulers in other countries but its really much easier and much more subtle.</p>
<p>Say company A (for example, chipoltle) doesnt submit. What do you do? Could you do anything to harm their reputation? </p>
<p>Say company B (for example, reddit) has a purpose that could be useful. It doesnt take much to manipulate things so that it shows up more in searches, acts faster, does better economically. Then you try to get them compromised in a subtle manner, say new rich guy is a cool new party with a new scene and hes all like yea this is awesome, and in a really drunk and fucked up state somebody asks him if he wants to fuck some underage girls cause he knows a place. He says no, w.e. forget about it, I think he will hardly do anything about it. He says yes, one more for the books.</p>
<p>Say company C (for example, ATT) has already been long compromised, how would they look like? Would they be doing illegal stuff for the government? Would they have special programs to work for the government and their aims besides what the consumer wants? Would they be massively successful?</p>
<p>They have taught you to look at things wrong from the start. </p></p>

<p>I didnt say that, im not the other guy. I'm just saying, and im assuming an American education here, that you had the same experience I had. They taught us very specific examples of how the USSR or Nazi Germany would try to control the people. Thats not what they are doing, they do things differently. The government uses companies as fronts because thats how you do things in America, capitalism style. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_organization) This is well documented and well known. </p>
<p>Also well documented about how they tried to manipulate culture in the past, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird.</p>
<p>Its also well documented that they have programs meant to break up social movements from the start, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO.</p>
<p>There is also plenty of well documented proof of pedophilia related cases not going according to plan, who could possibly cause this to happen? https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/</p>
<p>The thing is, this is all hidden under the ideology of 'freedom' that is pushed onto Americans. So the way you think is this, : "I can write anything online, I can vote for anything, I can advocate for anything and nothing will happen to me, therefore this is a perfectly safe and free country". But you know its not completely true. While they push tons of stories of journalistic oppression in Iran and Russia, the same thing happens in the US, what the hell do you call Snowden, Manning, etc?</p></p>

<p><p>If this were actually happening, then how come I can go and watch that documentary? Wouldn't the writers have been killed before it was done? Wouldn't it be removed? Wouldn't you be killed before you could spread the info?
The same thing exist with this conspiracy, if it is so widespread then it only takes literally one person to trip it up. You'd need one bit of solid evidence and then just release it. Then it's all over.</p></p>

<p><p>All I know is that they completely influence all politicians, public servants, military officers, business leaders and everything else, from the age of 18-22. Younger if you consider secondary education.</p>
<p>They are far more powerful than anything else. What they believe to be true, the rest of society thinks. It seems to me like you're unaware of the Frankfurt school? The Cathedral?</p></p>

<p><p>Science and tech etc is just a sideshow in the university system now. They keep a little real learning happening just to prevent us from going back into the stone age. Otherwise it's largely an indoctrination program. That used to be a learning program.</p>
<p>I noticed you avoided talking about Frankfurt school.</p>
<p>Btw "part of this conspiracy" - I'm not claiming anything until there is evidence. I have no evidence that academia is involved in pizzagate. You had replied to a comment which was talking about who's really in charge, and you simply said that academics have zero influence. I think the opposite is true.</p></p>

<p><p>I think the CIA promotes and pushes certain ideologies in Academia, like how psychology is vastly different in the US than in most other countries, for example. But I think near 100% of the people involved in the profession of psychology do so with pure intentions and continue to do so under the ideals of helping people. There might be a handful of people aware of this shit and thats it, most just follow good intentions. The academic world is rigid, its not THAT hard to mold it, you just have to twist the standards of publication, etc, and the researchers follow. </p>
<p>I have no idea about the Frankfurt school, but you are talking about something completely different.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah sorry to hijack your comment, but this is important.</p>
<p>I have friendlies at Reddit on all of their teams, and I haven't heard a whisper about this. There were tons of conspiracies on r/The_Donald about this over the course of the election, but time after time, the accounts were banned for abuse or other community violations (like vote manipulation, rampant rule breaking, etc.). </p>
<p>Edit: you can downvote me if you'd like, but this is true. </p></p>

<p><p>They're close friends who I've talked to about this. Some of them think this is another cute conspiratard blowup and others thing there are strange things at work.</p>
<p>None of them has said anything about removing people or banning around Pizzagate. </p>
<p>I'm not saying it's impossible, but the burden of proof is on the one making the claim. I don't see any actual evidence presented in this thread. </p></p>

<p><p>It is censorship. Since when did it become wrong to link to a Facebook page that is made publicly available? This implies it was also "against the rules" for everyone who ever linked to James Alefantis's social media, Comet Ping Pong social media, Marina Abramovic's social media, Heavy Breathing's social media, and anyone else who's social media pages have ever been linked to on reddit regarding the scandal. The FB link in question was to Tony Podesta's FB, and I never made any accusations against him in that post. I simply posted it for everyone to take a look. In fact, I even made it a point in my post to remind people NOT to contact or harass anyone. Additionally, they banned my other account too. So either they are starting to step it up with the censorship, or they've singled me out. Which one seems more plausible? Further, what will they start to say is "against the rules" next?</p>
<p>According to their response, they are implying that it is against the rules to speculate about the international pedo ring that is happening in our world and to speak about those who may be involved based on the substantial circumstantial evidence we've found. Therefore, this entire subreddit must be "against the rules"...</p></p>

<p>Since you were explicitly accusing that specific person of having committed some of the most atrocious crimes known to humanity and you have <strong>literally no actual proof whatsoever</strong>.  </p>
<p>it is not censorship to say "no doxing" then ban you for doxing someone. Read the rules of the site, you agreed to not dox when you signed up. </p></p>

<p><p>Yeah you did, you linked a guys <strong>personal</strong> facebook in a conversation about "satanic ritual pedophile abuse murderers and child trafficking" </p>
<p>that's near literally the definition of accusing someone of something. </p>
<p>Linking someone's personal facebook, is doxing. facebook may be a public website, facebook profiles may be "public" - but a person's personal facebook is not that. Look it up. </p></p>

<p><p>Out of curiosity, I've seen many post to James Alefantis' instagram. Is there any difference between his insta and another person's facebook? </p></p>

<p><p>not a clue, but obviously since it's the explicit reason given for his banning, sharing people's personal facebook accounts is considered breaching privacy, ask a reddit admin not me. </p></p>

<p><p>Oh yeah, you want people to link your facebook and connect your real life persona to pedophilia? No you don't. That's why this rule exists. Don't like it? Leave reddit.</p></p>

<p><p>Yea, they've been shadow banning people left and right. I had to make a new account because my posts weren't showing up either.</p></p>

<p><p>Are they making it so only submissions are shadow banned but not comments?</p></p>

<p><p>Not sure. I didn't try commenting, as soon as I realized my posts weren't showing up I made a new account. I can see your comments though so if you are in fact shadowbanned, your comments are still visible right now</p></p>

<p><p>Calm down people. Reddit always stated this is against their rules, pretty much all of this is. That they keep the sub running already shows their good intention. Posting personal details was always pruned with bans, how should this be different this time?</p></p>
