    This all needs organization. That is the single biggest problem.
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    There are links scattered everywhere, a bunch of different people researching the same stuff and sharing the same conclusions in different areas.  It's fragmented, and it's inefficient.
   </p>
   <p>
    If this were an organized effort, with people able to quickly see the connections, and for people to continually backup the progress of it OFFLINE.. we'd be on to something.
   </p>
   <p>
    Does anyone have a tool or website that we can use to do this? A wikipedia of sorts that can be moderated?  Wouldn't that help immensely?

    Currently there is
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cj3oo/11122016_update_please_see_subreddit_rules/">
     a summary post on this sub
    </a>
    which has been recently updated. There are summaries in other subs as well, for instance
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5b1qtf/comet_ping_pong_pizzagate_summary/">
     this nice looking one
    </a>
    by /u/DumbScribblyUnctious. Both of those are in archive.is. Not sure about anyone else, but I like to download after I archive. For example the summary post on this sub can be downloaded here: http://archive.is/download/4K491.zip
   </p>
   <p>
    But I'd agree, more organization is needed. Many of these ideas are still being fleshed out and that's where it'll always be a bit messy. But there are some ideas which are unlikely to change and those seem fitting for a wiki of some sort. It'll happen!

     I just want to note to everyone to be vigilant about possible disinformation.  It's one of the main tactics they will employ to stop this information from spreading.  Investigate all possible leads, but only spread clear-cut evidence that is directly verifiable.  No hearsay.  No wild speculation.

      Agreed 100%. Yet when posts are removed for not containing enough info, the sky is falling and the government is censoring. We have to operate within some type of parameters or we will be discredited. Then it's all for nothing.

      Great comment. Please continue to help.

     I have everything backed up and I make sure to pastebin the whole thing whenever I make an edit. What I need to do next is collate all the files into a single archive, though it looks like it makes more sense to do that in the github someone else setup. I don't want to see a bunch of zip files being shared on here for file security reasons anyway.

    The summary doesn't include everything either.

    I have google doc set up and I have started listing leads. It is far from complete, but this could be a good form of documentation that plenty of people could add to over time. I don't want to post the link publicly, as it could be abused by CTR or trolls, but I am happy to share the link if you pm me.

     You need an offline back up that can't be written over by your Google doc during a sync.

    Second problem is who do you report it to? Maybe the British press that broke their child sex scandal?

     We need to gather as much circumstantial evidence as possible and as many people as possible need to send it to literally every media outlet.  You can't rely on one.  Problem is there's so much nonsense out there that things like this get lost in the noise

    Can someone create a Git where we can contribute? Preferably mirror it on GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab etc.  Or some type of wiki.  Or maybe a public FTP server.
