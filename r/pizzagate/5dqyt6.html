   <strong>
    Just a dumb grand scheme theory (no evidence of anything here)
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I just recently started using reddit about a month before the election, and it wasn't too long after watching the wikileaks rolling out that my mind was totally blown.  I haven't contributed much to the community unfortunately, but I have tried supporting the Don and Assange however I could through social media.  But ever since I've been red pilled, I have definitely been afflicted deeply and I now totally see the world differently.
   </p>
   <p>
    The first thing that really had me uneasy were all of the talks of WW3 and the possible impending doom of nuclear war if Clinton were to be elected (a lot of this sort of stemmed from the FBIAnon chats that were shared on here and that I read through, and were mildly corroborated from the wikileaks).  As a marijuana smoker/vaper/consumer, I was often quite high while reading a lot of this stuff, which very strongly magnified the emotional impact of many of these revelations/theories/realities.
   </p>
   <p>
    I found myself thinking a lot about / imagining death a lot more (not in a suicidal way, but more of a "trying to figure it out" sort of deal, to cope with the possibility of serving the country in a Civil/World war, or just an attack).  I used to be very religious (catholic); but that stopped many years ago.  I recently came to the conclusion (and I feel more confidently in this conclusion more so than I have ever felt about any religion or theory that I have ever heard) about what happens when you die.
   </p>
   <p>
    And it is that nothing happens.  Its the equivalent of the time between when you fall asleep and before you start dreaming- its just timeless. It is a period that you never remember or realize or particularly care about.  There is nothing to fear because there is just nothing; no thought, no emotion, no worry about "when will I wake up".  Its better than an afterlife because you are just free of all humanly binds.  If you aren't afraid to close your eyes and go to sleep at night, then there really isn't a reason to fear death.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now, why is this important?  Well- I'm noticing that all of these Pizzagate theories seem to revolve around religionS.  Multiple.  The whole catholic church sex scandal.  Then you have the Zionists, the Jesuits, Satanist blah blah blah blah blah blah.  But I feel like none of the religions are actually particularly important at all.  They're just a back story.
   </p>
   <p>
    Everybody is worshipping something, but they are all doing the same thing - totally disregarding all social/moral standards of decency that are constructed from rules that are basically staples of virtually every modern religion world wide, and more importantly, human conscience.
   </p>
   <p>
    Human conscience, in my mind, is rooted in fear.  Specifically, the fear of death, or rather, the fear of what happens when you die.
   </p>
   <p>
    If nothing happens when you die (in a fashion as i suggested above), then there is no consequence for your actions.  With no consequence, then there is nothing to fear.  And without fear, there is no need for conscience.
   </p>
   <p>
    If there is any truth to this pizzagate shit, then it is evident that these people have no conscience, and life (and everything that inhabits it) is just a sandbox to them.  To manipulate and dominate.
   </p>
   <p>
    The religion thing could be a front - like you are least likely to suspect a holy man to be the one committing a crime.  But this could be a "what came first, chicken or the egg" thing - do the people hide behind the religions, or do the religions hide behind the people?
   </p>
   <p>
    The ones claiming to be the most righteous are the ones most devoid of a soul.
   </p>
   <p>
    Did they figure out death somehow?
   </p>
   <p>
    If you figured out the truth to dying tonight, would you be a different person tomorrow?
   </p>
   <p>
    Just my crazy thought

    Good post. We all have to vent about our red-pill experiences, e.g. some cheesy movie about a vampire looking at the world in a new way. It is unquestionably Mr. Toad's Wild Ride...hang on!
