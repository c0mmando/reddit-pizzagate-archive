        <strong>How deep do you think this goes?</strong>
        <p><p>I know someone with connections to prominent people in state government, possibly federal as well. I'm debating if I should approach them about this. </p></p>

        <p><p>I worked for a prominent institute. I met more than half of the presidential candidates. I met over a dozen billionaires, over two dozen former heads of state. I met George Soros himself. I can tell you I never have met such a town full of nihilistic and narcissistic people. No enthusiasm no desire other than seeking power. There was a lot of people that had some wacky ideas. I found myself talking about satanism a number of times, I always chalked it up to folks being fascinated with contra-Christain ideas. I never really thought they were taking the ideas seriously. When I think about it they may have been testing me.</p></p>

        <p><p>Is your will in order? I'm not saying whether to approach or not, just saying to proceed with caution. If the person is low on the totem pole than they won't know anything, those that do know are either a part of it or will deny/hide it. If they knew and were a good person, they would have already come forward unless stopped by fear.</p></p>

        <p><p>They are not a politician, but that's a very good point . Seems like a good person but I don't know them at all outside of a certain setting. Too much risk involved. </p></p>

        <p><p>Well we know this has ties to some of the most powerful people in the world, so consider that but yeah, everyone needs to talk to someone at some point.. My opinion is the only way something will ever be done is public pressure</p></p>

        <p><p>I would say to ask them in private...ONCE.. Just say that you saw on Reddit about some pizzagate thing and ask him if he's heard about it and if there's any truth to it. You'll just seem like someone who saw it pop up and is curious rather than someone who is actually trying to help uncover it.</p></p>
