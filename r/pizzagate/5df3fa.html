   <strong>
    POSSIBLE BRANCH: Explaining Turkey Side
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    As you might have noticed, PizzaGate is a highly popular topic in Turkey right now. Below, there is a short summary explaining the reason.
   </p>
   <p>
    The last six months for Turkey was a hard period. There was a suspicious attempt to coup and so many kidnappings tied to one guy, Fethullah Gülen.
   </p>
   <p>
    He is a islamic leader (more like a cultist to be honest) and he is currently in Pennsylvania. His followers are absolutely fanatic and mad, when he talks they either pass out from excitement or cry their eyes out. Now it gets interesting from here
   </p>
   <p>
    1) Orphanage in Haiti
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/04/turkey-fethullah-gulen-cleric-opposition-erdogan-akp.html
   </p>
   <p>
    Gülen has many educational centers in African countries. He also has an orphanage and a hospital in Haiti. He supports those people if and only if they accept the radical islamism and its violent methods.
   </p>
   <p>
    2) Donations to Clinton Foundation
   </p>
   <p>
    http://dailycaller.com/2016/08/23/emails-show-ties-between-hillary-clinton-and-followers-of-controversial-turkish-cleric/
   </p>
   <p>
    There are numerous evidence pointing towards a connection between Hillary and the Fetullah Gülen. His organization have been donating large amounts of money towards to the Hillary Foundation.
   </p>
   <p>
    3)  Commercial Before the Coup
   </p>
   <p>
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTfija0ACPg
   </p>
   <p>
    Just exactly 9 months and 10 days before of the coup in Turkey, a newspaper called Zaman have released a commercial. In this commercial there is a baby laughing and the title of the commercial is "Cry of the Silence". (There are some rumors that saying the idea came from David Brock, but I couldn't find a source for it so I'm skipping that for now.)
   </p>
   <p>
    4) Ensar Foundation and the Child Abuse
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36071773
   </p>
   <p>
    Over 40 children have been abused and probably raped by the employees of this foundation. This foundation has a religious background and has ties with the current government. The interesting this is that the AKP tried to cover up this mess and swept it under the rug.
   </p>
   <p>
    5) Organized Kidnappings in Dorms
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/girls-dorm-residents-in-turkeys-zonguldak-protest-amid-harrassment-kidnapping-of-students.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=104827&amp;NewsCatID=341
   </p>
   <p>
    Possibly my best lead here. In Zonguldak city of Turkey, 2 women have been kidnapped in 3 days. The girls residing in the dorm finally did a protest and even then, nothing really happened. This one have been swept under the rug too.
   </p>
   <p>
    6) Hizmet (The Service)
   </p>
   <p>
    This is my personal experience here. I have studied for a while in one of the islamic schools, which belonged to the Fetullah Gülen at the time. They have a scheme called Hizmet. In this scheme there are 2 branches, either you support intellectual property and power to the Gülen Foundation or you do the dirty work. I was a successful student therefore they tried to talk me into supporting them when I get a position in government. Even though I have told them that I was going to be an engineer but they always insisted on governor-equivalent jobs (social and scientific studies have different exams and branches in Turkey).
   </p>
   <p>
    While pushing people for their agenda, they use Brothers (abiler) and Sisters (ablalar). Brothers and sisters brainwash small group of young people, by giving them a place to stay only if they read Gülens books and listen to his speeches.
   </p>
   <p>
    I assume that there are more than hundreds of solid evidence about this mad cleric but these are the ones that I remember. If you have any questions regarding to their cult, do not hesitate to ask.

   <p>
    In addition to this, I have seen non-Turkish people saying stuff like "Maybe Erdoğan is being blamed by the western media to cover for Gülen"
   </p>
   <p>
    While it's true that they are pushing the idea that Erdoğan staged a coup himself, Erdoğan is definitely not innocent. Him and Gülen were best buddies up until a few years ago. Erdoğan supported his every move and helped him at all costs. Which includes Gülen's men getting all sorts of goverment positions from top to the bottom. From low ranked police officers, to military officers and to MPs.

   <p>
    Sorry why exactly is this guy living in a mountain in Pennsylvania in the US despite being such a controversial figure?
   </p>
   <p>
    And why are so many shady people donating to the Clinton Foundation?

     CIA uses him to interfere with internal affairs of African and Asian countries. He has many schools or educational centers in many third-world countries. He lives in Pennsylvania and he is protected by US government.

        As soon as I wake up, up until I fall asleep at night I am thinking about this. Telling people about it. Researching. I've even had a nightmare/dream about it (probably from thinking about it so much). I hope we can bring justice soon, but I feel we have a long road ahead of us.

         I feel like it can take a lot of years for it to become public. Even if it does, I feel like only half will become public. It feels so surreal. I can't even tell anyone about it. How do you tell people about it? How do you start that conversation? I want to tell so many people about it but I'm scared to do so. I don't know where to start and I feel like they wouldn't take me seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
         You can PM me any time! I feel like you and I know a lot of other people feel the same in this sub.

          It's not hard to tell people.  But you have to start with bite sized chunks.  A trail of breadcrumbs that were covered in the mainstream media making it easy for people to latch on to:
         </p>
         <p>
          For example you can say "hey did you hear about that David Brock guy - head of Media Matters?  Yeah he was blackmailed by the owner of this Pizza joint for 850k.  I wonder what he's hiding!"  Then you can say - "yeah, and the owner of that pizza place posted all these really creepy instagram photos of kids and stuff - I think he's some kind of pedo".  Then you can say - "and you know what?  that Podesta guy?  Yeah Clinton's campaign guy that dude - there's a ton of emails in the wikileaks where he and his brother is in contact with this same pizza guy.  Have you seen Podesta's creepy art collection? ... what a weirdo.  In fact, this pizza guy was listed as one of washingtons most 50 influential people.  How does that happen?  Obama even had phone banks at that pizza place.  And look at the creepy bands they have playing there and all the creepy photos they put online.  Which by the way, his instagram has since been set to private!
         </p>
         <p>
          That should start the conversation...
         </p>
         <p>
          Edit:  Here's now NOT to start the conversation - "Hey did you hear about that stanic pedo cult involving a bunch of Washington officials and maybe even the Clinton foundation?"

         I dreamed about it last night too. Only, it was not a cohesive dream - just my mind looping in circles going over and over the info I've read, trying to put the puzzle pieces together.

    Everyone should look into "retired" high-ranking CIA officer Graham Fuller. He's most likely Gülen's chief handler in the US - I know he's the one who secured Gülen's visa to move here.
   </p>
   <p>
    Oh and btw, Graham Fuller's daughter is/was married to Ruslan "Uncle Rus" Tsarnaev - yes, the uncle of the Boston Bombers.

    I have looked up some Turkish tweets with the hashtag #PizzaGate and a lot of them are around the emotinonal blame structure that is "It is thought that the easterners are uncivilized but look at what westerners are doing!". So it looks to me the main reason for Turkish interest in this topic is based on trying to redirect their distaste of the unending crisis both within and around the county and just blame something, throw it out. I lived most of my life around tons of western propaganda regurgitated by the elite and anti-western propaganda regurgitated by the much more populous non-elite folk. In my opinion the attention on this matter is an emotional (and misplaced) attempt by people who want to to feel like they matter and feel like they can change something in the political scene.

    Nice article that shows a lot of possible leads. If it has connections in Turkey either that Gülen or AKP must have involved.
   </p>
   <p>
    Buy I think there should be some corrections to be made for the sake of clarity. First you said Gülen movement accepts radicals. I couldn't reckon a passage in the source related. Even they are seen too moderate by other groups. Second  that dorm kidnappings probably not related since victims are 'old' for the matters we are on. I would say that's about other sick local individuals.
Nevertheless it doesn't change the insanity of Gülenists and the possibility that pizzagate has some connections in Turkey too.

     Gülenists think that Gülen is some kind of "savior" (mehdi) similar to messiah. They are not ISIS-kind of radicals but they are not moderates too. They would do anything for Gülen.

    What are some good books to read on Turkish politics, intelligence and war from 1900-now, books on Erdogan n Gulen, if ya know of any? Also I remember wikileaks were going to release info relating to the recent coup, but they were cyber attacked, and then we heard nothing about it, what is ur view on that, and what dya think of possible US n specifically HRC, Kissinger and CIA involvement? What dya think about the subsequent thawing of Russo-Turkish relations in d aftermath? Cheers

     I believe Gulen has very strong ties with CIA and they use to have very strong ties with Erdogan as well. When Erdogan got elected he was a political figure but he wasnt established as Gulen. Both of them represent right wing and Erdogan used Gulen's trained followers to penetrate in all part of Turkish instutions. After the coup attempt i doubt that Turkish Government were ruling the country. Gulen's followers were gate keeping almost every part of the Turkish Government.
    </p>
    <p>
     I believe Gulen has became a project early 80's in Turkey. And the 1st mentioners about it's danger for Turkish Republic got killed. (Like Journalist Uğur Mumcu)  If coup attempt were successful maybe he would have come back to Turkey like Humeyni in Iranian revolution or maybe not.
    </p>
    <p>
     Russo-Turkish thawing issue;
All started with a downing Russian Jet over Syrian Border by Turkish army, but i believe Russians figured it out that wasn't Erdogan. Yes it was Turkish government but done by Gulen's mens. Putin is no stupid man. He knew about the coup attempt and a successful attempt could take Turkey down. Probably he did not want it.
    </p>
    <p>
     If we think about the happenings on 15th July, F16 flying low on Ankara and Helicopters gunning into Central Intelligence HQ, Erdogan wouldnt be alive w/o Putin's help. Probably Russian spec ops got Erdogan out of his hotel in Marmaris while Turkish Spec Ops (Gulen's) were going to assasinate him. And his plane couldnt make it to Istanbul Ataturk Airport if Russian jets were covering.
    </p>
    <p>
     Long story short; i'm no Erdogan lover. I believe he's really corrupted, but a successful coup would put Turkey in really bad situation. If we look down mesopotamia, i don't think US want Turkey as a gamer while trying to recreate the borders. Coup would have a good destabilizing effect on Turkey.
    </p>
    <p>
     Russian saw, think and acted in their own favor ofc.

       No i dont think so. Nothing has changed for the better since WW1 in these territories. First Brits revolted bedouins against Ottoman Empire and united them for their freedom now it might be easier to control a dissolved Arabia after 100 years and  King Abdullah's death. Everything would go as planned with Clinton secret agenda if she was elected. But now it will take some time for Donald to understand all the corrupted corelations.
      </p>
      <p>
       US wanted Kurds maybe Russians wants Armenians, or they already have a strong contract with Essad. You never know.
      </p>
      <p>
       They couldnt take Erdogan with coup maybe they will take him down economically. Turkish currency strongly depreciates against US Dollars nowadays.

         Well Kurdish situation is a bit different. Conflict goes back to late Ottoman Empire WW1 where Ottoman Empire was weak almost dissvolved and early Turkish Republic where something went terribly wrong, like "dersim massacre and the events before &amp; after" Dersim massacre was terribly bad handled by Turkish government and army officers in charge. I like Ataturk very much and his ideas on newly established Turkish Republic but that time imo  his sickness was heavy to make correct decisions and well handle the situation. (He died on 10th Nov 1938, Dersim happened in 1938,1939)
Ok, mistakes or bad situations can happen, what is important is the will of sorting your problems out. Well, it didn't happen after Ataturk all.
        </p>
        <p>
         And after the establishment of PKK with Abdullah Ocalan aspect of conflict started to change. To finance the armed movement imo armenians, cia, germans, russian, smuggling of drugs, petroleum etc. got in the picture and everything got messed up.
        </p>
        <p>
         So PKK and Kurdish citizens has to be evaluated differently. That's why i supported HDP (Selahattin Demirtas) on last 2 elections. He was talking about the peace, unification etc.
        </p>
        <p>
         HDP got 10% of the general votes (in total 9million votes şn Turkey) and got in the parliament. And while everything was getting better 2 or 3 major events happened. (This is where i believe dark hand comes in place imo)
1st Suruç explosion (ISIS Sunnis - Kurds Si'a) (over 39 Kurd died while reading peace notice on their way to Kobane)
2nd hit back with assasination of 3 police officers in their sleep in east of Turkey.
3rd Ankara explosion and everything got out of control.
        </p>
        <p>
         The bad part is that while everything getting out of control HDP - Selahattin Demirtas didn't stand against PKK to say something "ok we don't support PKK, we stand with Kurdish citizens and Turkey"  if he would say it most of the borrowed HDP voters will be standing with them. He was mentioning it before the elections during his campaigns.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the other hand, there is northern iraqi, syrian kurds like PYD, YPG, Peshmerge. I see ISIS as a project which got out of control, established after Al-Qaida dissolvement, to destabilize mesopotamia and recreate borders. Creating a free Kurdistan in Northern Iraq and Syria and even with east of Turkey. So coup was important in that aspect and  US Presidential elections too.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm a peace seeker, but it's not gonna happen for a while in that territories after destabilization of governments, institutions, etc.

    Personally, I feel that Tavistock created a few cults, like the Process Church of the Final Judgment, that were designed specifically to infiltrate other cults. The Process Church left England to go to California, where they co-opted a lot of the Scientologists, before going to Mexico to work with the Santa Muerta cults, before going to the Caribbean to engage the voodoo cults and ending up in New Orleans.
   </p>
   <p>
    The General Authorities of the Mormon church, per the Pace Memorandum, outline how 60 children were witness to the inside of the temple at night (kids are not normally allowed in) and child sacrifices were made on the altar under the west end of the temple. Since no kids are allowed in, it is certainly a puzzle that many could describe the inside, let alone an underground portion that even adults aren't allowed to go.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the cults and larger churches have been infiltrated by a Tavistock engineered cult, then why wouldn't the Muslim faith and the Wahhabists also have been infiltrated?
   </p>
   <p>
    Either way, go through the donors of every orphanage on DR/Haiti and see what they connect to.

    There were accusations about Erdogan for havig sexual relationship with minors in Iran. This was possibly a smear campaign made up by Gulenists. But after the blow of pizzagate I cannot be so sure.
