        <strong>WTF?! Post with 1000 votes vanished!</strong>
        <p><p>What is happening?  The post with 1000 votes that reached /r/all is completely gone.  I can't see it anywhere.</p>
<p>Did it get censored?
Are we compromised?
Did OP get killed/hacked?</p>
<p>This is serious people.  Mods can we get an answer?</p></p>

<p>Think for a second though, what if we're right? I'm no Trump supporter, but I think Hillary and her associates are involved in something insidious. We can't risk leaving this alone.</p></p>

        <p><p>This a million times. Pics or it didn't happen. We live in the world of reality, not some sockpuppet /u/warrioreers87 (btw if that is the username that the real Ibrahima Abe Diallo from Hope of Guinea picked, I'll eat my fucking hat! lol) claiming he is someone. We <em>need</em> proof. Otherwise this is just pure censorship!</p>
<p>Also, why on earth would he fear for his life? No one is going to go and beat up/kill a potential witness. He's obviously not the kingpin. How would we get to the real leaders like Podesta and Hillary and Soros and their handlers without remanding the lower operatives in custody?</p>
<p>If anyone is going to kill a lower level operative, it will be the perverts themselves in a false flag operation designed to clean up loose ends and discredit pizzagate.</p></p>

        <p><p><strong>No. He is innocent until proven guilty.</strong> </p>
<p>If you have a hard line to drag him into <em>pizzagate</em>, the onus is on you to prove he's one and the same person guilty of whatever you're accusing him of.</p>
<p>He's asking us to leave him and his friends alone. If you don't have proof, you need to leave the man and his friends alone because it is indeed harassment. reddit would shut pizzagate down: not because you hit a nerve with Podesta or Clinton, but because reddit doesn't condone witch-hunts with the reddit hivemind.</p></p>

        <p><p>Mr. Diallo: I believe you, and I am sorry this is happening to you friend.</p>
<p>Hopefully you understand that your name is more common in Guinea than the U.S., and you are right, it's discriminatory to assume they're all one and the same.  They might not like it, but I'll take this opportunity to apologize on reddit's behalf.</p>
<p>Would you mind taking a brief moment to enlighten us, so that we can avoid this kind of error in the future? Just how common is the name <em>Diallo</em> in Guinea? Eg. how many people do you know with this name who are not relatives of yours?</p>
<p>I've come across a number of Amadou and Mamadou Diallos, and understand both of these first names are a variation of Mohamed. Amadou Diallo is the same name as the NYPD shooting victim in February, 1999. So yes, I see there is a lot of room for mistakes, and I hope we can all avoid making them.</p>
<p>If you could please give us a ballpark in percents -- like what are the <em>odds</em> you and the other Diablos are related to the shooting victim?</p>
<p>Any information that helps us stay on the right track so we can avoid false accusations is greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p></p>

        <p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for understanding what is happening right now. The name Diallo is very very common in Guinea. There are a more than 2 million Diallo's in Guinea and I'm not related to probably over 98% of them. If you google Ibrahima Diallo, you will find so many of them. In discussing Amadou Diallo, the shooting victim we are not related at all. Diallo might be the same as saying Johnson in the States. Just a simple Google will reveal so many different Diallo's that is so completely false to make any correlations based on last name and first name as they are anything but unique.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></p>

        <p><p>Guys pizzathrowaway is on our side, gotta maintain a sense of rationality, I lost my sense too. Google is heavily in on this, be weary of all the search results, took me a while to realize that. As a mod if pizzathrowaway were to delete our posts, they still appear in our old posts as deleted. Whoever is doing the mass deleting is in charge of the server and simply deleting it as if it never existed at all. </p></p>

<p>And she's gone. Interesting account though. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vpCAjW7.jpg">Satanic poetry</a>, buys her bf a <a href="https://imgur.com/a/8rmcN">Russian Ovechkin jersey</a> (which is weird 'cause it's usually written in Western letters even for the national team) and this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once when I moved to a new place, there were two oblong packages in the freezer. I peeled back the wrapping and found two severed arms from two different elderly women (nails still painted). Turns out the previous resident worked in the medical industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice of her to come out of reddit retirement to comment on our highly important investigation! Hey /u/jholzi post up another (different) picture of your bf in the Ovechkin jersey. Or you're a shill.</p></p>

        <p><p>The severed arm story is a true story, strange things happen when you move into college towns.</p>
<p>As you can see the "Satanic" poetry is from when I was in the 4th grade, and reached the top of r/funny. It was something I found in my mom's basement, and I thought it was hilarious.</p>
<p>We are huge caps fans, and lots of times people will have Ovechkin jerseys custom ordered with Russian lettering. I thought it would be cool to have it done on the Russian national jersey. I had it custom made for him. Paid a lot of money for it too.</p>
<p>Can I be left alone now? Like I said, this morning I alerted my friend when I saw her personal information on the front page of reddit. I have never seen this subreddit and I still don't understand what it's all about. I deleted my comments because I don't want to be the next victim of a witch hunt. Especially since you all are quick to post personal information in connection with harmful statements and accusations.</p></p>

<p>Fair enough. There is a balance to be struck. Thanks for replying. However we're not going to stop. We are working to stop evil people who are engaging in harming children.</p>
<p>BTW deleting, running and hiding is always suspicious. Warriors of light never have anything to hide. I stand tall muscular and proud. I'd rather be found by the enemies of truth and fight for my life than cower and hide.</p>
<p>If I have anything to do with it, no innocent person will be harmed because of this or the FBI investigation. Remember we have no motivation to hurt a low-level pedo. Much better to get them alive for questioning, so we can get the real perps.</p></p>

        <p><p>This post was removed because I received these messages:</p>
<p>1) Hi, I'm messaging you concerning the hope of Guinea linking us to the Clintons article that was posted. The content of the article is false and it contains my personal information along with others. It is defamatory and illegal. I want to ask you guys to take it down because at the point I am fearing for my life with the comments on the page especially that they have access to my address. Please take it down before I file a lawsuit against Reddit.</p>
<p>2) This post contains personal information!! The woman referenced is a 21 year old student who is involved in a nonprofit, nothing more. I know her well and these accusations are ridiculous and unfounded. Her organization won the award from the Clinton foundation as she won several rounds of voting, and I voted for her in each of them. She is currently contacting the police as this is harassment. It is the wrong person. The man who owns the non-profit does not own the pizza place. This is harming the reputation of an organization dedicated to fighting against the cause you are supposedly rallying against. You have allowed false material to be published including the names and pictures of innocent hardworking people and their nonprofit and implying they somehow have a connection with child sexual trafficking. </p>

<p><strong>1) It's been researched out in other subs both on /r/conspiracy and /r/the_donald that the owner of the business is Andrew Kline.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) The graphic posted stated the owner as Ibrahima Diallo without any information at all on how that conclusion was drawn. Comments pointed to Diallo being listed on the domain registration. This was not enough.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3) No work was done to ensure this Diallo is the same Diallo. At least not anything that I could see on the post.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We have to be careful to do the proper research. This takes actual work. The post stayed up for quite some time with no real weight or additional digging being done. If someone can make a more direct link between Besta and Diallo, and then show in greater detail that the Besta Diallo is the same Diallo tied to Hope of Guinea please submit the post with more detail.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We want the same things as you and we need to work together. We have to uphold some kind of standard as to how this is done. Not every post removal is "omg we're being censored!!!" -- we have to cover our asses here.</strong></p></p>

        <p><p>No no no - there is a STRONG link here. Did you not see the WHOIS?</p>
<p>THe WHOIS for Besta IS  Ibrahima Diallo. The orphanage is headed by a name of the same name. The addresses are withing a few miles of each other.</p>
<p>Also, he's in the Wikileaks emails (Podesta) wihich mentions the orphanage. All this info was in that thread.</p></p>

        <p><p>reddit is the wrong place in general for this kind of stuff. it's a cucked platform. better off renting a server in china or russia, registering a domain on joker.com with fake details, and creating an invite only team where everything stays private.  </p>
<p>look how easily CTR paid their way into mod status on /*/politics</p>
<p>reddit is the worst possible platform for this kind of stuff. only upside is that it's stable and it can handle massive traffic. someone needs to setup a reddit clone script and give out private invites. </p>

<p>something like that (but better) would work.</p></p>

Are we all just being plated in someone's sick idea of a joke? Is this The Matrix - did we find a simulation in a simulation!? Man, this is spooking me out.</p></p>

<p>If anyone is reading this than can help, then reach out please. </p>
<p>The issue here is who can we trust!?</p>
<p>I'm not sure i even trust pastebin/imagr etc. Who owns these companies?</p>
<p>I woudn't even trust a VPN. Especially if it's US/EU/UK run.</p>

        <p><p>Up until last night, they we're openly trading babies, we're surrounded by a community of pedophiles. The top post was a picture of a boy and about thousands of comments insinuating what they would do with him. The second post was literally a screencap of people trading two "pizzas" for $3000. The way they talk about it is sick, they've been doing this for a long time. The top post on there had like 8000 upvotes too it's a huge community.</p>
<p>They've been in full crisis mode since they were exposed last night, cleaning up anything they really.</p></p>

<p>If you seriously think a recipe post to r/keto from over a year ago somehow has a hidden message...you all need to take a long hard look in the mirror.</p>
<p>Please leave me out of all this, I contacted my friend this morning when I saw a post with her personal information on r/all and that is it. I deleted my comments because I don't want to be the next victim of any witch hunt.</p></p>
