<strong>Anyone have the archive of the tunnels being dug?</strong>
<p><p>I remember a pic from the comet Instagram that showed two guys digging a tunnel. Does anyone know where I can find that one?</p></p>

<p><p>Can't speak for the rest but the first pic is clearly the inside of a  DC restaurant called Centrolina. All you have to do is google it and its mentioned in the IG messages. I'm all on board w/ pizzagate but posting stuff without even a little effort is gonna derail this whole thing and help with the FAKE NEWS crap we know is coming. http://dc.eater.com/2016/4/26/11513204/amanda-cook-pilkerton-centrolina-veloce-celebrates-anniversary-dc</p></p>

<p><p>It says in the comments on the photograph: jimmycomet@scummimgs we meeting at core offices not #centrolina. Doesnt that mean NOT centrolina though. Oh I dont know though. It looks like two different places to me.</p></p>
