        <p><p>I agree on both fronts.</p>
<p>But think of what would happen if someone put the information together in an easily understandable format, hard copy and just put it in every mail box on the street.  No one would have to know where it came from but you better believe people will be at least asking what that was all about.  Just an idea though.</p></p>

        <p><p>Ok so there is this one thing thats bothering me for a while. Let's say that you're trying to run a highly secret pedo ring. You go out of your way to use an elaborate code system to try and hide your communication. You encrypt files and create a store front to hide the operation. Why the fuck would you undermine the whole thing with a few dumb instagram posts? Why would you purposefully make your front that's trying to hide your pedo ring suspicious at all? Comet ping pong could have looked exactly like any other pizza restaurant, yet they draw attention to themselves. </p></p>

        <p><p>Because you're fucking untouchable. You've got a code language, politicians on your side funneling the children right to you, underground chambers, legit facade businesses. You own the neighborhood. You've got it made. </p>
<p>It almost kind of takes away from what is probably part of the initial draw for these sick faggots. It's taboo. It's wrong. It's risky. But anymore it's none of those things. It hardly feels like living on the edge anymore, the process is refined and failsafe. </p>
<p>So a little "covert" bragging in public between friends provides a little bit of that dangerous feeling, that excitement. Plus, this system is foolproof and you'll never get caught. </p></p>

        <p><p>Because you are the 49th most powerful person in DC that gets invited to the White House before michelin star people.</p>
<p>Why is Mr. Comet Pizza the 49th most powerful person in DC, where there are a shit ton of congressmen and very powerful individuals? Why does Soros help fund the pizza place?</p>
<p>It doesn't make any sense. The most probable thing is that these people are degenerate idiots and the elites gave them money for this business providing them with legal security, so it gave them a feeling that they were not doing anything bad as long as we don't expose anything.</p>
<p>However, have you ever had a secret with someone in a group? And when you were together with that person you would sometimes joke outloud about that secret in a mysterious manner? This is the same thing. You think you have your back covered (World Elites). But when other people of the group start questioning you, you really have no where to go, because you yourself exposed yourself.</p>
<p>These people are degenerate idiots, that's why they own a fucking pizza place and post pictures of toddlers with sexual innuendo. If they were smart, they wouldn't have done it.</p></p>

        <p><p>I can imagine that they still want to be found by other people in the 'scene'. By hiding in plain sight, using derivatives of certain symbols, so they still have some plausible deniability and can write it off as 'coincidence'. 
The posts in itself mean not so much, and can be interpreted as some bad sense of humor, and nobody would think much of it.</p>
<p>Only because of the leaked e-mails, things start to add up, otherwise nobody would ever have paid any attention to of it.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not convinced by pizzagate at all, but this is one of the first real reasons I have read on here that makes sense for operating this way at all.
It is still shaky because it relies on the fact that they would wanna be sought out instead of them approaching people they know wouldn't rat them out.</p></p>

        <p><p>I try to keep an open mind, knowing there have been multiple cases of higher up people getting convicted for child porn and abuse, including a massive cover-up in my own country where the former minister of justice warned the guy that police was coming, the case was closed and reopened years later, a key witness got hit by a car in Cambodia just a few days before the trial, and the case is now closed again (look up Joris Demmink case). It makes me want to believe, but then I see a post of someone confusing obviously legit emails from an animal shelter for some hidden code and such things tend to take away a lot of credibility.
Of course all kinds of people are looking and trying to connect dots, and a lot of misinformation is inevitable. It's a matter of sifting out what seems plausible. Some things can seem just a coincidence on its own, but all added up can form a pretty clear case.</p></p>

        <p><p>Never underestimate people's arrogance. But you have a good point. Local police stations regularly catch people on instagram and facebook doing illegal activities. Even the smartest of us slip up. Just look at El Chapo, or Dred Pirate Roberts or whatever his name was. These were billionaire criminals that alluded authorities for years. In fact, Dred Pirate Roberts should've gotten away easily, but he slipped up, forgot to log into a proxy or something and eventually got caught. He wasn't even arrogant, just extremely paranoid, but still got nabbed over a simple mistake. </p></p>

        <p><p>Red cross reports from those years. R. Dommergue, a Jewish professor, discredited the Holocaust.</p>
<p>You can look at the red cross document. Or also, look at: http://www.worldalmanac.com/ 
They have databases of human populations.</p>
<p><em>Number of Jews in the World</em></p>
<p><strong>Before the war:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>World Almanac 1929 (p. 727): 15,630,000 </li>
<li>World Almanac 1936 (p. 748): 15,753,633 </li>
<li>World Almanac 1938 (p. 510): 15,748,091 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>During the war:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>World Almanac 1940 (p. 129): 15,319,359 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>After the war:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>World Almanac 1947: (p. 748): 15,688,259 </li>
<li>World Almanac 1948: (p. 849): 15,763,630 </li>
</ul>
<p>If you were educated like me, the history books talked about mass exterminations of Jews during the war. The numbers don't lie. Where is the 6 milion decline? It was propaganda that is now history. </p>
<p>The Jews declared war on the Germans around 1933, they wanted to exterminate the German race, this is seen in letters from the Jewish leaders and also some of their propaganda: http://www.wintersonnenwende.com/scriptorium/english/archives/articles/jdecwar.html</p>
<p>The germans did not want the war, they wanted to renegotiate the humilitaing stanza the world had set upon them after the WWI. The Jews where pushing for boycott and financial humiliation. After years of tension, they came to many accords in the  "Munich Agreement". They were broken in the "Night of the Broken Glass", where a Jew Teenager killed a German Diplomat in Paris. This enfuriated the Germans to a point of no return, and this sparred the deportations of jews.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that Jews were not mal treated during the war, but much of what you know as to be true might be propaganda to force that current generation to act a certain way in favour of the Jews (wars for the creation of Israel short after) and in order for future generations believe one thing, when in reality, things might have been different.</p>
<p>Also, the jews had a treaty signed with Great Britan that if they won the first world war, Great Britan would help relocate 6 milion jews to Palestine, now Israel. This didin't happen in 1918 becuase Great Britan thought that it was nonsense. The jewish leaders were mad.</p>
<p>Documents, letters and numbers don't lie. These are just pieces of information, but you can make a more truthful history book than the ones they are giving to us and our children, just by connecting treaties, numbers and documents.</p></p>

<p>Just different.</p>
<p>The majority of people are too pre-occupied with either day-to-day life or general bullshit to look into this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Meaning those who do will either be those with too much time on their hands, or those who have been rejected from, or just not been interested in 'mainstream culture' if that's a thing.</p>
<p>So they will be 'different'. Not fucking nuts though, despite what the (((MSM))) would like you to think.</p>
<p>Also people who aren't interested in questioning this kind of stuff would see this, and write it off as conspiracy theory whackos. Thanks for that David Icke.</p></p>

<p>I don't know...probe those depths of your perception on your own time, or at least add a little more substance to the conversation if you're here to critique.</p>
<p>The Clinton's are being investigated because the Clinton Foundation is implicated in these crimes.  This sub has been discussing the evidence that has led us to this point.  If you're missing something, that's on you.</p></p>

<p>There are no ongoing lawsuits involving Trump and sex abuse. He was casually acquainted with Epstein because they are both billionaires and run in similar social circles. </p>
<p>Bill Clinton on the other hand flew on the "Lolita Express" <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/05/13/flight-logs-show-bill-clinton-flew-on-sex-offenders-jet-much-more-than-previously-known.html">26 times (according to verifiable flight logs) even ditching his secret service detail for some.</a></p></p>

<p>Seems Trump is being accused of exactly what Bill 'might' have been doing.</p>
<p>Love how if Trump and Epstein are friends it's only because "they're both billionares" but if Bill and Epstein are friends are friends it's because they're both pedos.</p></p>

        <p><p>Also, I think it's funny that you want Trump to be a pedophile based on less association with Epstein than Bill has had. HI-larious.  </p></p>

        <p><p>That has nothing to do with what wikileaks has unveiled, which has been the foundation of pizzagate.</p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks, TBH I'm new here and just learning about pizzagate.</p>
<p>It wasn't until after I posted that, I realized what pizzagate is all about.</p>
<p>Thanks for clearing it up. My bad everyone.</p></p>

        <p><p>Because Clintons and Clinton Foundation are implied in the case? You know that Trump was the only one who cooperated with Authorities during the Insane Epstein trial? Bill Clinton And Prince Andrew (Brother of Prince Charles) and many other famous people were involved in the Epstein Pedophily trial as Co-conspirators. THey all got immunity. Epstein was found guilty of pedophily. Also found a Level 3 pedophile, very likely to do it again. There were 40 victims. from 12 to 16 years of age.</p></p>

        <p><p>Awesome Strawman Argument.  Trump and Clinton's involvement wouldn't be mutually exclusive, in the hypothetical you presented.  That said, we have no concrete evidence to tie Trump to any of these alleged crimes.</p>
<p>We do, however, have evidence tying the Clinton's to these alleged crimes.  Hence, they're being mentioned and Trump is not.</p>
<p>Really not that complicated, buddy.</p></p>
