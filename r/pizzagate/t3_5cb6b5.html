        <strong>Alright, I was convinced to look around a little. Potential for something interesting.</strong>
        <p><p>So, I stumbled across this subreddit just today I think, and I am not going to lie I was pretty astounded. I have never heard of this stuff, but I read the posts, and watched some videos, and now I am convinced to hop aboard. So let me get to it.  </p>
<p>After reading this post<br>
https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5c755i/ping_pong_password_area/  </p>
<p>There was a person in the comments with an imgur link showing he got through the password link, and then there were downloadable files that needed a key to download. This is really what tipped me, what the fuck do they have this for? Anyway I went to comet ping pong site and poked around. I went to there e mail listing page.  </p>
<p>http://www.cometpingpong.com/mailing-list/  </p>
<p>I happen to be a computer science major. To me, that image on the left has steganography written all over it. If you don't know, steganography is the process of hiding a file/message/image/etc within another file/message/image/etc. The image is a jpeg, and jpeg is usually seen as bad for steganography, however, steganography is still possible with jpeg images.  </p>
<p>Maybe it is nothing, maybe it is something I thought I would post anyways. I do not currently have any sort of knowledge to decrypt the message, which usually requires a password. I will dig into it as a side project.  </p></p>

        <p><p>It appears that people at 4chan (pol, Eyes Wide Open threads) are still working on processing/analyzing the files they were able get from these directories. They're aware of the possibility of steganography being used. Not a lot of info so far. </p></p>
