    Anyways...Auerbach Realty Holdings (president Lorna Auerbach) outsources its property management to Kennedy Wilson.

    Lorna Auerbach has been fundraising for "Cities Empowered Against Sex Trafficking" since March 2016.

     The fact that you are getting downvotes proves this sub is compromised. Everyone here is upvoting ridiculous garbage allegations. 8 Chan is even getting out of control. I'm worried we spooked them and they're too on to us now to get anything proven further. Focus on Clinton foundation, comet ping pong and besta. Fbi anon is all we have to go on...

      Apparently someone on 4chan found a file embedded in the email about putanesca sauce. This needs to be highest priority.

      Nobody can really drive priorities. If you want something done you have to do it yourself.

    Skipolini's in (CA) is actually a chain restaurant. Its kid friendly (not pedo, just they dont mind kids running around, being loud) the one i've been to has a play area for kids (in the patio area so parents can keep an eye on the kids while eating)
   </p>
   <p>
    The kid friendly environment is the whole theme of the place; there arent many decent restaurants where kids can go and actually not be at the table the whole time (especially in upper class areas they tend to be located.)
   </p>
   <p>
    Its a nice place to have dinner if you have kids because the kids can go play in a gated/safe area while the adults can relax and talk.
   </p>
   <p>
    Honestly, if there were something going on at this place it would he a huge surprise and likely an isolated incident. I have several friends and family who frequent Skipolini's, many of which are law enforcement.
   </p>
   <p>
    Also the pizza that is supposed to induce labor is tongue in cheek. It has so many toppings its supposed to fill you up and push the baby out.
