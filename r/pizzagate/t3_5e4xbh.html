        <strong>List of victims who have spoken out against against abuse by high ranking public figures?</strong>
        <p><p>I was wondering if we could compile a list of victims who have spoken out against sexual abuse commited by high ranking figures.</p>
<p>I've seen plenty of posts about this but I've hardly ever looked into it more. Maybe if we create a list with sources this will be easier to research</p></p>

        <p><p>I was just looking this up this Morning. I now believe they are all telling the truth too. There will be a long list I am sure. Lots of them mind control Victims would be a good start too.</p></p>
