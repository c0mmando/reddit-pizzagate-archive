        <strong>MONEY LAUNDERING FOR MILLIONAIRES - PODESTA BROTHERS & THE FAMILY THAT BOUGHT INTO THE UN - QATAR</strong>
        <p><p>We got your paintings Pooodesssttaa!!!    </p>
<p>First things first - Qatar is a family business. They have created false bureaucracy to conceal this. They are buying influence in every sector and industry in Europe and now the US. Any reference to a Qatari government agency e.g. Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), Qatar Museum Authority (QMA) can be translated to "the family dictatorship"    </p>

<strong>On March 26, 2014, a week after John Podesta made his remarks about the environmental movement and fracking, Tony had a meeting with the White House. On April 4 and August 4, the logs show, Tony Podesta met with John Podesta in the White House.</strong>     </p>
<p>QIA is estimated to hold in excess of $170 billion of assets an amount that is expected to significantly increase as the state completes its <strong>expansion projects to become the world's largest liquefied natural gas exporter with 77 million tons output capacity.</strong> (Thanks, Podesta.)</p>

<p>Some of Qatar’s favorite artists   <br>
Damien Hirst- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Hirst   <br>
    Qatar recently bought a piece of his art, smashing the record for price paid for a piece by living artist.   <br>
    On 10 September 2002, on the eve of the first anniversary of the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks, Hirst said in an interview with BBC News Online:
<strong>"The thing about 9/11 is that it's kind of like an artwork in its own right. It was wicked, but it was devised in this way for this kind of impact. It was devised visually... You've got to hand it to them on some level because they've achieved something which nobody would have ever have thought possible, especially to a country as big as America. So on one level they kind of need congratulating, which a lot of people shy away from, which is a very dangerous thing."</strong>     </p>
<p>Louise Bourgeois   <br>
Takashi Murakami   <br>
Richard Serra   <br>
Jeff Koons   <br>
Mark Rothko     </p>
<p>The Qatari family was reportedly the buyer behind both Paul Cezanne’s The Card Players, for $250 million in 2012, and Paul Gauguin‘s When Will You Marry, sold for a reported $300 million in 2015—two of the most expensive art deals in history—though the works have never actually been openly displayed in the country.</p>

"While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region."   <br>
<strong>Qatar Investment Authority owns (100%) Qatar Holding LLC, and is associated with Qatar National Bank (50%).

<p><strong>MARIE-JOSEE KRAVIS</strong>   <br>
QMA board member and a prominent economist   <br>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie-Jos%C3%A9e_Kravis <br>
She serves on the international advisory board of the <strong>Federal Reserve Bank of New York</strong> and on the boards of Publicis S.A. and LVMH. Since 1989 she has <strong>attended virtually all conferences of the Bilderberg Group</strong> (except the one in 1997) and <strong>serves on its steering committee.</strong>      </p>
<h1>Infiltrate Industry</h1>
<p>Since becoming an economic power house, Qatar has invested heavily into a diverse portfolio of critical industries, amassing a substantial stake in many companies. Starting with the U.K. and Western Europe, they have had great success investing profitably - and not only economically. By simply reaching into their billfold, Qatar has successfully established intelligence assets within all major European industries.      </p>
<p>First here are a couple of news articles, then below I will aim to detail some examples of Qatari holdings.    <br>

        <p><p>I spent a couple hours looking into Hitomi Financial. They are the highest paying company to the Podesta Group. This was tracked down  either here or on one of the chans but the are an offshore shell company. What makes it even harder is that Hitomi is a name in another language, so sorting through links is brutal. </p>
<p>Worst part, and don't use this as evidence until I can track it again, is I thought I was onto a Qatar connection and had around 100 tabs open, forgot to save it and closed them all. </p>
<p>I think we should look to every single dollar that goes in and out on record. We have a lot of people, we just need a firm direction. </p></p>

        <p><p>im from Qatar and this doesn't really add up.</p>
<p>The country had a huge boner for international recognition and spend to get it.</p>
<p>Your conclusions are fairly wrong.</p>
<p>A lot of Qataris hate Damien Hurst cause he does fucked up 'art' with animals.</p>
<p>but one pretentious manchild likes him a lot so he spends government money to get his crap art in the country and his name attached to our museums -.-</p>
<p>im already legally in trouble for writing this because Saudi and the UAE pressured Qatar into signing a "Cyber Security Law" that makes it illegal to insult members of the ruling family across the gulf/gcc.</p>
<p>If you want fucked up shit. Look at those 2. Qatar likes to involve itself in politics but its a small country. Those Saudi and the UAE play a whole different game.</p></p>

        <p><p>I can't blame them for trying.</p>
<p>That cyber security law was passed also as a way to pressure the government to reign in Al-Jazeera English's broadcasting. I doubt they managed to interfere with the network much given they report on stuff like Yemen which Saudi wouldn't want the world to see.</p></p>

        <p><p>If you vaporize a hole of granite below a building it will be accelerated upward  slightly (from the expanding ground below+mild shockwave, crunching the building), and then fall into the perfect molten sphere carved out below it. </p></p>

        <p><p>That's not how a thermonuclear explosion works. Let me link you a video. It simply melts and vaporizes the rock around it, creating a large cavern. </p>

        <p><p>You don't get it... the building was crushed between the ground being pushed up and the weight of the tower. When the explosion went off it crushed the building causing the missile-struck area to crunch first, creating the top to bottom implosion. </p></p>
