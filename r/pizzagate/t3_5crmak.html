<strong>Can someone help me find an email?</strong>
<p><p>I'm looking for an email that was released on Wikileaks within the past few weeks. I don't remember all the details, but it was about Haiti and the help it recieved from the Clinton Foundation and issues that arose. In it, a question came up about the use of orphanages for displaced children, and why a Haiti based organization wasn't used. </p>
<p>This may be nothing, but this particular email came to mind today, and I would like to find out more about the orgs mentioned. I tried searching myself, but am having a hard time finding it, and was hoping someone from this sub could help me out. Thank you!</p>
<p>EDIT: Hey guys, I found what I was looking for! <br/>

<p>Thank you guys for your input, and any additional info will also help!</p></p>

<p><p>Look in Hillary's emails for "Silsby" -- she tried to get 33 children over the border in a bus, with no passports. </p></p>

<p><p>Was that recently released? The advanced search is showing "5" but when selected, it's giving me 0 results. Idk what I'm doing wrong.</p></p>

<p><p>I looked into this a bit. Maybe this is where my search was taking me to. I would still like to find the email in question though. Thank you for your help!</p></p>

<p><p>There was a batch of Haiti emails released by FOIA, not WikiLeaks. I'm on my phone at the moment so it's not so easy for me to find them. Could that be it? </p></p>

<p><p>It's possible. I'm pretty sure I read it in the Wikileaks sub, so maybe that's where I'm getting that from. I think it was like a forwarded email or doc outlining all the red tape aid worker had to deal with and issues that hindered aid. Sorry this is so vague, I'm trying to remember anything that I can about it. Is this ringing any bells for anyone?</p></p>

<p><p>I lightly skimmed through the FOIA Haiti docs and don't remember Orphanages, but everything else sounds right. They were getting bad press leading up to the Haiti elections.</p>
<p>Seems to me that was a big deal day, like FOIA, FBI,  and WL all released something the same day. Try looking at the FBI Vault on twitter.  </p></p>

<p><p>Additional info - the email also pointed out how aid was delayed, both financially and in regards to military aid. </p></p>
