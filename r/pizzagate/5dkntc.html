   <strong>
    SIMPLE effective strategy
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Guys let's make this simple. This hasn't reached he mainstream yet because it only exists still on reddit and twitter if you know what you're looking for.
   </p>
   <p>
    I promise this WILL die out if the information doesn't spread mainstream within days.
   </p>
   <p>
    Keep investigating leads... but most importantly, get this out mainstream NOW!
   </p>
   <p>
    Find people with MODERATE influence. It will be easier than MSM or moguls (which many are in on it anyways). Reach out to people with moderate followings on their podcasts/ YouTube channels/ musicians/. Friends/ family etc. we need people with moderate sized platforms to have the courage to spread this.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you know people in other countries push it there- it will go viral if those countries aren't censored like we are. Other countries love discussing what America is doing wrong (Maybe Australian 60 minutes will do one on this like they did for the U.K.)
   </p>
   <p>
    To truly help- begin calling/ messaging/ emailing/ tweeting people to use their platform to discuss this. Eventually this will force large outlets and personalities to address it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Keep info basic! Don't start with satanic or human ritual sacrifice in the header. Make it enough to entice curiosity so they will read it without being so "audacious" they don't want to read after seeing the title.
   </p>
   <p>
    Don't make it about just the dems. Say OUR govt, because it's the truth and it will make dems less defensive thinking it's all right wing nuts coming after them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Guys we have more than enough info to make this VIRAL. Not enough for a smoking gun. Efforts need to be spent right now on spreading this to as many people as possible before momentum dies.
   </p>
   <p>
    Our country and children's lives depend on it...

    I think the best way to segway interest is to rile up peoples disgust towards pedophiles and then ease them into this info expressing why it's so important to follow through.
   </p>
   <p>
    One could easily say "Oh the DNC and such could be involved in Pedo activities." But when you say it like that, you come off sounding crazy.
   </p>
   <p>
    However if you start off by explaining the codes behind it, showing pictures, and cryptic tags that make no sense til you put the pedo code together and then explain the DNC's involvement, I feel that would get more people involved.
   </p>
   <p>
    But the first step to pulling it off is reminding people at the end of the day this is about Child Trafficking and exploitation, it just happens that noteable figures are linked to these heinous actions but we can't let it be used as a way to divert attention from the main purpose of the subreddits goal. And that's to seek justice for these children, to hope to save some and take down the people involved.
   </p>
   <p>
    You in a way have to downplay the names and show the proof to explain why it's pretty legit, and then you can say "oh btw look at the people involved" and it will be more believable because you have given them info that is easier to digest before hitting them with the hard potential facts of known people involved in this shady business.

    All of these are great ideas. Keep up the brain storming and I'll be sure to share with ideas with the mods and with the other forums.

     Thank you... one other thought. Pizzagate is a TERRIBLE name. Literally awful for what it is supposed to be encompassing.
    </p>
    <p>
     It gives outsiders zero idea what it is, and even sounds more like it's a joke... I know it's already gained steam and awareness but it would be good to change names if we still can.

      I agree. Mods and the community were talking about that the other day. It's hard to change course especially on a name when you're this committed. It's hard as it is for anyone to view the topic as a whole as anything but conspiracy because even the truth is so wild and so mind blowing that it's hard for many to accept.

       I think we come up with a new name here. We can keep pizzagate and add whatever the new name is on twitter. #pizzagate #HumanTRadegate or whatever.... eventually if everyone tweets both hashtags it will catch on.
      </p>
      <p>
       On here everyone creates it so maybe a 2nd channel to start. This sub can be going down the rabbit hole / further investigation. The new one can be old/ compiled info.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again just thoughts... just the name is going to work against us. It definitely is on twitter and in person. People are like wtf r u talking about.

        I agree, I'll talk with the rest of the mods in the morning and get their opinion on the matter. We definetly need to get our name to better represent our claim or we need a new name all together. Publicity is key. Keep up the good work.
