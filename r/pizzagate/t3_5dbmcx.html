        <strong>Strategy for redpilling</strong>
        <p><p>I think just dumping a link like https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55433 and saying "oh look at this weird language" isn't necessarily going to gain much traction with normies.</p>
<p>I was thinking a better strategy might be to make infographics which make the reader think about weird wording but they anticipate the concluding wording of an email.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>"The realtor found a handkerchief"</p>
<p>Seem innocuous enough right?</p>
<p>"The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a spill)"</p>
<p>Oh, that sounds fairly normal.</p>
<p>"The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map)"</p>
<p>Uhh, I guess you could have a handkerchief with a map design on it...</p>
<p>"The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a spill that seems pizza-related)"</p>
<p>That makes sense that they're articulating where the uncleanness on it came from.</p>
<p>"The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related.)"</p>
<p>Umm, that makes no sense whatsoever...</p>
<p>Attention grabbing text: what are they really talking about</p>
<p>Then cite/link to wikileaks</p></p>
