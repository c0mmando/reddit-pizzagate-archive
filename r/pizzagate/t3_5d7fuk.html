<p><p>I slowed the speed down, didn't anticipate anything that could be said, and to me I don't hear "help", I hear "hey!". As if the child noticed something, and would you look at that, they're playing ping pong on the street. What kid would not be interested in that? And what kid would be mad that their parents don't care and force them along anyways? All of them.</p></p>

<p><p>Kids can actually be quite clever. If their parents are forcing them to do something they don't want to do, it would not surprise me that a kid would scream for help even though they don't really need it. It's like telling your parents they abuse you because they won't buy you a new toy. Kids will scream and say anything to get what they want.</p></p>

<p><p>Say what you will, but I have a hard time believing the screams are coming from the pizza place. I doubt the canera could pick up screams from inside the restaurant over the sounds of outdoor pingpong, 4 lanes of metropolitan traffic and general background noise. </p></p>

<p><p>I second this. Those screams are way too loud to be contained anywhere and I would be surprised that no one in the area heard them.</p>
<p>If you look carefully you will see a family walking by, hard to see completely because of the cars but from what I can see they have a couple of children with them. It looks like one is between the two and possibly a smaller one being held. It would make more sense that these kids were misbehaving or just screaming from excitement/anger/whatever kids scream about. The screams seem to stop once the family has passed by, and the screams are the loudest when they are directly across from the camera.</p></p>

<p><p>He glances back after the guy retrieves the ball from the bush and is heading back. Most likely the movement of the guy from the bush combined with his kid screaming caused him to glance back, but he realizes its nothing and keeps walking. His head is not turned for more than a second.</p></p>

<p><p>What if they weren't in the pizza place, but instead they were in the underground tunnels that run all over the place in that location? Could the camera pick up sound coming through a vent or gutter?</p></p>

<p><p>what are the odds of that happening? (No one can say for sure.) But I can tell you if i filmed the five closest pizza shops near me, nothing close to how eerie that sounded would show up in the audio (Again cant say for sure.) Just so strange.</p></p>

<p><p>Not to even engage in your conspiracy here but any tunnel under Connecticut Avenue is going to have to be heavily reinforced with concrete.</p>

<p><p>the sound is comming fround the ground ( sound travels better trough solid objects then trough air )    <br/>
The mic will pick up sound from the ground that we personaly would not be able to hear ( reason why peeps in the past put there ear to the ground to lissen for horse riders )    <br/>
The sound is not comming from pingpong pizza ( but from the ground or from behind the camera )  <br/>
Sins the sound of the voice is muffled i would believe its sound reverberating from the ground </p></p>

<p><p>Take an empty soup can and run a 100 foot string to a second can.  Have someone talk into it.  Sound can travel in strange ways.  Standing next to a good metal conductor might pick up voices from a basement 100 feet away.  It happens.</p></p>

<p><p>Very hard to see because of the cars but there is a family walking past the ping pong table. The screams are the loudest when they are across from the camera, and seem to stop when they leave frame. If you look carefully you can see a little girl (I'm assuming) between a couple and if I'm not mistaken the man is holding an even smaller child. If I would have to guess it would be that the girl was throwing a tantrum from not being able to play (she seems to stretch her hand out toward the table), or it's coming from the smaller kid. The first scream sounds like a generic kid screaming for whatever reason. Either way, the screams are way too loud for them to be coming from inside anywhere. At one point it's louder than the traffic, people would've heard them.</p>
<p>EDIT: I took screenshots of the family. I am now 100% sure that nothing sinister is going on in this video. You can clearly see the family and the little kid's interest in the ping pong game. If you listen to the video on slow motion the first scream sounds like a generic child's scream. The next big scream sounds like "hey!" or "daddy!" Then "nooo", probably because they want to check out the game more and it seems like the parents are even dragging the kid along before they go off frame. You can also see the kid constantly looking back toward the game.</p>

<p><p>Isn't that really this entire subreddit though? This entire Pizzagate thing seems like nothing but taking something utterly harmless and trying incredibly hard to relate it to pedophilia because what better way to think of your 'enemy' as a literal monster? I've seen generic company logos being supposed "pedophile symbols", I've seen people saying kids with open mouths on a Pizza site is proof of rape, and now this stuff. Quite honestly nothing to come out of this yet feels like proof of anything other than overactive imaginations.</p></p>

<p><p>In a different thread, people were claiming that pizza parties for kids in school when we were growing up is evidence that this vast conspiracy was trying to "normalize" pizza to make it easier to cover their tracks. This shit is HILARIOUS. </p></p>

<p><p>There's a lot of convincing evidence but like any conspiracy theory that gets "big", especially with its own subreddit, you will get a lot of bored/crazy people jumping in and shitting it up. I'd keep an eye on pizzagate but you'll have to sift through the bullshit and conjecture. </p></p>

<p><p>There are some coincidences that are hard to ignore but nothing that is concrete evidence. I have never known anyone to be as obsessed with Pizza as they are showing this guy to be, so it does beg the question of why is he so obsessed and does he really mean pizza? But for the most part I think everyone wants to be Sherlock Holmes, so they find any piece of anything and force it to relate to pizza and/or this "scandal". </p></p>

<p><p>I am with you on this one. The kid across the street is clearly trying to get someone's attention. Pretty sure he's making the noise.</p>
<p>While this video is pretty week, there is a lot of other evidence for pizzagate that can't be so easily dismissed.</p></p>

<p><p>YOU'RE the troll. You're trolling all the pizzagate threads with this disgusting pseudo-intellectual smugness like you know something everyone else doesn't, when you're very clearly in the minority. Newsflash: only a complete idiot or someone who is too afraid to admit they were wrong for supporting Hillary would say there's nothing here. So, which is it?</p></p>

<p><p>Pointing out logical gaps in the narrative isn't trolling. Sorry if that ruffles your feathers, but that's your problem, not mine.</p>
<p>Neither. I just require facts to back up extraordinary claims. Internet conspiracy theories based on wild speculation and loose connections doesn't quite do it for me. Sorry for being "pseudo-intellectual" because I appreciate verifiable evidence. I will continue to hang around and wait for that evidence to present itself because it is an interesting story, but so far all this sub has proven is the owner of the pizza place has a creepy Instagram account.</p>
<p>Congrats on realizing I'm one of the millions of people who voted for Hillary. I guess that makes me inherently wrong about everything in the world for the rest of time? This sub is apolitical last I checked, so I'm not sure what that gets you other than a half chub for typing mean things at a Hillary voter. Good for you?</p></p>

<p><p>This sub IS apolitical, and remains that way for the most part. I was making the connection that when comments like yours do pop up, claiming there's nothing here (again, a tiny, tiny minority), THAT person tends to be politically-motivated. And you very clearly are.</p>
<p>So you can pretend all day that there's nothing to see here, but you and I both know you're being dishonest with yourself. And for what? Pride in your political party? Huge LOL.</p>
<p>Edit: The self-aggrandizing with you is off the charts. I suppose this is you 'pointing out the logical gaps in narrative': If it makes you feel any better, none of this is real. </p>
<p>Get real, man, you're only fooling yourself. And look at what you're defending. How do people even get to the point you're at? So engrossed in the two-party charade that being blue has become your entire identity. You'll fight tooth and nail to defend the establishment because you identify as it.</p></p>

<p><p>I think it's hilarious that someone who doesn't agree with your conspiracy theory must be politically motivated against you. I hated Hillary (I also think it's funny you didn't post all those old comments), but voted against Trump. I have nothing political to gain here, just want to break the echo chamber that has somehow convinced all of you that this theory is legitimate. At least not yet.</p></p>

<p><p>Let's try to be a bit more journalistic about this.  There is nothing clear or conclusive about this.  Kids have tantrums like this all the time.  We need to make our titles a bit less sensational and sure of themselves.  As this whole thing is starting to grow and pick up attention, we need to be credible in our analysis.</p>
<p>It's evidently early enough for a family of four to be walking around (and as /u/DaarioNuharis points out, the screaming might be from that kid), even if it's not we might also assume those are a couple of patrons playing outside and they don't seem bothered about the screaming at all.  Now, let's be realistic, if they were actually abducting a kid at this point, do you think they wouldn't be able to cover the kids mouth and restrain them?  Conversely, if a child were having a temper tantrum in a restaurant, do you think most parents would gag their children in public or would they try to calm them down despite the screaming? </p>
<p>I'm honestly starting to wonder if the shills aren't the ones dismissing stuff, but are the ones pushing really weak evidence. </p></p>

<p><p>You know you can just go eat at Comet Ping Pong right? Its a restaurant. If there were kids inside being audibly raped, the restaurant goers would report it.</p></p>

<p><p>I can't make out what the kid is saying. But since the people were just playing ping pong and not reacting, I would imagine it wasn't what we are looking for.</p></p>

<p><p>Who knows, the camera is set low to the ground and those crappy video camera mics pick up sound differently than your ears would. Standing there you would hear a lot more bass and city noise to distract your ears. It could be the camera was the only one hearing them, barely coming through a vent in the sidewalk.</p></p>

<p><p>If your ear would pick up "bass and city noise" and not the screams, yet the camera can pick up the screams but not the "bass and city noise", how does that make sense? In-Camera mics aren't magic and are mostly really shitty because they capture everything in the area. If you were in the area you would be able to hear everything a built-in camera's mic would. Not to mention that the loudest scream is when the family is right across from the camera with no cars in the way or driving by.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm not saying I believe in this theory, but every microphone has a different EQ curve/filter.. And low quality mics would definitely catch higher frequency sounds much better than low frequency (bass). It would actually work exactly how he explained it.</p>

<p><p>But what about the volume of the screams, Late_To_Parties says it would "barely" come through a vent or sidewalk, yet the screams are really loud, not to mention the obvious source that can be linked to those screams. I agree that a mic could pick up something that you may not be able to hear, but I don't believe you would hear it that loudly on the recording and not in person and that the mic wouldn't pick up everything else in the scene that would be "distracting" you. Kid's screams and cries are a specific frequency that we as humans will notice and react to on an instinctual basis. If the screams were present and quieter, without a family walking by, then I would be more apt to believe that someone walking by wouldn't be able to hear it. But the volume of the scream picked up on the recording is just too loud. The guy who made the video would have noticed these screams when re-watching the video (if not in person) and then to not comment on them he would have to be super oblivious. So to me it's obvious that when he was there, recording, he saw the family himself and saw that there were children that were making that noise, and then disregarded the screams(in person and/or in the recording), because he already knew where the screams were coming from.</p></p>

<p><p>Just remember, I only commented on how the tech works.. That's the only help I can provide here.</p>
<p>As for wether or not the screams were coming from an abducted child, it wouldn't be rational for any of us to decide yes or no.. It's not probable, though.</p></p>

<p><p>Sounds are just vibration, which is why the soup can-string deal works. You cannot compare mics to a string that is transmitting vibration. Mics are pretty simple. They have a directional pattern depending on the mic you are using. The reason they don't use the In-Camera Mics on professional productions is because they will capture everything that they don't want to hear. That doesn't mean that it picks up things the human ear cannot. Only a specialized mic with a specific directional pattern pointed in the right direction could pick up something that you may not hear (such as a train a couple miles/blocks away, an airplane, someone walking around a couple floors away in a multi-level building), and they would be heard as super soft in the recording, not blaring loud. And they would not coincide with an obvious sound point, which is the family walking by and the kid's interest in the game. You can match the loud scream with the kid waving their hand toward the game directly across from the camera. It's hard to see because a car zooms by at the exact moment. But watch it frame by frame, see where the kid is and how they're acting, then re-watch in slow-mo, and see the screams coincide with the kid's actions.</p></p>

<p><p>Not exactly true. All microphones are different, and have different EQ curves/filters.. Cheaper microphones are actually the least predictable (and this was definitely a cheap mic)</p>
<p>I'm not saying I think there's kids trapped underneath the street, but the information being used to debunk this theory just isn't 100% accurate.</p></p>
