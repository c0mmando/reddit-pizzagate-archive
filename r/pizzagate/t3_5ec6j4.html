        <strong>One Simple Question</strong>
        <p><p>Where is the evidence of children being abused or harmed?</p>
<p>Not supposition, theory, conjecture, 'weird' videos/photos, etc. but real evidence that children have been harmed. The who, when, where etc.</p>
<p>A photo of a kid and some masking tape isn't evidence. Plenty of families have daft/one-off photos like that in their collections. I mean, we did some funny stuff on halloween that made some odd photos if you don't know the story, but that isn't evidence of anything other than kids making silly costumes.</p>
<p>Where is the evidence of real abuse?</p>
<p>Until that is available this could be seriously messing up the lives of some innocent people. </p>
<p>Innocent until proven guilty is still meant to mean something, isn't it?</p>
<p>Those paintings won't be to everyone's taste but making a weird painting is free speech, which we're supposed to be defending. This doesn't make the artist a criminal.</p>
<p>Show us some actual evidence!</p></p>

        <p><p>No-one. Not ever? Not a single person out of 7 billion on the planet? </p>
<p>Me and my brother used to bury each other in sand at the beach but that didn't mean we were training to dig graves.</p>
<p>We also used to mess around with rope and tape, making masks and stuff.</p>
<p>There's no way that the only possible interpretation of that pic is that it HAS to indicate child abuse has taken place. </p></p>

        <p><p>Ok, but we don't even know that adults did that to her. It could have been other kids; or she could have started one hand herself as a game. There are assumptions being made here that can't be backed up by the available evidence.</p>
<p>And please, there's really no need to resort to insults. I'm asking these questions because, if there is abuse here, I want to see the guilty parties brought to justice.</p>
<p>It's because the charges here are so serious that it makes sense to ask detailed questions about what's going on.</p></p>

        <p><p>If it were only that it may be enough to make a fuss but the fact that Alefantis is hanging with friends which 3 of them has been locked up for pedophilia + hanging with Tony Podesta who has distasteful art in his home of children being tied up + Comet Pizza displaying art of Ria Pratt (a former victim of pedo ring) and on and on. If that's not enough for you then I'm not sure what you're looking for.</p></p>

        <p><p>I guess 'hanging with' doesn't really seem like evidence. </p>
<p>There was a kid at my school who went to jail for murder just after graduation. I had to sit next to him on the bus a few times in the year before. Does this mean I was hanging with a future murderer?</p>
<p>What evidence is there to show a conspiracy between these people?</p>
<p>Distasteful art is not illegal, it's part of freedom of speech, which we all support. Displaying art is not illegal, that's also freedom of speech.</p>
<p>'Hanging with' could mean they all sit around plotting terrible deeds or it could be that they just ate pizza. Where is the evidence of something really bad happening or even being planned?</p></p>

        <p><p>Well- there are LOADS of CP available on the internet pretty much accessible at anybody's fingertips.  There are suspicions that the elites are involved in it, as evidenced by emails or ties to known pedos (i.e jeff epstein).  The challenge is tying the two together by finding proper evidence that proves beyond reasonable doubt that they are guilty.</p>
<p>This is an investigation, not a prosecution.  They may be innocent; but if they didn't want a (potentially character damaging) investigation done unto them by the public, then they should have been more transparent to the public about their dealings behind the scenes; oh, and they shouldn't have sent emails around talking about putting dominos and walnut sauce on pizza.</p>
<p>They are being investigated because of their own actions, not because of ours</p></p>

        <p><p>Making a painting of children getting raped is tasteless, disgusting and is in no way why we have freedom of speech. You have a distorted view of that. 
Innocent people get investigated all the time. 
There are several posts summarizing the info if you read one of those and don't see anything there then just go away, you're not helping. </p></p>

        <p><p>The problem with freedom of speech is that it allows people to say, and depict, things we don't like. Hundreds of hollywood films depict rape and many others have dealt with the issue of child abuse – this doesn't mean that the directors, actors etc. support these actions.</p>
<p>I have read the info, but still don't see any evidence of abuse. It's all conjecture. Where is the evidence everyone is getting so worked up about?</p></p>

        <p><p>Freedom of speech does not cover the intent to harm others or distribute obscene materials. Yes Hollywood has a problem. Yes there are directors who support these actions see Roman Polanski. I appreciate pushing the boundaries I think that's great. Sick pedo stuff is not that. </p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks for the link.</p>
<p>So, as I've read before, it all started with a handkerchief...</p>
<p>Does that mean that everyone who carries, or loses, a handkerchief is automatically enrolled in the handkerchief code?</p>
<p>There's a guy where I work who used white ones when he has a cold?
Should I steer clear of him now?</p></p>

<p>I wasn't intending to ridicule, so apologies for that. I was trying to ask, with a little humor, how we know that this handkerchief code was definitely being used in this case? Isn't it possible they were just returning a lost item?</p></p>

        <p><p>So, there are two things that worry me.</p>
<p>First, that this is all true and there is a top-level conspiracy covering up some evil people. That would, of course, be terrible and the law should follow through with this if there is a case.</p>
<p>Second, that this is just a load of stuff that looks weird but, whilst everyone is working it out, there are real people, and real children, who are having their lives turned upside down when it's possible that nothing illegal has taken place. There are kids here who may not have been abused but are being dragged into this without a thought for their welfare.</p>
<p>It seems either way these kids are going to get hurt. That's why I post asking for evidence of abuse. There are real lives here that could be irrevocably damaged by all of this. People will have already been hurt and if it turns out this is all for nothing then that doesn't look good for anyone.</p></p>

        <p><p>Doug Hagmann showed a picture of abuse on the Alex jones show. He says it was leaked to him from the nypd and came off of wieners computer. Last weekend, a site called "wearethepizza" owned by Andrew Kline was hacked and showed to contain a password blocked area that contained cp.</p>
<p>It's all coming out</p></p>

        <p><p>The photo Hagmann had is not real. Some backtrack the photo and it turned out to be a photo of just a regular girl. No nudity, no sexual innuendo, the photo even said piano lesson on it.</p>
<p>I thought it to be true at first but Hagmann had no reason censir the photo as it was just a random pic and not CP. It really makes me wonder about this whole situation especially cuz Hagmann is usually on point.</p></p>

        <p><p>She is a underage girl on a flight known as Lolita express headed to a private island... Since this sub is getting shut down there isn't any reason to go further about it I guess.. But both the Clintons made several trips to the island known as pedo island</p></p>

        <p><p>The way you get <strong>evidence</strong> is by running an investigation (usually by fucking law enforcement) on a suspicious person (like these guys).</p>
<p>But they won't, will they?  </p>

        <p><p>So, let me get this straight: if law enforcement can find no case to prosecute then that means this is definitely real?</p>
<p>If there's evidence of abuse why haven't they arrested anyone yet?</p></p>

        <p><p>There is evidence of abuse of one of the children from the instagram photos.</p>
<p>http://imgur.com/a/0xdVF</p>
<p>http://imgur.com/a/2aHoP</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5cu3yi/why_are_james_alefantis_owner_of_comet_pizza_and/</p>
<p>Note the PVC (bondage?) tape and marks on her arm. The marks could be from the tape or the result of photoshopping.</p>
<p>Here is the instagram from a year earlier where she's taped to the ping pong table. Notice the marks across both cheeks. Was she gagged?</p>
<p>http://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-11-12-13_53_55-Films-TV.png</p>
<p>Another from a few months earlier:</p>
<p>http://archive.is/vaDfJ</p>
<p>One of her two years earlier. Jimmy here calls her a "hotard", slang for "whore and retard".</p>
<p>http://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2FyXrV.png</p>
<p>Here she is chewing on the $1000 stacks of foreign currency:</p>
<p>http://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/zF3Ofm.png</p>
<p>Note that she has some red marks between her eyes and above her eyebrows, visible in other photos.</p>
<p>Despite the "chicken lovers" comment (meaning "gay man sexually attracted to young boys"), this is probably her too:</p>
<p>http://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-11-12-13_58_47-Films-TV.png</p>
<p>There are also dark marks under her eyes in some photos and signs of neglect.</p>
<p>She also seems to have a small philtrum and thin upper lip, symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome. FAS can result in retardation: is that the reason for Jimmy's "hotard" comment?</p>
<p>Where are her parents? The instagram photos are never posted by family.
James Alefantis often comments "#carisjames". I guess James could be her brother (from the first photo).</p></p>

        <p><p>He claims it is his Niece. Well, I can tell you, if someone posted pics of MY niece, taped to a table, or calling her a Hotard, its safe to say I'd be making future posts from inside a jail cell...</p></p>

        <p><p>Even if there was a bruise on her arm (maybe from falling off her bike, getting thumped at school, falling over in gym etc.) that doesn't mean that the only possible explanation is child abuse.</p>
<p>There's just conjecture here with no actual evidence of abuse. If the pics do exist someone should pass them to law enforcement. If not this looks like a witch hunt.</p>
<p>Dark marks under eyes are much more likely to mean someone is tired.
Could chicken lovers also mean that people like to eat chicken? It can't be that every time this phrase is used it HAS to refer to a fairly obscure slang term.</p>
<p>I do agree that the hotard comment seems to be in bad taste, but even that isn't evidence of abuse. Maybe it's just one of the billions of crappy comments posted every day on the internet.</p>
<p>I'm still not seeing any evidence of abuse, just people saying "Here's a thing that could mean 1 of a thousand things but I'm saying it HAS to mean something really bad".</p>
<p>Surely for all the hype around this there's a little more to go on than that?</p></p>

        <p><p>It's also interesting to see that simply asking questions here has caused my post to be labelled 'misleading'...</p>
<p>I'm not leading anyone anywhere, nor am I telling anyone what to think. I'm asking questions and getting unsatisfactory answers.</p>
<p>If asking for proof is labelled misleading then this sub isn't looking for what many people would call justice, nor is it interested in freedom of speech. We can do better than this and we should demand better than this from anyone who makes claims to truth in their reporting and their investigations.</p></p>
