    Any way to get teachers involved?
   </strong>
   <p>

   <p>
    The girl from that video that appeared to be from the late 80s or early 90s (sorry I can bring myself to rewatch to get more specifics ðŸ˜“) said that she was still going to school throughout all of hay horrendous stuff. She thought it was "normal" so never said anything.
   </p>
   <p>
    I wonder if there would be a way for teachers/ school counselor etc to reach out to the students to see if any of them would come forward.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unfortunately, they have probably seen what happens to those who doðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“. At best are not believed. There would have to be a trusted task force or something to help any child that does come forward.

    Related thought- what about any psychologists or psychiatrists that have worked with patients and maybe didn't believe that what their clients were describing was literal and real.
   </p>
   <p>
    Or clergy that have counseled people coming from this and thought they were just dealing with an internal, spiritual battle.
   </p>
   <p>
    We are going to need survivors to come forward to fill in the blanks.How do we find them and how do we make sure they're taken seriously?

    Well, by law teachers are required to report anything suspicious or pointing to abuse. They can be fired and face charges if they don't report it.
   </p>
   <p>
    But the teacher can't press issues like this without reason. Honestly if I started asking students if they ever were made to do xyz I'd be fired and blacklisted from ever teaching lmao
