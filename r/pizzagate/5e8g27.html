   <strong>
    So I'm thinking about taking a trip into the dark web....
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I know it's ill advised, and things I may find could place me in a very hot seat. It's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it.
   </p>
   <p>
    I feel like we need a dark horse to step in and try to gather actual intel about some of these organizations. Given that I have a source that can safely link me into these darkweb forums, I'm willing to give it a shot.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm sure the mods will be all over this post, and commenters will mention this accounts short history. All I can say is that I hope some read the legitimacy in my words and can offer some solid advice/leads as far as what to do with the information once we have it.
   </p>
   <p>
    I want this to go to the proper authorities. I happen to be in a close proximity to the area in which they've recently had an increased FBI presence on the matter, but I'm just not sure who can be trusted.
   </p>
   <p>
    Although I'm sure this post will receive plenty of judgment, I won't be giving any back. PLUR. ‚úåÔ∏èÔ∏è

    I was actually thinking about the dark web a lot today, and I'm starting to wonder if the govt played a much bigger role in its operations than previously thought.  Especially with things like the shut down of the Silk Road - is it possible that the Silk Road operation got cut once the traffic of NORMAL citizens onto the site got to be too much and threatened the operation?  Perhaps it was really intended for elitist use.  Maybe that dude, Ross Ulbricht knew some things.  They gave him a LIFE sentence.  But the way that they caught him seemed a little too sketchy.  Plus, i think there were some FBI agents who were actually accused of being involved in it!
   </p>
   <p>
    And then I recall that there was that other website that i think got infiltrated and shut down, Violent Desires or something like that.  Really creepy fucked up shit to read about.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is probably something valuable to be learned from the deep web, but goodluck finding it lol

     They gave him a life sentence because he was putting hits out on people. It wasn't some "government was upset he was raking in cash" he was literally trying to kill people lol.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those FBI agents got tossed into prison as well.

      I know that.  Thats how it was reported - but there could always be more to it than that, no?  We didn't get to where we are by taking everything at face value

        Lol dude.  People are uncovering thousands of CP pages that are concealed on twitter right now, a vanilla social media site; people surrounding the CF have been "disappeared" or murdered.  Its really not crazy to think that some stories have more to them than appear.  Already determined in the past year that you cant count on shit that the media tells us

    Just be careful. Follow all safety precautions (keep your browser up to date and turn Javascript off) and try not to do anything illegal for your own safety. There are a few directory sites, or at least there were years ago when I used to frequent the hacking forums, that you can use to get started.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is also the onions subreddit, which will likely have some relevant  links for you to look through.
   </p>
   <p>
    Be safe, and don't do anything stupid.

      Given that you have a source that can safely link you into darkweb forums, what are you looking for the Internet's approval for?

      Oh, trying to bate newbies into doing something really stupid.

       The problem with people like you assuming "newbies" intentions is that it prevents further work from being done. Not everyone has been in this from the beginning. Not everyone with programming and IT knowledge has spent their time on the dark web or in vigilante justice for that matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       And aside from all of that, neither of us have ANY experience in reporting this shit to the appropriate authorities, which if you reread my post, you will see is what I am actually asking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks though, for your almighty wisdom and guidance üôå

         the problem with people like you is your intentionally trying to lure people into a sticky situation, for whatever reason. 
You have no place here, your "investigation" into the dark web has no bearings and is just stuipid. It has no place here. dum dum

            the point that I'm trying to make is that your suggestion is irresponsible. you don't need the Internets approval to be a jack-ass, and i assume everybody is a guy online unless proven otherwise.
           </p>
           <p>
            Judging by your comment;
 "I think the key is knowing where to look. I've already gone down one rabbit hole, so why not head further into the next üëÄ"
           </p>
           <p>
            you're here to provoke people to do something stupid and I will keep explaining how you're wrong as long as you like me to

             Way to look too far into something and assume meaning from it... the problem with 90% of posts on here. I was never seeking approval.
            </p>
            <p>
             Please keep explaining. I'm waiting for your points to prove some validity. Because you've yet to address the point I originally mentioned. Where to report the shit.
            </p>
            <p>
             But you're such a good internet crusader, protecting the sub and all üëèüëèüëè round of applause for you!!!
            </p>
            <p>
             Like I said ORIGINALLY judge it all you'd like. The truth speaks for itself.
