        <strong>How is the stickied Tavistock post relevant to our sub?</strong>

        <p><p>Apparently Tavistock deals in manipulation of human consciousness

Just read the comments and links provided in the original.
How it relates? This ongoing childabuse is part of it, including us thinking it can't  be and thinking we can't stop it. There is way more to it so, but this for starters. 
Why such a sad username?</p></p>

        <p><p>Remember as a kid when school when we're taught that the one food EVERYONE loves is pizza? The people running these pedophile fronts are all connected to Tavistock's mass manipulation of consciousness.</p></p>
