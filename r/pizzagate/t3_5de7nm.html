        <strong>Elizabeth Bagley Could Have Alot To Do With The Portugal Connection!!! Please Read!!!</strong>
        <p><p>This has to be worth looking into. Bagley from 1994 to 1997, served as the U.S. Ambassador to Portugal. She was one of the biggest donors to the Clinton Campaign during the election. Bagley is a member of the Board of Directors of the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (ICMEC). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Frawley_Bagley">Wikipedia Link</a></p></p>

        <p><p>paedophiles are attracted to organisations combatting child exploitation &amp; abuse like pyromanes are attracted to the fire departments. 
Means, motive, opportunity and close association of the Podesta social circle makes it definitely an interesting lead. No proof yet of whatsoever, but we have to shake trees to let the rotten fruits fall</p></p>
