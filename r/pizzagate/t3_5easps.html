        <strong>Researcher Help Needed: The Heather and Tony Podesta Collection</strong>
        <p><p>Their collection (detailed in the Washington Post article to include nude teen photographs) was called "The Heather and Tony Podesta Collection."   </p>
<p>Here's an example of what you can find:   </p>
<p>https://nmwa.org/press-room/press-releases/partners-gifts-heather-and-tony-podesta-collection-0</p>
<p>"Eva II, a digitally manipulated photograph by Dutch artist Margi Geerlinks (b. 1970), presents an image of a young woman with a large red protrusion at the bottom of her mouth. She appears to be a contemporary Eve eating the forbidden apple. Her body is curved like that of a serpent. "</p>
<p>You can Google the image.   (Warning: Disturbing!)</p>
<p>All of their art has been on loan to museums.   Could create a catalog of the pedo-related material from that.   </p></p>

        <p><p>That's disturbing.  Also fits into the cannibalistic Spirit Cooking images (cakes made to look like human bodies).</p></p>

        <p><p>"Hellen van Meene (Dutch, b. 1972) photographs individual girls acting out scenarios that she suggests. While some seem to fit into the conventional trope of the girly girl, others are more androgynous."</p>
<p>Google the above photography.   Lots of 'pizza' girl photos, most SFW.</p></p>

        <p><p>Inner Piece: Works from the Heather and Tony Podesta Collection
September 3-December 14
Classic paintings, dreamy films, flamenco dresses, and raw photographs all punctuate inner peace but do they capture or elude an artistâ€™s inner peace or just part of it? Inner Piece features multiple works by groundbreaking contemporary artists from the Heather and Tony Podesta Collection. The exhibition brings together artists rarely if ever shown in Washington, D.C., including Pilar Albarracin, Clare Langan, Laurel Nakadate, and Julie Roberts.</p>
