        <strong>SHOCKING - Children Testimonies</strong>
        <p><p>Very shocking video of two kids speaking about all this.
Covers the raping, sacrifices, blood drinking...</p>

<p>Unrelated, but related. A must see, IMO.</p>
<p>"Years later, while assigned to the Chicago division, I was trained by the Behavioral Science Unit in the fledgling art and science of criminal profiling, that enlightened me to the very darkest side of human nature, including serial rape, serial murder, pedophilia and crimes against children, ritualistic murder, and sexual fetishes so powerful that the beholder had no problem kidnapping (and sometimes harming) an innocent person to live out their fantasy."</p>
