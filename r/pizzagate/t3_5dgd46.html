<strong>Hillary's first public appearance since the election... AT THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND GALA.</strong>
<p><p>Fake media op to make her appear as if she cares about children. LOL... in one of the photos, you can see the full Children's Defense Fund banner behind her on the stage with a quote that says "Dear Lord, be good to me. The sea is so wide and my boat is so small". What a convenient quote for her to stand in front of considering all that the world is discovering, eh? She is trying to come across as a "God loving woman" and as if she cares about children SO MUCH. In my opinion, her overcompensating for what she knows we are discovering with Pizzagate makes her appear even more guilty. I hate how she is encouraging her supporters to "keep fighting" too. What an evil bitch.</p>
<p>Full article with photos <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3944234/Hillary-hiding-Clinton-says-wasn-t-easiest-thing-children-s-gala-disappointing-defeat-considered-never-leaving-house-again.html?ito=social-twitter_dailymailus">here</a>. By the way, one of those photos looks like the inside of her mouth was photoshopped out (Google Hillary Clinton's tongue to see why I point that out).</p></p>

<p><p>If you want to control the business of child traffic you better control the organisations working on child care first. I am not saying that clintons are 100% guilty but you know there is a solid possibility. So this does make sense when you think of it that way. </p>
<p>And also check: How CIA is claimed to control the orphanages in war zones. </p></p>

<p><p>I'm no fan of the clintons and hope they go down (along w/ others) if this whole things turns out to be true...(and unfortunately its looking like we're ARE on to something) BUT...I do know that this appearance was scheduled weeks ago prior to the Podesta coded email leaks that started this whole and the FBI re-opening the investigation. She planned to make this one of her 1st appearances as potus...(least that didn't happen, then you know this story would never see the mainstream light of day...still may not)</p></p>
