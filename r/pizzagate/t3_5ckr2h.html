        <p><p>Big ol' silvery thing in the back? Pretty tall but I guess plenty of room to move? Could also be a storage situation with easy view and access with a lock on it or something.</p>
<p>Not that that last part helps at all. Wow.</p></p>

<p>Edit, it might be worth looking into the actors listed in this video. </p></p>

        <p><p>It's the same cage or same style cage but in a different location. Look at 4:21, you can clearly see the wall it's up against. Whereas the Instagram photo has it looking free standing and not in an enclosed space.</p></p>

        <p><p>Do they ever have cage dancers? I know they get some weird indie shit there.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not sure yet on the actors themselves. There may be links but it's probably tenuous since they were just likely just paid to be a part of this. I'd look more at the name mentioned for location. That person helps decide where the band goes and chose Comet for some reason. Even if there's no link and just coincidental, the video gives more information about the "underground" area of the building.</p></p>

        <p><p>Watching the whole video I see some clear similarities with the heavy breathing stuff, so yeah the people behind it are probably more interesting. </p>
<p>The costume designers name stood out for me, I however couldn't manage to find the one of many with same name.</p>
<p>And regarding the actors I meant more in a where are they now, see it they have social media accounts or similar.</p></p>

        <p><p>True, the heavy breathing stuff has similarities. The costume designers name sounds familiar but it's such a common name it might be hard to do much without putting a face to it. Thanks for clarifying the actors, they definitely have to be using social media but I'm not convinced enough yet to dig down this hole on my own. Working on some other suspicious links outside of this. </p></p>
