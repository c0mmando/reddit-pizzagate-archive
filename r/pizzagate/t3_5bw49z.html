        <p><p>I think risotto references are legit. He is a chef. It doesn't take cheffing to make pizza though.</p></p>

        <p><p>"It's amazing how much you can do with a quality risotto!"</p>
<p>Um, isn't a risotto a finished dish? How much you can do? Not how much will pair with, how many uses there are... how much you can do with...</p></p>

        <p><p>Coincidentally, I like risotto and there are a lot of options, including black walnut risotto as he mentions in another email with even creepier context. </p>
<p>There's risotto recipes with all sorts of vegetables (squash, pumpkin), risotto pilota, which includes some sort of meat, another type with fish and of course all the different mushroom-based dishes which have a full spectrum of variety in themselves. </p>
<p>He's definitely a kid fucker, but he might just like to make a good risotto too. One key might be that someone making advanced risotto isn't wasting any time making or eating cheese pizza.</p></p>

        <p><p>As in, mentions of Risotto mean it will be a non-cheese pizza event? that would make sense.</p></p>

        <p><p>That's my theory. If it's risotto, he's probably cooking dinner.</p></p>
