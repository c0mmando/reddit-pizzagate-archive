        <p><p>Those guys made a few mistakes.</p>
<ul>
<li>posting on twitter "that's it, i'm going to ping pong pizza tonight"</li>
<li>updating twitter and streaming even before entering the pizza joint</li>
<li>talking about pizzagate on the live stream</li>
<li>never wondering if ANYONE of the pizzagate gang is watching too and alert the place, maybe even someone inside the joint.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next time:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wear multiple hidden cams, for every person going inside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stream the recording to some private secured server, where friends have access on too (in case being 
cought/jailed/killed)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post the recordings public after you left the joint.</p>
</li>
</ul></p>

        <p><p>These are the Periscope videos uploaded to YouTube.</p>
<p>-Dinner at Comet Pizza. PIZZAGATE 1/3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaHl7BL9zhU</p>
<p>-Kicked out of Comet Pizza + Visit to Besta. PIZZAGATE 2/3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2aSK4fKIbU</p>
<p>-Besta Pizza Recap PIZZAGATE 3/3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UROJCpxpBM4</p>
<p>Now this is all speculation concerning camera's pointing towards the back in Besta and children going in and out of backroom in Comet given the shitty video.
I made this merely as a visual for myself and others to get a better understanding on what the man in the Periscope video was trying to illustrate when explaining his encounter.</p></p>

        <p><p>Name another pizza place in the country that's equally as weird and suspicious as this one with no pedo connections and we'll stop asking questions. </p></p>

<p>Never seen a pizza place with as fucked up of an instagram as this one. They immediately deleted it AFTER the fact that we found out about it. Sure, I get if they deleted it earlier to save face, but they've kept it all on there for years.  </p>
<p>Remember, these rumors have been flying around for years by top secret service agents and government officials. We also know Dennis Herst, former speaker of the house and friend of the Podestas got caught and convicted of pedophilia. </p></p>
