        <strong>Thought experiment for historical context: "Faggot" was originally a slur for Fascists, who used child rape and torture in Roman times as their command and control structure.</strong>
        <p><p>(Note: There is much speculation involved here, but it appears to ring true.)</p>
<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2lrdqa/til_the_words_fascist_and_faggot_both_derive_from/">Both "faggot" and "fascist" derive from the Latin root Fasces.</a> Faggot refers to the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fasces&amp;safe=off&amp;biw=1212&amp;bih=553&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch">bundle of sticks used as a symbol of fascism</a>. When people realized the child abuse inherent in the system, it became a slur for the fascists themselves.</p>
<p>Child rape was no more acceptable in ancient Rome than it is now. This was not a normal relationship in another culture, as it's presented today. When the fascists were caught raping children, they were burned. Stories of these executions have been replaced by stories of burning non-pedophile homosexuals in order to demonize the practice and bury the past.</p>
<p>Similarly, the term "faggot" has since been linguistically morphed into a pejorative for non-pedophile homosexuals, in an effort to obfuscate <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/12/20/very-very-bad-things/">the satanic command/control structure of child rape and torture</a> that's still in place by the global fascists today.</p>
<p>Fascists are hiding behind homosexuals just as Khazarians hide behind the Jews, using them as human shields to absorb blame and deflect suspicion and as political tools where useful.</p>
<p>One last thought... People in a victim mindset, those who have endured trauma, are easy to manipulate. MKULTRA writ large.</p></p>

        <p><p>Fucking hell, everything we've ever learned is a reverse-smokescreen for these pedophiles. Guess the plan is to demonize everything to create a neutered/complacent population while they go around doing sick shit in the midst of the chaos.</p></p>

        <p><p>wow. thats a deep connection. yes traces to ancient rome and much beyond.  the apostate babylon church built on this sort of faggot pedo stuff ancient roman cults connection.  Both powers wrestled over the Babylon church.  Ill try and find this stuff. there was something about early popes having a bathing pool in the gardens of the vatican for this exact type of faggotry.  Though it was a practice that pre dated the Vatican.</p></p>

        <p><p>lets go crazy. Its a monstrous 7 headed hydra beast using high technology to hide its tracks using NLP techniques in the same way today as in the Talmud. placed in time in a combined effort to displace ancient Israel. The Ta-all-mud is, ridiculously enough - also a product of tavistock institute nazi occult influenced military industrial complex time machine connection talmud placed by "jew" christians in multpronged attack to destroy judaism while "christian" jews fought to destroy christians and so on. </p></p>

        <p><p>You know another odd thing? People remember a "Satanic panic" from the 80's and inquiry into the occult is now seen as on par with witch-burning and notorious cases like the West Memphis Three (3 boys who may have been falsely accused of a Satanic ritual, and the trial got made into a documentary). I'd even say the term "witch-burning" is suspect at this point. </p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised that nearly all of our knowledge is due to multiple psyops. </p></p>
