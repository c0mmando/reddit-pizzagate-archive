        <p><p>That's the 64,000 dollar question.  There are several articles on it.</p>

<p>Also BBC and other Brit sources.  Either they were involved (debt, played with the group, etc.) or they were targeted.  I saw some citationless reference to an anon FBI source who "confirmed" that Podesta the Molesta was in Portugal, in that town, at the same time.  Seems way too coincidental for me.</p></p>

        <p><p>This makes me think the McCanns pimped her out for whatever purpose (they have a connection to the elite) and wanted to give the impression to the public that they cared </p></p>
