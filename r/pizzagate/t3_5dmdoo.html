        <p><p>They're already here.  u/tardbuster is a self-professed "friend" of theirs that is seeking to normalize the content of their videos.  Be wary that this is a community of people that are willing to look the other way when it comes to child abuse.  They have created a disgusting environment under the guise that it is artsy, progressive, and "hip".  They then attempt to defend themselves by focusing on the racist, or homophobic outsiders on the fringes of this investigation being morons and posting racist and homophobic shit on their social media accounts.  </p>
<p>Newsflash Amanda Kleinman, I am Jewish too.  I am not attacking you because you are Jewish, I am attacking you because you have repeatedly posted disturbing content on PUBLIC social media profiles and youtube and I am concerned that it is not appropriate for the "all ages" crowd you say you cater to.  </p>
<p>I want to repeat something I have said a thousand times (it feels like on this website).  This is not a religious, political, or personal investigation.  This is an investigation that is solely seeking to prevent the abuse of children.  There is a mountain of (circumstantial) evidence that is obviously resonating in the court of public opinion.  You know why? Because people care about kids' safety!  I urge everyone to leave the religious, conspiratorial, and political shit out of this.  Might there be some tie-backs to this shit, maybe, but when you focus on that, you detract from the purpose of this investigation; we want to prevent the abuse of children, nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>edit: some punctuation, removed word <em>literally</em> because I am not a teenage girl </p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks for pointing out the Jewish thing!  I have been trying to figure out what the hell Alefantis and Kleinman were talking about when referencing theorists as racist, but the Jewish angle makes sense.  1 mystery down for me, 10,000 to go</p></p>

        <p><p>Anne Frank was killed even though she was not religious, so Jews do have a history of being persecuted for their heritage. But all of this is besides the point here. Amanda Kleinman being looked into has nothing to do with being Jewish. If it was about that, then why not accuse other Jews like Sarah Silverman or Adam Sandler? Because they're not the ones who laughed off the idea of children being a viable preference. Kleinman did that. She's suspicious because of her actions, not because of who she is. Stop trying to derail the investigation.</p></p>

        <p><p>The very first harassing posts and threats on Amanda's youtube were explicitly anti-Semitic. I don't know about Alefantis, but many people conflate homosexuality and pedophilia.</p></p>

        <p><p>As has been explained to you several times, her post was in response to the rash of insults and threats she got on her videos, many of which -- including the earliest -- were explicitly anti-Semitic. Many of the posts on the original 4chan threads where this stuff got started were also explicitly bigoted. </p>
<p>Why would the fact that some self-described non-bigots later got onboard change anything?</p></p>

        <p><p>You realize that no one is going to buy your "anti-Semitic!!!!!!" bullshit right? Those are smear words used to discredit people that are trying to tell the truth. You don't get to just throw those words at people and expect them to do their magic anymore. That's not how this works motherfucker. </p>
<p>Your friends have been exposed for being disgusting pedophiles. If you're taking up with them then you're complicit and probably implicated in it as well. Calling people anti-Semitic is not going to work. No one here is gonna play your fancy smear word games. You don't get to hide from being accused of doing inappropriate things with children by saying "anti-Semite"</p>
<p>Try something else and I'll be sure to inform you why that's not going to work either.</p></p>

        <p><p>Ugh that's disgusting don't even get me started on those people or that term. It's tossed around so loosely and so often that it's lost its meaning. Anti-Semitic is now just a term used to describe people that Jews don't like. <em>To find out who has control, look to who you're not allowed to criticize</em>, as the saying goes.</p></p>

        <p><p>Just like "Islamophobe", "racist, "homophobe" and "xenophobe", these adjectives are near meaningless because they're lobbed at innocents at the drop of the hat, even when no hate is being expressed. People are numb to this PC bullshit, because of idiots like the feminists who cry rape and assault at every turn, just for looking at them funny. </p></p>

        <p><p>It is a fact that the harassment and threats Amanda received, that prompted her to write that Facebook post, came from the bigoted cesspool of 4chan and in large part was EXPLICITLY anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>Again, that's what led to her post, and that's what she referred to in that post. For someone attempting to "investigate" something, you are terrible at seeing the evidence right in front of you.</p></p>

        <p><p>The evidence right in front of me is that we now have some fool pretending to be an actual fan of this awful music coming in here and playing damage control for pedophiles. "Anti-Semitic" is not going to work anymore. This age of political correctness is over. No one should have to censor themselves, especially when talking to pedophiles. Every name "Amanda" has been called is probably well deserved. If you're gonna fuck children, you deserve to be called the worst things in the book and crying "anti-Semitic!!!" is not going to save her.</p></p>

        <p><p>4chan is racist and bigoted about everything.  Look around that place.  It is what they do.  It was why they loved Trump so much.  </p>
<p>You can try to make this political, you can try to make it about free speech, but people were disturbed by her musical and comedic allusions to pedophilia and child abuse and have every right to express their displeasure.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, 4chan, where the theory originated and where the harassment originally came from, is "racist and bigoted". So I find it hilarious that when Amanda posted about the harassment coming from bigots, you act outraged.</p></p>

        <p><p>Because focusing on a fringe-right message board is just a lazy attempt to deflect people away from the root of the actual concerns.  A pizza place that is supposed to appeal to all ages should not (this is a fucking opinion) have blatant references to child exploitation.  </p>
<p>It annoys/outrages me (albeit less than child abuse) that many anons in the 4chan sit their pumping each other up for being smarter than everyone while using the n-word, being anti-semetic, sexist, and all of the bigoted bullshit they do behind their computer screens.  If I wanted to attack Anonymous (the hacker collective) credibility I don't point out that, "well 4-chan is racist so, the government is not spying on us" just because they use it to communicate.  Much like your group of friends, you don't have to all be pedophiles for some of you to be bad eggs.  </p>
<p>You are attacking individuals, not the message, the goal, or the concerns and we have every right to be incredulous, just like you do.  </p></p>

        <p><p>How would they have any idea she was Jewish? She was wearing a mask,wig, and disguised her voice. </p>
<p>Stop hiding behind Amanda being Jewish &amp; Alefantis being gay. No one cares. Your deflections won't work anymore. We have tons of footage of Amanda talking about Pedofilia &amp; of Jimmy making gross comments about babies. </p>
<p>That's what we care about &amp; that's why people won't let this go. It's obvious you or someone close to Amanda started writing anti-sematic to take away attention from your pedofilia. </p>
<p>It won't work, you idiots left too many clues behind</p></p>

<p>No -- you have one joke about Jared from Subway (perhaps you should investigate how many comedians made off-color Jared jokes during that news story), and one video where she is repulsed by a guy because what he said sounded like something a "gross" pedophile might say. That's it. Those are literally the only two examples you have of Amanda talking about pedophilia whatsoever.</p>

        <p><p>No one knew it was "Kleinman" at first, we only knew her as "majestic ape". And even if someone did comment something ant-Semitic, it doesn't take any of the gross stuff you or your friends did/said. &amp; it's obvious you are the ones leaving the anti-semite or anti-gay comments to try to deflect, but that won't work on the internet Amanda, people won't forget about all the gross stuff you posted. It's literally a click a way. </p>
<p>&amp; it's not just 1 joke, it was a long joke with multiple pedo references, which Amanda brought up out of no where. but hey, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>we all have our preferences right?</p>

<p>&amp; Jimmy didn't make dead  baby jokes, he made many pedo comments about the same children over and over. </p>

<p>Maybe if you didn't try to deflect with false accusations of homophobia/anti-semitism, we would believe you were just making a really unfunny joke. We just want want to know why your whole community thinks endangering and sexualizing children is funny, because we sure don't, and we will keep asking until you give us a reasonable answer.</p></p>

        <p><p>Why can't you cite all these supposed pedo things she talked about if, as you claim, it's more than the two I explained: A joke about Subway Jared, and a joke about a guy being so "gross" he must be a pedo?</p></p>

        <p><p>Straw man, you seem to have forgot when she talked about euthanizing a child upon birth.  Do you really wonder why that might raise some fucking eyebrows?  Rhetorical, I know you don't it's super cool, fun art. </p></p>

        <p><p>Strawman? I've already told you to please stop using the words when you don't know what they mean.</p>
<p>People keep saying she said many pedo references, so why are you bringing up killing a baby? What does that have to do with pedophilia?</p>
<p>Stop trying to deflect. Again, I've explained the only two references to pedophilia I've heard Amanda make: One was a joke about Jared because at the time Heavy Breathing were playing in a bar beneath a Subway; the other was being repulsed by a male character and calling him "gross" because he seemed like a pedophile.</p>
<p>Either cite these other times she referenced/"promoted" pedophilia or stop pretending she made dozens of such jokes.</p></p>

        <p><p>When you focus on the Jared joke no one really gives a shit about (except maybe the fact that she says everyone has preferences), while leaving out the child murder joke, you have created a straw man.  </p>
<p>Jokes about Jared are a dime a dozen and we hear them from everywhere; you know this is not what we are focused on.</p>
<p>It is a simple concept, and someone as wise as you should be able to handle it.</p></p>

        <p><p>You'r really trying hard to defend these peoples names. My assumption is you are a close friend (ie., A part of their gross circle) or you would like to be closer to their circle(s). </p>
<p>Do you really think you'r going to clarify and un-sully their names, on the internet, with the number of correlating  and concerning facts people have attained? Plus with the all the potential conflicts of interest(s) being presented by redditors, the public is doing their own investigation, based on public records., Sadly your friend(s) got correlated into this because of the nature of the things they like to endorse or joke about. They are also uncomfortably close with people involved in a case that is overwhelmingly screaming "pedophile ring". </p></p>

        <p><p>This might shock you but the world doesn't revolve around you and this subreddit. Everyone doesn't owe it to you to make sure they don't accidentally lump you in with the bigoted nutjobs whose theory you have co-opted. You're not at risk of losing your job if this subreddit gets unfairly grouped with 4chan, whereas Amanda could potentially be as risk of losing her job if her work starts getting calls or emails about this jew bitch pedo.</p></p>

        <p><p>We should feel bad that people found her public social media when investigating child abuse and found that she was ostensibly advocating murdering kids to an audience who laughed about it, and now are pointing other concerned citizens to this trash she posted on the web?  </p>
<p><strong>The people (bigots) contacting her work should be punished by slander, libel, and harassment laws.</strong> </p>
<p>But don't think for a second anyone feels bad about calling attention to her poor taste in "art".  If I was interested in self preservation I would not make jokes about killing or abusing children at an "all ages" venue, but alas she did and it just happened to coincide with legitimate concerns of abuse of power by powerful people in Washington who happen to frequent similar establishments.  It sucks if she has nothing to do with child abuse, but she is going to be inherently linked to it because of things she said publicly.</p></p>

        <p><p>When you fail to provide "verifiable proof" that you're not a pedo, if an army of trolls started following you from here to Facebook to Youtube and telling you what a sick pedo you are and how your days are numbered, should anyone feel bad?</p>
<p>I doubt Amanda could care less if you guys think she's sick and hate what she does, as long as you don't harass and threaten her over it.</p></p>

        <p><p>The difference is I am not in youtube videos talking about the shit dickweed.  </p>
<p>I work for a living.  I have a wife and a daughter, and two dogs.  I am concerned for their safety and want to provide what few skills I have to make sure child abuse is not occurring at the highest levels of this country.</p></p>

        <p><p>As someone who is in the LGBT community, I don't associate homosexuality with pedophilia at all. The two things are absolutely, totally separate.</p>
<p>I don't know why those comments were anti-Semitic except to paint this as a racist conspiracy. None of us have posted anti-Semitic material to this subreddit. It's very possible that users set out to post these comments on purpose in order to weaken the image of the community/make people dismiss the evidence entirely.</p></p>

        <p><p>yup, I'm pretty sure I've come up against some of their 'friends', basically they're pushing the narrative, 'if you can't prove nothing, then nothing happen' and that we should all calm down cause evil 4chan is keking us to death. </p></p>

        <p><p>If you were running a global child trafficking/exploitation ring would you hide the evidence in plain sight?  No, obviously.  We have latched on to the only sources of information that are easily accessible:</p>
<p>1.) creepy Podesta emails thanks to wikileaks
2.) social media of smaller fish that run in the same circles</p>
<p>Anyone who expected to have definitive proof of the whole grand conspiracy after a few weeks is obtuse... The fact that there are this many connections between these people with similar, despicable interest is what keeps motivating people to dig deeper.  The only people who parrot this, "no concrete evidence" line are too lazy to read the vast web of interconnected people in positions of power related to this through emails, social media or both, or they are are simply disinformation agents.  </p>
<p>Public opinion does not need to be based on concrete evidence anyway.  If your idea of entertainment is to joke about hurting children, expect to catch some flack for it.</p></p>

        <p><p>That's essentially what all the summary posts are.  People come here shilling, ignore 99% of what people have collected, and thus the whole investigation is stupid.  It is like they forgot the entire BBC, and government UK was just found to be complicit in widespread child abuse.  The specifics of this may be surprising, but if you look at the history of child abuse among powerful people, the writing was on the wall for America too.  I do not know if this is what Trump meant, by "draining the swamp", but I really hope this is a component of it.  I am concerned that the NYPD was silenced, they obviously had access to very damning evidence.</p></p>

        <p><p>You missed the entire point of the post.  I said their was no concrete evidence, just a mountain of coincidences.  Are you hoping people skip past my post and just read the parts that you cherry-pick and respond to?  </p>
<p>You keep leaving out the wider scope of the investigation and bring it back to your "art".  You will not find adults in the real world, outside of your little sphere of artists, and the child abusers you cater to, who appreciate your "art".  </p>
<p>Real adults support families, businesses, and contribute back to society.  What do you and your friends contribute?  Shitty art that appeals to no one except those that think child abuse is funny or acceptable.  I don't know what you think you have accomplished by coming to reddit, but I thank you for doing so -- it has been eye-opening.  </p>
<p>On a serious note, I am sorry if you were abused as a child, and I want you to know there are resources to get help.  I hope that when the dust has settled, you seek help if you need it.  I also hope you see we are trying to shed light on this issue, so that others do not suffer the same fate.</p></p>

        <p><p>Of course she works with kids...  </p>
<p>I, personally, have provided opportunities that have employed hundreds of Americans so they can support their families.  </p>
<p>I feel very uneasy that someone who talks about child abuse in such a casual manner, for a comedy routine, is working with children -- how can you not see that that would make people raise their eyebrows?</p></p>

        <p><p>I mean... you can always just upvote the responses to his posts so people still see his responses if they choose.  </p>
<p>He is being a bit unreasonable, every argument is he has made is illogical, i.e. Seth Rogan made a bad joke once.  Well guess what, Setho Rogan's entire shtick is not revolving around child abuse.  </p>
<p>The only reasonable thing he has said is that they are innocent until proven guilty, and that they have the right to make whatever art they want (at least that is what I think he is trying to say).  </p>
<p>However, that does not mean they are innocent in the court of public opinion or that people can't be creeped out and ask questions.  </p></p>

<p>The hilarious part is that you have no reason to believe any children have been abused. </p>
<p>Imagine if you came across a death metal band and all their flyers had horrific images of violence and murder. Their videos did too. So did their website.Then you looked at the clubs they played at and saw flyers with the same imagery. Same for the other bands they played with. </p>
<p>Oh no we have to stop these murderers! Let's go to the police! "Uh, son, usually before we investigate a crime we start by being aware that a crime has been committed...do you have any reason to believe anyone has been murdered?"</p></p>

        <p><p>u/tardbuster, you have repeatedly normalized and or rationalized instances of disgusting references to the murder, and abuse of children.  To what end?  Why are you upset that people are worried about kids who are subjected to your type of ilk?  People are allowed to be over protective of their children.  Why are you here?  If there was truly no reason for concern, would you need to defend them?</p>
<p>Outside of their obscene references, their music sucks (opinion I know).  I listen to hardcore music.  It gets me pumped up.  My music, and comedy does not rely on obscene references to child abuse.</p>
<p>I want to destroy you and anyone who seeks to downplay, or normalize this behavior.  The exploitation of children is a real problem and that you would come here to dissuade people from combating it, shows how far gone your morality is.  </p>
<p>By all means, continue to frequent these places in a cesspool of child abuse acceptance -- we will destroy you.</p></p>

<p>I'm explaining the reason for the inclusion of specific jokes and images in this bands' videos. I thought you guys were "investigating"? You want people to go to Comet, you want people to spy on this band, etc. Well here I am, I've been to Comet many times, I've seen the band many times, but because the information I'm giving you doesn't prop up your pre-conceived notions, you are very angry. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why are you upset that people are worried about kids who are subjected to your type of ilk? People are allowed to be over protective of their children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, your kids have gone missing in or around Comet? Why didn't you say so?</p>
<p>The parents who actually go to Comet with their kids, rather than just imagine what Comet is like and look at it on Google street view and fantasize about what happens there, have NOTHING bad to say about the place. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why are you here? If there was truly no reason for concern, would you need to defend them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1) They're being harassed. 2) You guys have professed to want inside information and answers...but strangely unless that information is what you were hoping for, you react with anger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Outside of their obscene references, their music sucks (opinion I know). I listen to hardcore music. It gets me pumped up. My music, and comedy does not rely on obscene references to child abuse.</p>

<p>Congratulations!</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Ok start with Seth Rogen. Next I'll link you to about three different episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm that make jokes based on pedophilia. I guess that means Seinfeld should be included in your boycott since Larry David wrote both shows. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>child abuse acceptance </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither I nor anyone in these bands "accepts" child abuse. The point, all along, is that they have never participated in any child abuse, nor are they -- or you, if you're being honest with yourself -- aware of any child abuse having ever taken place at Comet (much less Besta) or by anyone associated with it.</p></p>

        <p><p>Deflect, deflect, deflect.  For someone who seems to think we are wasting <em>our</em> time, you have sure spent a lot of <em>your</em> time here deflecting.</p>
<p>Did you guys get together and come up with a nice bulleted list of how you were going to deflect scrutiny of the disgusting shit your friends call art?  </p>
<p>You are trying to control the narrative, "nothing to see here, I've been here many times guy."  Why the fuck would we trust a stranger, that created an account to come and defend them from the get-go?  You are not an objective skeptic, you clearly have something to lose (or gain).</p></p>

<p>Instead you deflected &amp; won't acknowledge any of the gross pedo things you said. It's obvious you're in full panic mode right now because you got caught. </p>

        <p><p>Who are you then? Why won't the band or Amanda answer our questions? The band or Comet Pong should do an AMA to clear things up, they could end pizzagate right now by just clearing up a few questions we have, if they have nothing to hide why wouldn't they want to end this?</p>
<p>It would be great publicity for them to show us they are just indeed just a pizza shop. Their super defensiveness and even accusations back at us, is something I've never seen a business do before, especially one owned by the top 50 people in D.C.</p></p>

        <p><p>Why don't you set up an IAMA with the band, James Alefantis, the owner of Bestas, an employee of any of the businesses?  Why don't you go take pictures of the restaurants and document that every assertion made about the "killroom" are patently false?  Why not provide some verifiable proof of innocence if you are so concerned with the overwhelming public opinion?  </p>
<p>Creating an account and shilling for one of the groups responsible for the seediest content we can uncover is the wrong approach.  </p>
<p><strong>LET ME SAY THIS AGAIN BECAUSE I KNOW I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE TO YOU PERSONALLY.  NO ONE ACTUALLY WANTS KIDS TO BE IN DANGER.  THE CONNECTIONS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE ON PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS HAS PEOPLE GENUINELY WORRIED FOR CHILDREN.</strong></p>
<p>If you have real evidence that there is no cause for concern other than, "well some people think its funny lol," or, "it is just art" PLEAAAAAAASE SHARE IT!</p></p>

        <p><p>"Verifiable proof of innocence"? The fact that you even made such an absurd statement shows that you have no idea how the world, or logic, or rational thought, work.</p>
<p>Tell you what, you provide me with verifiable proof that you're not a pedophile, and I'll return the favor.</p>
<p>The fact that you're talking about pictures of the restaurant just shows how clueless you are. Anyone can go in there anytime. Plenty of people have weighed in on these threads on various forums who have been there. You don't care what they say. You can find literally not one person, one parent, one kid, who has actually been to Comet and who has ever complained about Comet beyond maybe thinking its overpriced or they didn't like their pizza. Yet you have bizarrely concluded that it's incumbent on them to (somehow) prove their innocence.</p>
<p>Besta Pizza are pedos, why else would they have a logo that looks like a pedo symbol?

        <p><p>This isn't a court dip shit, this is public sentiment and opinion.  I am not going to call people I don't know and ask them questions, that is harassment.  We are accumulating as much information as we can.  Pretending that child abuse does not occur, because no one has found out about it is just silly.  </p>
<p>And to give you some insight to me personally... I am sitting at fucking work, watching hard working Americans, finish construction on a $50M manufacturing facility I designed and managed from start to finish.  I happen to have the time to shit all over your posts, because it is going so well.  You think you're a superior intellectual?  Rational thought, logic... what the fuck do you do for a living besides shilling for a shit band?  Are you a law man?  An ambulance chaser?  Do you teach logic and critical thinking at GW?</p>
<p>update:  I think he must just be some deviant "artist"</p></p>

        <p><p>Wait, so where's the verifiable proof that you're not a pedophile?</p>
<p>Don't worry about what I do for a living. It's none of your business, obviously.</p>
<p>Neither Amanda nor anyone cares if you spend three straight years writing up 10,000 pages of Pizzagate theories and "evidence". It only becomes a problem when people and businesses are harassed and threatened. If you're not one of those doing that, then don't worry about it.</p></p>

        <p><p>Surprise, I guess? Like...yes. I told you, I have read <em>all</em> of the supposed evidence here, and have been pouring over it.</p>
<p>I'm all for the taking down of pedophile rings. Take them <em>all</em> down. But if you want to do that, you guys need to:
1) investigate all explanations and options. No one here is doing that, you guys are just the worst at research.</p>
<p>2) Get your facts straight. The amount of people posting factually incorrect stuff in this sub is insane.</p></p>

        <p><p>Lets forget about Comet... that is like beating a dead horse. Do you have any leads which would help investigate elsewhere... maybe if you gave some fresh blood to sic the dogs on they would stop picking at the bones of Comet/Besta? </p>
<p>Everyone is suspicious of something... what are you suspicious of? </p></p>

        <p><p>I have never seen nor heard of any rumors whatsoever about some underground pedo ring in the DC art/music/pizza scene. Other than the usual overarching "powerful elites in the world are into pedophilia" stuff....nothing. I doubt anyone who actually hangs out in DC has. </p>
<p>I'm sure if the people here put in a similar amount of work in their own towns, they'd find all kinds of "obvious" pedo symbols and instagrams etc. Because people tend to find what they're looking for, even if they have to invent it.</p></p>

        <p><p>Your town probably is every bit as progressive and cool. Apes played Detroit many times and I'll bet most of the bands on those "horrific" flyers at Comet have also played in Detroit, and sometimes even the flyers would be the same.</p>
<p>For example here are some flyers for All Ages shows at the Magic Stick in Detroit:</p>

        <p><p>Thanks for replying calmly, there is a good amount of users here that are the stereotypical conspiracy theorist and they misrepresent the community. We aren't trying to witch hunt and harass you guys, we're just trying to find solid concrete proof that what looks to be happening is or is not. I appreciate you coming here and being transparent.</p></p>

        <p><p>What is transparent about the illogical appeal, "I have been there, nothing to see here."  What is transparent about deflecting and pointing out other entertainers have broached the subject of child exploitation?  What is transparent about rehashing the incorrect assumption that we are all alt-right conspiracy theorists?  What is transparent about creating an account with the sole purpose of dissuading anyone from joining an investigation that is centered around making sure kids aren't being abused?  </p>
<p>That is not transparent, it is all misdirection.  I am glad he is here too, but buying in to his shit defense (in your post) is not preventing a witch-hunt.  He is motivating a witch hunt by brushing off the art as normal, and assuming we should all just accept it.  </p></p>

        <p><p>That is literally the crux of your argument.  "It's art, get over it."  There are allusions to child abuse throughout her work and you know it, you are picking out pedophilia specifically, as though one is better or worse than the other, or the two aren't inherently linked.  Stop pretending that the same themes don't permeate her work.  We have seen it, the damage is done.  Stop pretending that child abuse does not exist, because no one in your circle has been caught.  I ask you again, what are you really hoping to accomplish?  Get help, man, seriously.</p></p>

        <p><p>No, it actually is. You don't like the sense of humor or taste in art/music of these people -- fantastic. </p>
<p>But you have zero, literally zero, reason to think that any child has been abused. You don't have missing kid reports from Comet's neighborhood, you don't have parents who have taken their kids to Comet saying their kids are acting weird now, you have nothing. You have no legitimate reason to think any crimes against children have taken place. Therefore how weird or distasteful or creepy you find any of these people or places is irrelevant. </p>
<p>"That guy is such a fucking shifty creep, I know he steals stuff." </p>
<p>"Well has anything been stolen?" </p>
<p>"Um..not that I know of."</p></p>

        <p><p>Apparently you are not paying close enough attention.  A huge part of this investigation is centered around the connections to organizations that work with missing children, orphanages, and other at risk youth.  You are simultaneously telling us to stop investigating, and that no evidence exists -- you see how that may motivate us?</p></p>

        <p><p>I couldn't care less if you "investigate" or not.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is that if someone with bad taste in art has some kind of "connection" to an organization that works with missing children, that is not evidence of pedophilia. It's disturbing that so many of you seem to  think it is.</p>
<p>Again, investigations typically start with the crime. You don't know of any crime having taken place. So trying to figure out who is responsible for a crime that you have no reason to believe has taken place is bizarre, to say the least.</p></p>

        <p><p>Child exploitation is a crime and it happens all the time.  No one is kicking down doors arresting people yet.  No one here would claim there is a smoking gun either.  We are concerned because as we dig, more and more evidence connects the same group of "like-minded" people, who seem to enjoy the same "art", and run in the same crowds -- and it is clear they have access to at risk youth, while simultaneously joking and sharing "art" about child exploitation.  </p></p>

        <p><p>You are very stupid.</p>
<p>Argumentum ad ignorantiam. You are saying that your proposition is true because it hasn't been proven false yet by evidence. You mean there is no video yet of someone fucking a toddler. Thank God, right?</p>
<p>Then you use ad hominem. "You could also be a pedo". Then you ad the argumentum add ignorantum. "You are a pedo, since you haven't proven me otherwise". You conclude from these fallacies that since this is the case for the majority of the population, that your buddies aren't part of this too. A good try at a straw man fallacy.</p>
<p>Go back to school and stop wanking to babies, you are loosing all your mental capability to think outside your box (your cave).</p></p>

        <p><p>I was asked to provide "verifiable proof of innocence", so I showed how absurd such a request was by asking the same of the accuser.</p>
<p>Pretty simple stuff, I'm surprised you didn't get it. And you, like the other dude, seem to somehow STILL not understand what a strawman is.</p></p>

        <p><p>Because nothing is verifiable until it's proven, so you must go down the rabit hole even if it's a fantasy. Why?</p>
<p>Because people try to hide their tracks so you must investigate. Second, once you think you have evidence, the normal thing is to contact the suspect.</p>
<p>Isin't that why suspects get called to question?</p>

        <p><p>So why does the subway of lets say... New York say:</p>
<p>"If you find any suspicious person [...] please contact the police".</p>
<p>Because typically you want to avoid a crime taking place or a future crime.</p>
<p>What you are saying is that there is the same probability that someone that collects pedo sub art has the same probability of doing a crim than your average joe that doesn't collect any of these things. </p>
<p>Wrong. Of course if you are a normal person and even if you haven't seen him actually doing the act, you will be a suspect. When the possible crime involves babies, it attracats more truth diggers. And there is something I'll agree, not every hole leads to a truth, but it's undeniable that there are pedo's and a person that colects pedo art or has any relation to these things is more inclined to doing something with them.</p>
<p>It's common cirminal prevention. Black people get pulled over more because for now, black people are the ones causing 80% of the murders in america. Whenever they get to 49% they will be pulled over less.</p>
<p>Pedo art collectors and anything in the realm is obviosuly a red flag, and if you deny this, well, you either have no idea about antifragility  processes or you have some interest in portraying this as something the average joe does.</p>
<p>Your call turd.</p></p>

        <p><p>What happened to this person? I was having a nice debate with them and they just disappeared. They said their parents poured centipedes on them locked them in a concrete box for days and gave them drugs before making them fist fight other kids. Shit was getting interesting. Now I'm just confused.</p></p>

        <p><p>100% don't care.</p>
<p>They've catastrophically compromised themselves this time; usually whispered truths can be hushed, but now there are screams from the rooftop.
Their only option should be contingency.
Fleeing, running and hiding are what they should be concentrating on now; covering evidence, which we expect, is just superfluous and indicates extreme guilt if they want to tread that path.</p>
<p>We will know soon enough, whether there is anyone with any principles left in the FBI, CIA, NSA or other.</p>
<p>Pizzagate aside; Hillary and Podesta should be jailed by now.</p></p>

<p>It is difficult to see which way to focus our attention right now. For example WHERE did the commentary on the recent death in Haiti go? She had to have uncovered something important. </p></p>

        <p><p>They will never be put in jail.</p>
<p>This thing, this awful evil thing, goes way up the ladder of the who's who. It's their hazing, their shared rituals... those who have the most gold, make the rules and many of those in the rungs of power and wall street love trafficking and abusing and killing children. It's what they do.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean...? </p>
<p>Only full exposure to the world will do... videos, photos, names... EVERYTHING... </p>
<p>The FBI, CIA..DOJ.. they're all compromised... and if there are a few who are not? They just kill them if they open their mouths.</p>
<p>Find a spot to dump away... the only thing that will jail and kill these satanic pedophiles is public opinion... </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah I'm pretty sure they're already well aware of it. Didn't someone find a tweet from her saying something like, "Ever wake up to find yourself in a massive alt-right conspiracy you knew nothing about?" This was like, days ago... Can't find it now.</p>

        <p><p>The thing that stuck out most about that... was in the list of people they have on their side... they threw in "scientists". I wonder what that is supposed to mean. </p></p>

        <p><p>It is just an (illogical) appeal to an authority.  There are plenty of scientists, engineers, hackers, and artists in this pizzagate investigation collective too.  The difference is, we do not have to stand behind some illogical appeal to authority, because the evidence is damning in its own right.  </p>
<p>That being said, anyone that is not ultra-powerful (like Podesta, Clinton, etc.) is going to try to protect their public image on social because they don't have the tools or organizational insulation that the power players have.  </p>
<p>I am glad (in terms of loose ends for the investigation) these fringe conspirators were so cavalier with their disgusting shit.  </p>
<p>She is basically standing behind free speech saying, "OMG alt-right, racist, something, something, blah, blah".  They want to make it politically divisive, but it is not.  </p>
<p>They are standing behind free speech, using it to defending themselves.  So can we.  Hoorah for the 1st ammendment.   </p></p>

<p>I'm 3 out of 4, can confirm.</p>
<p>I love how she calls it waking up to an alt-right conspiracy theory. Um no bitch, child abuse is not a bi-partisan issue. It's not political, unless of course you consider all the scummy politicians who must be involved in this shit.</p>
<p>I had to find out what that even meant. Look at this nutcrackery:</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right</p>
<p>Oh good, it's a slur. Did Wikipedia become RationalWiki overnight? The first edit to that page was done in January 2016, around the height of Correct The Record. Some CIA-level "Conspiracy Theory" slur psyop going on there!</p></p>

        <p><p>How does your response in any way, reflect what my comment was about.  There are like fifty other comments of mine in this very thread where I am <em>actually being a moral policeman</em>.  </p>
<p>As a side note, I gotta say, being a moral policeman is super easy work when you have a bunch of weirdos trying to explain away gross references to child abuse as "art".</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes it is very important art.  In 100 years people will look back and say, "wow that Heavy Breathing comedy and music was way ahead of its time, what a momentous piece this is."  GTFO, I don't know how these sick fucks have gained enough fans to even warrant  a person coming here and try to make an argument that it is art, and should therefore be immune from criticism.  If it is, as you say, simply art, it fucking sucks.  This is my opinion, obviously, but I am not sure that you will find many people who like it outside of your small circle of weird pedo friends. </p></p>

        <p><p>lol @ saying people who call her "jew bitch" are anti semitic. shes a bitch who's a jew. not a bitch cos shes a jew. </p>
<p>besides, my belief is that these people aren't even jewish. they coopted the "jewish" tag to hide in plain sight and use "anti-semitism" etc to discredit anyone. i think this bridges the links between various conspiracy theories which say jews funded hitler etc. it begins to make sense when you think about it this way:</p>
<p>lucifarians/occultists/satanists pretend to be jews, engineer mass murder of real jews, create this stigma then hide behind it. </p></p>
