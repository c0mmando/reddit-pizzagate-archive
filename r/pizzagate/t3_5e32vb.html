        <strong>Before you accuse Michael Jackson...</strong>
        <p><p>I see a lot of people here who think that he had something to do with this pizzagate case, so I'm here to defend him. No, he had nothing to do with these sick people. May I remind everyone that he had a trial and he was found innocent. They searched his house twice and they found no CP in his house, no DNA, no semen, no hair, no nothing. The family that accused him tried to extort money from other celebrities, the mother was crazy as hell, she falesly accused security staff of J.C. Penny store and her children had to lie under oath all the time. Please read the court transcripts and FBI documents before you start to think that he was in a pedophile ring, lol. </p>

<p>The latest story that they found CP in Neverland is fake as well and created by the tabloid Radaronline. </p>
<p>"Mr. Jackson did possess “photos of nude children but they weren’t sexually graphic,” Mr. Zonen, a former Santa Barbara assistant DA, said. “They weren’t children engaged in sexual activity, and there was no child pornography. There were no videos involving children. There were videos that were seized, but they were conventional adult sexually graphic material. No children involved."</p>

        <p><p>Plus he was against the new world order. There is videos of him talking about it. They killed him to silence him since the pedo shit wasn't working</p></p>

        <p><p>Theres a phone call where he talks about people trying to kill him and a video where he says: “they’re like leeches…I’m so tired of it…They start out the most popular person in the world, make a lot of money, big house, cars and everything. End up penniless. It is a conspiracy. The Jews do it on purpose.” </p>
<p>I'm probly going to get blasted for anti-semitism (because that seems to be the worst thing a person can do to accuse a Jewish person of anything  - "To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize") there is a lot of evidence of Jewish ritual child sacrifice. Historical documents and paintings etc. </p>
<p>Anyone who will dare to look up who I quoted in my brackets will see that he was known for criticizing Jews and went to jail for posessing CP he denies owning on purpose (such as having it planted on him or downloading it while trying to uncover truth like many people on here have done in the name of justice).</p>
<p>Many people in high places ( I'm talking banks, government, Hollywood) share she same religion and it is not Islam as we have been made to fear.</p>
<p>I know what I am saying is tantamount to high treason but so is many of the things being discovered daily at this time. I only ask that it be looked upon with the same scrutiny that we should with everything. We have stopped questioning people and their motivations through fear. </p>
<p>It is time to face that fear. </p></p>

        <p><p>The fact that Cory Feldman defends MJ's innocence while stating Hollywood is full of pedos is convincing enough for me.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think he was a MK Ultra control victim too and tried to tell everyone but they then set out to get him. Maybe he was trying to protect all children and they twisted it around. Nothing surprises me.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think he was a target especially because of the Beatles catalouge. He was too powerful for some people in the corrupt music industry and they tried to destroy him because of it. It's always about money and power. The media began to call him a "freak" and "wacko" in the 80s, after he bought this catalouge in 1984 if I remember correctly. And it all started with the british press first. </p></p>

        <p><p>MJ was a pedo and the evidence is overwhelming. Especially in recent years. I didn't believe it for years, but now I can't help but know it.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not going to waste my time on someone who doesn't even want to read the court documents. You have the links right here so stop bitching and fucking read it you lazy asshole, because it's the most reliable source that you can get. </p></p>

        <p><p>There's a lot more evidence than just the court documents, even if you're highly invested in that not being the case.</p></p>

        <p><p>Kek ok, then show me this "overwhelming evidence." Something that is confirmed by the court or the police, not by the tabloids, the media and the accusers or their lawyers who now are saying that he molested someone 10,000 years ago. </p></p>
