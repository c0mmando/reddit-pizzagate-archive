        <strong>I have created an alternative to /r/pedocrats.</strong>
        <p><p>I can understand why /r/pizzagate mods want to be careful to avoid accusations of censorship, but we DO need a subreddit devoted to direct investigation only, without all the shitposts.  Unfortunately, /r/pedocrats is by invitation only, so we have no way to verify what is even going on in there (and they haven't responded to my request for an invite).  I have created /r/PodestaGate as a compromise between the need for contributors and the need to keep things on track.  It is public, but submission rights are restricted.  If you want to submit, message the moderators (currently just me) to tell them (me) what you want to submit, and I can give you submission approval.  Also, message me if you're interesting in being a moderator.  Thanks!</p></p>

        <p><p>It's good that there are subs investigating more discreetly. This sub didn't really work out as well as we hoped. Too easy to manipulate and confuse.</p></p>
