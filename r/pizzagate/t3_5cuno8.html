<p>He doesn't have a whole lot of information made public, but his friend list is public. He's got a lot of connections - 3581 to be exact. I think his friend list will be the most revealing of what we find here, if we are able to come across any pertinent information from it.</p></p>

        <p><p>The only way to contact him is with private message, so let's just hope no one tries. (SERIOUSLY GUYS, DON'T.) </p>
<p>He has a huge friend list and we need a lot of eyes to search through who his connections are. He's one of the primary people of interest we have right now.</p></p>

        <p><p>Is there anyone out there that knows how to remain anon who has/can make a fake FB account to friend him? If he accepts, look over any info that is only available to friends.</p>
<p>I would but I'm pretty new to the whole tor/vpn thing and only know the basics...</p></p>
