        <strong>the top post on my front page "Too much cheese. Got too greedy. "</strong>
        <p><ul>
<li>https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/5c6dar/too_much_cheese_got_too_greedy/</li>
<li>it depicts a mouse getting its head stuck in a outlet and a human helping them out ... allusion to mouse trap? .. those weird sexual things where men place their parts in a hole? ... or could be a allusion to sticking your neck out and getting stuck? .. allusion to peeping toms?..  hmm.. maybe nothing ..</li>

        <p><p>It is weird, almost as if he fed the mouse cheese until it got stuck, who does this weird shit anyways, and why are the top comments so strange? It's more /r/creepy than /r/funny to me. The elites are trying to "normalize" creepiness and pedophilia it seems like.</p></p>
