        <strong>I am a freelance journalist in Australia with a personal contact in the night editor at the Australian newspaper. I need help summarising the events surrounding @0hour's findings and his ban.</strong>
        <p><p>If you guys want to see this story covered in the mainstream media please help me get some sort of factual reporting of the current events down.</p>
<p>I am new to this sub and have only just started down the rabbit hole and am also not adequately protected with a internet condom. </p>
<p>For those of you who are well versed, can you help me gather a compelling case of evidence to share with my contact?</p>
<p>Thanks all, i owe you a pizza.</p></p>

        <p><p>Subreddit drama and outoftheloop are actively pushing disinformation campaigns against us - they're using the same old tactics. Just an FYI, those degenerates are over there in their echo chamber calling us racist because trump won. Fuck em, when the pedos start going to jail all over the world their gonna be singing a different tune </p></p>

        <p><p>Throwaway account @0hour exposed over 25,000 accounts involved in a child porn ring (in the search for seeking connections with pizzagate) with a community of followers and "master accounts" uploading multiple photos of CP (more than 10 per day) everyday, from YEARS ago. Then @0hour got banned for tweeting these accounts to the FBI and CIA immediately. #twittergate tweeters are being blocked currently.</p></p>

        <p><p>0hour got suspended many times before while live investigating and tweeting about #PizzaGate , Last Night he stumbled upon thousands and thousands of account with pic and video of pedopornography , accounts have been active for months/ years , some account even post multiple pic of different kids captioned " For Sale "( writen in arabic ),  with a phone number . <br>
After getting suspended most of the accounts reported were still up   </p>
<p>Edit : I would suggest writing separate article for twitterGate and pizzagate</p></p>

        <p><p>JAYSUS fucking click or STFU. Either see it and know, or trust and know...or STFU instilling distrust. I bit the bullet and I FUCKING saw it. It's true. SO if seeing is the only way you're going to be OK...then go see it. Right now two accounts are still live..at least the ones I left open on my browser..One is Arab man with what is clearly two WHITE teens who have CLEARLY been there a while, RP completely lacks enthusiasm or any erotic overtones because they're fucking being forced to act. One film shows this Arab buttfuking one of the young boys who is screaming..I'd scream too if that fucking massive dick was shoved up my ass. Pretend pleasure is pretend for anyone who has seen REAL gay porn. JAYSUS.</p></p>

        <p><p>The emotional feeling is horrible. I can't help thinking those guys are going to be murdered when they get "too old" and how it can feel...that that is your life...and no one is ever coming to help. WTF kind of life? I looked so I would know...but the feelings associated with knowing...and knowing nothing I can do...you do not want to feel this way.</p></p>

        <p><p>Look... I am a journalist. I wouldn't touch pizzagate with a 1,000-foot pole right now, and if I did write something about it, any self-respecting, integrity-driven editor would laugh me out of the room, and possibly fire me. </p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing solid to work with here, at all. Just confirmation bias and vague accusations. Not a shred of even circumstantial evidence. </p>
<p>There's a reason this hasn't been picked up by news outlets, and it's not conspiratorial. It's because until there is real evidence, running something like this would be irresponsible to a level that I'd consider it career suicide. </p></p>

        <p><p>There's nowhere to even start, man. This entire argument is based on bullshit speculation with absolutely no solid evidence of anything even being there. That's like saying I'm waiting for someone to actually see the Loch Ness Monster before I start reporting on its existence. That's exactly what I'm going to do. </p>
<p>I can do all the research I want, but until something solid emerges, I have absolutely nothing to report responsibly. My limited time and resources on the clock (earlier deadlines and no budget because nobody buys a paper any more) are much better spent reporting on things actually happening. Especially considering I enjoy being able to  support myself. </p>
<p>I love skepticism and truly believe we should question those in power whenever we can. I'm just trying to explain that there's a reason this isn't in the mainstream news, and it's not a conspiracy-fueled cover up. It's just not a story, at least not yet</p></p>

        <p><p>I was under the impression that what happened on Twitter is a completely separate issue from Pizzagate. The original comment that I responded to, which has been deleted apparently, was one in which a user asked OP to cover Pizzagate in addition to the Twitter scandal. </p></p>

        <p><p>Well, they didn't start investigating until they found substantial, tangible evidence and they didn't report until they had every single one of their ducks in a row. Not a corner went unturned.</p>
<p>That's what I'm saying. There's a lot that goes into reporting a story of this magnitude. It takes months, if not years of careful, meticulous reporting before ready to publish responsibly. </p></p>

        <p><p>I feel what you're saying, but sometimes, to make a name for yourself at the very least. To break that big story, you might have to go beyond your clocked hours. You may have to make a personal sacrafice to get that story. There's a risk of the story coming up dead for sure. It's a high risk high reward scenario. You might put all that time into it and come up empty handed. But, the greats never became great without taking a risk. </p></p>

        <p><p>I suggest you look at this thread 
https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e3gsh/research_into_the_decades_of_political_pedophilia/</p>
<p>It's much much bigger than these very recent findings of twitter, which I believe are intended to distract from the real lead, which is pizzagate. Meaning, implicate people in the outer (lower) rings to protect the inner (higher) ring</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't recall if I answered you..but if you have the list of accounts and a very strong stomach look for the account starting with AC9 and Excto... and you better have a strong stomach. Those accounts are still live and you do NOT need to be signed in to see that shit.</p>
<p>In case you don't want to look...A9C is an Arab with two white sex slave males...about 14-16ish very very thin..and they've clearly been under his control for a long time. The Arab never shows his face and he's clearly not concerned the boys will be recognized.</p>
<p>He makes the boys to RP..pretend to be uniformed school boys, pretend to be in a locker room with swim trunks, pretend to be in a preschool type play area including a play tent and RC car.</p>
<p>It is clear these boys are just following direction, I've seen gay porn and this isn't it. They are hesitant, slow, and very...it's clear they don't want to be doing this. Very thin...in one the Arab is buttfucking one of them the boy is screaming, there is no sign of lube and the dick is massive...the boy collapses a few times, the man slaps him and he puts his ass back in the air. His face is not visible but the screaming he's trying to make sound like pleasure, his penis is not erect, a clear sign this isn't fun for him.</p>
<p>The extomo.. site is young children, stolen photos, films of young kids playing together...they do not appear to be related and could be hostages.</p>
<p>That this is on Twitter still!!! is beyond comprehension and emotionally all I can think is those teen boys who do speak in an eastern euro accented sounding English...are clearly not...they are so damn thin...all I can think is for them this is their life, there is no escape, no love...and no one is coming for them.</p></p>

        <p><p>Speaking of Australia, weren't there whisperings around William Tyrell being taken by a pedophile ring?</p>
<p>Australia has a lot of very opportunistic crimes, though, when things like this do happen.  But there have been murmurs.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Please be very careful who u take things too. So many people are not here today for finding the truth out over the years and trying to publish it. You need to find out why this was being allowed on Twitter and whos at the Top before you concentrate on the small fry. Well I wish you well and Pray you succeed AUScentipede.</p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks, I am sure there are a large number of freelancers and even working corp journos in all countries trying to get this story published currently so I don't think I am in too much danger it is trending on social media.\was.</p>
<p>Pulitzer would be lovely but I'm fresh out of university and only have a few bylines to my name.</p>
<p>I haven't heard anything back from the Aus yet which wasn't surprising... I am trying to think of an outlet who would listen to this info but all my brownie points were with them. </p>
<p>Wonder if anyone's contacted RT doubt they would have a motive to not out this type of info?</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm a pretty successful shill and must be doing good work by agreeing this is an issue, calling for further investigation here, and asking for a clear recollection in a haste to email a contact at a media org.
It's space cadets like  you that waste peoples time in subs like this and the don.</p></p>

        <p><p>i completely agree with comments to seperate twittergate from pizzagate. They are two separate but linked stories and trying to contextualise twittergate with anything out of pizzagate unfortunately renders anything you say as uncredible to establishment media. We know its all definitely true but twittergate is easier digested and can be clearly fact checked and verified as true which is why it appeals to me so much as a story.</p></p>

        <p><p>Just seeing what it's all about. I like to keep up with conspiracy theories. I find them interesting, and a lot of times, even if not directly correct, they can bring other things to light. </p>
<p>Not trying to shit in your cereal or anything. Again, just explaining why this isn't being reported</p></p>
