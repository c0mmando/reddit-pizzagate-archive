<strong>MASSIVE ORGANIZATION THREAD!</strong>
<p><p>Alright, we've got a lot of kick ass citizen investigators on the Pizzagate case here and on 4ch/8ch, but I think it's time we get a lot more organized.</p>
<p>This is a full blown citizen investigation. The federal LEO may or may not be conducting their own investigations into this. We don't know for sure, as it is likely many insiders of our justice system in the US (and across the WORLD) are criminally involved at some level, even if they are simply turning a blind eye.</p>
<p>We need to get together a team to organize and plan our investigation going forward. Right now all of the info is scattered around and we have no clear leaders to guide everyone. In some ways this is good (since we're so decentralized it's hard for them to silence us completely), in other ways this is bad (massive disorganization and lack of understanding of the facts can set us back immensely).</p>
<p>Here are some things we need to organize:</p>
<p>1) Gathering and Reporting Evidence</p>
<p>So far, the best place I've found for us to externally upload all evidence without censorship is here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5clut3/created_a_github_repo_to_fight_the_censorship/
Tons of evidence is being uploaded onto reddit and the chans, but a lot of it is getting deleted or removed from feeds. Many uploaders are being shadow banned and may not even realize it as they try to share new evidence. So, for now make sure you upload any evidence you have to the Git repo. If you have any other better or alternative solutions to this issue, leave them in the comments below. Also, if you participate in the chans (I don't) please let them know to upload their evidence to the Git. I don't know if anyone has done this yet or not.</p>
<p>2) Verifying Evidence</p>
<p>You guys, we need to be extremely careful with making accusations on people without having solid, 100% confirmed evidence. If you don't have solid proof that person x did <strong>, or that person b owns or is connected to </strong> (you catch my drift) DO NOT MAKE DIRECT ACCUSATIONS ON THESE PEOPLE. You can speculate and ask questions, but do not accuse without proof. We do not want to wrongly accuse innocent people, and doing so could have a negative effect on our credibility, as well as the investigation itself.</p>
<p>3) Making Evidence Mainstream</p>
<p>It is true that many leads we follow may turn out to be dead ends, but we have also discovered many highly eyebrow-raising facts that we need to get out into the public. Facts that mainstream media is not and will not cover (you know how they are)... So we've got to take this task into our own hands until they start picking up these stories. For the time being, try to make everyone you know aware of the pedo scandal by discussing it on social media and in person. As we continue to get organized, we will need to create our own media teams for this investigation to push out the info to mainstream and independent media outlets.</p>
<p>4) ARCHIVE EVERYTHING. www.archive.is Take screenshots of photos if they don't show up on the archive. Remember to upload all of this info to Github.</p>
<p>5) Organizing Evidence</p>
<p>A lot of people are posting info that we discovered a week ago. A lot of people are discussing things that we've already discovered and talked about. We need to redirect this brainpower and have people investigating new leads, not the same old stuff we figured out days ago.
At some point we need to work together to create nice, organized documentation of all our confirmed evidence. We need to create dossiers on each person and business of interest. Then we need to combine every single piece of data we have on each person in one place attached to the individual's name (photos, businesses owned, etc). The amount of evidence and leads we have are starting to become overwhelming to keep up with without efficient organization. It is also becoming equally difficult to disperse all of this information to newcomers.</p>
<p>Please write your suggestions to solve this issue, as well as suggestions for other aspects of this investigation that we need to start organizing more efficiently. I will add relevant topics to the OP as I see them.</p>
<p>Further, if you are really good at a particular skill that can contribute to a specialized area of this investigation, please let us know in the comments. Maybe we can start forming teams. For example, a team to sort through and confirm the validity of evidence. A team to create marketing material for YT, FB, etc. A team to sort through persons of interests social media pages and friend/follower connections. And so on. </p>
<p>We've really got to get more organized, people. Leave your comments and thoughts below.</p></p>

<p><p>Another thing: stop posting on these fuckers' social media. Don't talk shit on their instagrams, facebooks, yelp pages for suspect restaurants, or youtube channels. I know they are already massively aware of the large number of people looking into them, but it doesn't help.</p></p>

<p><p>Perhaps the mods could give people flair with the persons area of expertise or what they are working on.</p></p>

<p><p>The best thing everyone could do is get all of the info together in a cross-linked wiki. I think relying on the reddit system for this to work may be a tad risky.</p>
<p>Anyone know of a good, free wiki that doesn't censor the content posted (save for the obvious).</p></p>
