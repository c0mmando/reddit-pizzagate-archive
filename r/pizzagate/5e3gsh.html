    +1973 
• Watergate 1973; CIA Director orders all ‘MK Ultra’ files destroyed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra MK Ultra, CIA sanctioned (1953-1973) mind control experiments including sexually induced stress (see: Kim Noble http://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/the-world-of-mind-control-through-the-eyes-of-an-artist-with-13-alter-personas/). This was the exposing of the US government actively working to influence the nations views, which would later be confirmed by a KGB defector who exposed communist Russia’s similar tactics and thus laid out the 20-30 year plan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bX3EZCVj2XA which politics aside, explain how with the right outlets, entire generations can be told an idea that goes against facts, which is deepened with induced stress that breaks normal A = B interactions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flUoqYEuPRY
   </p>
   <p>
    +1980’s
 • Large allegations of pedophile ring in the UK Parliment https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/07/a-big-political-cover-up-of-1980s-pedophile-ring-in-u-k-parliament/ largely falling on the shoulders of Cyril Smith http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/liberaldemocrats/10775341/Cyril-Smith-the-predatory-paedophile-protected-by-establishment.html who was close friends with now known serial pedophile &amp; deceased entertainer Jimmy Savile https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Savile_sexual_abuse_scandal who raised money for a children’s hospital (or children’s wing of a hospital) in which the Prince/Princess attended the opening ceremony and post-death it is greatly alleged that building this place for a largely orphaned community of children, he would visit the hospital and have any children of his pick. http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37517619 “26 June 2016: Dep. of Health publishes the result of investigations by 28 medical establishments; Savile found to have abused 60 individuals at Leeds General Infimary”. Savile rubbed elbows with all levels of UK politics.

    • Meanwhile, USA: Hollywood pedophilia happening to child stars. Corey Feldman + Corey Haim talk openly http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3611046/I-molested-passed-Corey-Feldman-details-horrors-Hollywood-pedophile-ring-reveals-Corey-Haim-just-11-raped-leading-life-drugs.html then Elijah Wood speaks but suddenly takes back all statements or says they were taken out of context http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/movies/elijah-wood-hollywood-child-star-pedophilia.html but only out of context in the sense that he claimed it didn’t happen to him, but doesn’t deny what he had said. Many convictions managers/behind the scenes people came in the following two decades, but were nearly slaps on the wrist http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3115792/Pedophile-X-Men-actor-convicted-sexually-abusing-Nickelodeon-child-star-working-underage-kids.html
   </p>
   <p>
    • Basically all the same was happening in Australia during roughly this time http://tapnewswire.com/2015/10/australian-victim-describes-her-experiences-at-the-hands-of-elite-paedophile-ring-in-canberra/ in the late 80’s, Peter Scully https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Scully was going to the Philippines and abducting children (later convicted), but questions arose how he’d keep coming back with kids into AUS and where those kids went. Eventually he just stayed in the Philippines and hosted ‘red rooms’ (dark web chat rooms/video live stream rooms) where people could pay to see a child sexually abused or tortured and interactively got to choose what would happen if they paid. Imagine cam-girls but…not http://www.sickchirpse.com/peter-scully-red-room-disturbing/ &amp; another explanation http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Red_Room &amp; what else is found in the deeper parts of the deep web on darknets http://www.sickchirpse.com/the-dark-web-truth/. Additionally, a still unidentified criminal that closely fits Scully’s criminal description remains at large (many speculate it was Scully) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Cruel &amp; https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/3mqall/mr_cruel/
   </p>
   <p>
    +1990’s
 • 1988-1991: Larry King/ Franklin pedophile ring, Nebraska. Allegations arose of a child sex ring in Nebraska linking with Larry King being at the forefront of it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_child_prostitution_ring_allegations. Conspiracy of Silence doc. Johnny Gosch abduction. “Who took Johnny” doc (48:45 in doc), house in CO found w/ secret under gound chamber, exposed by one of the abductors who came forth to explain the operation.
   </p>
   <p>
    • 1993: World Trade Center bombed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Trade_Center_bombing ruled in 2006 that it was planned, or at least known to happen before it actually did by the FBI http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/28/nyregion/tapes-depict-proposal-to-thwart-bomb-used-in-trade-center-blast.html. Important later when the retired FBI Head Ted Gunderson called this a conspiracy immediately and was correct, validates him later.
   </p>
   <p>
    • 1993: Vince Foster, White House Counsel/ C friend commits suicide https://www.rt.com/usa/356902-fbi-clinton-foster-reports-missing/ (1 of 33 close ‘friends’ who has died unconventionally since then http://www.wnd.com/2016/08/clinton-death-list-33-most-intriguing-cases/). Rumored to be stepping down from the counsel for reasons unknown, media scrutiny was placed on him and documents/files went missing from the federal archive. During the 2016 email investigation of HRC, the Federal Vault declassified remaining documents on the Foster investigation revealing that the bullet(s) found at the suicide scene did not match the gun Foster allegedly used to commit suicide https://i.sli.mg/l7EWWW.png and that the gun had been wiped and upon forensic testing, only 1 finger print was found and it didn’t match Foster’s https://i.sli.mg/D7caKf.png. Foster shared a close personal life with the C’s up until the months leading up to the alleged suicide.
   </p>
   <p>
    • 1994: Rwanda genocide. “120,000 children have been separated from their families” http://people.com/archive/who-will-save-the-children-vol-51-no-15/. Pres Paul Kagame under scrutiny of censorship/rigged election/90% chance of re-election http://www.economist.com/node/16750119. ‘C’ Foundation there from the start, Mr. C close friends with Kagame, questions on how money was raised/spent http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/19/us/politics/rwanda-bill-hillary-clinton-foundation.html.
   </p>
   <p>
    • Also in 1994: Conspiracy of Silence doc http://www.istockpicshub.club/2016/11/conspiracy-of-silence-1994.html meant to air on the Discovery Channel dropped at last second due to congressman’s threat to impose restrictive legislation for TV Cable industry. rights to film purchased by unknown persons; ordered all copies be destroyed
   </p>
   <p>
    • Late 90’s/early 2000’s: billionaire Jeffery Epstein owns an island in which many high profile people visit. Later it is discovered Epstein paid for underage girls to go to the island in a sex-slave operation http://nypost.com/2016/10/09/the-sex-slave-scandal-that-exposed-pedophile-billionaire-jeffrey-epstein/
   </p>
   <p>
    +2000’s
 • 9/11 2001: nation-wide shock as A=B interactions nationally are broken; ‘terrorism’ repeated - unifying ideas are easiest to plant in chaos, patriotism is the collective thought, war ensues. Important for later; American people barely told about specifics, just war. Wikileaks shows that Afghanistan was the wrong place to attack, perhaps other reasons to invade.
   </p>
   <p>
    • Flight logs show that Bill, without telling the secret service, visited the Jeffery Epstein's island 26 times between 2001-2003 http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/14/bill-clinton-ditched-secret-service-on-multiple-lo/ • mid-2000’s: pedophilia allegations start stacking up against Sigmund Freud’s grandson, Clement Freud. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/14/sir-clement-freud-exposed-as-a-paedophile-as-police-urged-to-pro/ IMPORTANT Freud had a villa in Portugal, important for later.
   </p>
   <p>
    • Dennis Hastert: Speaker of The House during this time. Later found guilty bank fraud linked to sexually abusing underage teen males (buying their silence) https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=dennis%20hastert
   </p>
   <p>
    • 2005: Jeffery Epstein investigation.
   </p>
   <p>
    • All three of the men previously listed were close associates of the Podesta Brothers. https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dtt3d/just_a_couple_of_my_friends_are_pedos_whats_the/
   </p>
   <p>
    • 2004/2005ish: Retired FBI Head Ted Gunderson (mentioned in the 1993 World Trade bullet point) gave this speech https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BplUD6kQYuU&amp;feature=youtu.be outright talking about elite level pedophilia rings. Here is a large archive, with sources and citations, supporting his claims http://educate-yourself.org/tg/.

    • 2007, Portugal: Madeleine McCann is abducted https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann#Further_police_inquiries_.282011.E2.80.93present.29.
   </p>
   <p>
    • John Podesta’s start May 4th, 2007 the day after Maddy was abducted, and it’s his assistant answering emails because he is out of town. Scotland Yard in 2013 digitally developed the faces of the two men who supposedly abducted Maddy https://i.sli.mg/Chk4Af. It is in this very same town in Portugal that the Podesta’s good friend, Clement Freud also had a holiday home, and oddly enough hosted the parents of McCann after the abduction http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3643373/PICTURED-sinister-holiday-villa-paedophile-MP-Clement-Freud-hosted-McCanns-weeks-Madeleine-vanished.html
   </p>
   <p>
    • 2008: John Podesta, who was chief of staff to Bill C was appointed counselor to Obama.
   </p>
   <p>
    • Maddy McCann case never solved, originally it was said to be a theft that went wrong leading to the thieves to take McCann, but that has been disproved. Now, Scotland Yard claims to know exactly who the people were but due to international protection laws, can not pursue the people http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/485524/Portuguese-detective-says-MI5-spies-know-what-happened-to-Madeleine-McCann.

    • Sept 13 2007: Bush says 168,000 troops will reduce to 5700 by the end of the year (146,000 remained at the end of the year)
   </p>
   <p>
    • Feb 27 2009: Obama changes plan to leave 35,000-50,000 troops in the Middle Eastern nation as a ‘transitional force’ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_U.S._troops_from_Iraq. Important for later; Syria.
   </p>
   <p>
    • Nov 2009: Laura Silsby sets up New Life Children’s Refuge in Haiti. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1249280/Haiti-earthquake-Missionaries-led-Laura-Silsby-accused-stealing-orphans.html “300 children have been given to families in US &amp; Canada. It is estimated 7000 children could leave the country in the next year. In many cases the parents have not met the children, just picked from photographs”.
   </p>
   <p>
    • Laura Silsby and Jeffery Epstein were both at Chelsea Clinton’s wedding.
   </p>
   <p>
    +2010-Present 
• 2010: Laura Silsby and 10 missionaries caught trying to smuggle 33 children, who still had parents, out of Haiti. Jorge Puello was her legal advisor. He at that time also under investigation for smuggling people across the US border and later found guilty http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/world/americas/12haiti.html. Silsby was found guilty in May of that year http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2010/02/laura_silsby_haiti_orphans_wou.html and upon the leaking of Podesta’s emails, we found that Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin would frequently forward articles to HRC and that HRC inquired several times about the organization prior to 2010 and additionally emails showing HRC contacting a lawyer in regards to 10 people arrested in a child trafficking ring https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794247777756860417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw (should be noted WikiLeaks is a precise organization with a 10yr track record of 100% authenticity, they would not just mindlessly retweet clickbait) &amp; http://www.charismanews.com/politics/elections/61050-redditor-clintons-connection-to-laura-silsby-discovered. This video explains the entire situation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBt2pRHUVNY.
   </p>
   <p>
    • 2011: Syrian Civil War begins. Syrian Government vs. protest groups to overthrow the President, Assad. Protest groups merged into one, Free Syrian Army. US Government funded the Free Syrian Army, which would later split and form ISIL. Many foreign powers funded either side, making this a manufactured crisis, a proxy war https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War.
   </p>
   <p>
    • Prior to the civil war, proposed pipeline plans http://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/is-the-fight-over-a-gas-pipeline-fuelling-the-worlds-bloodiest-conflict/news-story/74efcba9554c10bd35e280b63a9afb74 both pipelines would need to go through Syria. Russia supported Iran’s pipeline, US supported Qatar/Saudi’s pipeline. An anonymous twitter account pieced together all the pipeline strategy in addition to tying in Benghazi and also the $6B the US Government gave Iran (which was NOT for hostages… even though we got hostages in return) and how Iran in turn transferred the money to Russia which pissed our Res &amp; HRC off https://twitter.com/i/moments/792935309285613568. The 6 Billion could have also been for this deal http://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-to-sign-6-billion-gas-field-deal-with-total-cnpc-1478525034 in which Iran took the money, gave the US the middle finger, and then signed with France. Qatar gave the C Foundation a $1M gift which the Foundation didn’t notify the US Government, and since 1997 Saudi Arabia has donated between $10-$25M to the foundation. And while the US Government no longer funds the Free Syrian Army which turned into ISIL, Saudi Arabia still does http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/julian-assange-clinton-foundation-isis-same-money-saudi-arabia-qatar-funding-a7397211.html and so for HRC to implement a no-fly zone over Syria, it would cut Russia out of control which would lead to conflict as they are supporting the Iranian pipeline. However, even if the pipeline is the main Middle Eastern issue, there are other reasons to be creating conflict &amp; war.
   </p>
   <p>
    • Assuming US involvement in the Syrian proxy war is NOT what they talk about (liberating Syria from Assad) but rather to get a cut from a pipeline’s profit, the C Foundation involvement in an issue that involves displacing people (moving Syrians all over the world) is a pattern.

    • Over the last 5 years, 360 registered refugee children in the UK have no gone missing, over 200 have been missing for over 2 years http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/hundreds-of-child-refugees-missing-syria-alan-kurdi-aylan-theresa-may-have-vanished-since-arriving-a7222456.html.

    • In the recent week: 1) Iceland kicks FBI out after authorities lie about visit to protect Iceland from a cyber attack against government databases; turned out they were only there to gather information on WikiLeaks http://yournewswire.com/wikileaks-iceland-kick-out-fbi/. 2) Norwegian police infiltrate a pedophile network, arresting 20 and having 31 more suspects. It’s said they met on the dark web to run this http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/11/20/world/europe/ap-eu-norway-pedophile-network.html?_r=0 3) Within a day or two, it came out that the FBI was in control of 23 child porn sites on the dark web http://fortune.com/2016/11/12/rbi-child-porn-sites-sting/ 4) Today (11/20/16) Norway announced unprecedentedly that it will be cutting its donations to the C Foundation next year by 90% http://dailycaller.com/2016/11/20/norway-donations-to-clinton-foundation-to-fall-nearly-90-off-peak/ 5) Obama &amp; Merkel hold conference to call for internet censorship https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAvWIaFR7I4 days after it came out that Germany was missing nearly 9000 children. 6) Turkey, who has a vast internet censorship, moves forward with legislation that states if a man rapes/abuses an underage person, nothing will happen as long as that man marries that underage person http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38041510. 7) After reexamining emails from the Pedesta leaks, people started noticing repeated, oddly worded food-related emails coming up, which lead to PizzaGate.
   </p>
   <p>
    +PizzaGate 
• Pretty much summed up here:https://m.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5da0kp/comet_ping_pong_pizzagate_summary/?compact=true and with this short video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9itWsqzFMVo and this longer, more detailed video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8YdSvyp89E
   </p>
   <p>
    • Leading up to the strange, seemingly coded emails leaked, along with the senders and recipients of the emails, there were 2-3 decades filled with undebatable pedophilia in DC, and around the world in elite places. These are to serve as anchoring facts.
   </p>
   <p>
    • People started to look into the coding when Anthony Weiner’s (he himself is a pedophile, and husband to HRC’s top aide Huma Abedin) laptop was confiscated by the NYPD, and handed over to the FBI.

    • Emails showed communication with Comet Pizza, which is owned by James Alefantis who was the boyfriend of David Brock who founded Media Matters for America, and then Correct The Record (CTR), which was widely used during HRC’s presidential campaign.
   </p>
   <p>
    • Comet Pizza and the next 3 businesses are owned by HRC people. The head of the child trafficking branch of the FBI owns a pizza place 4 doors down from Comet called Besta (Beast) Pizza which recently changed it’s logo; the old one was a pedophile symbol for ‘boy lover’. The store in between Alefantis’ owned Comet Ping Pong and Buck’s is owned by a man who is hired by the owner of Politics &amp; Prose Bookstore, an associate/speech writer for, which is strange since he’s running Little Red Fox and also helping fun the bookstore https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://i.sli.mg/1XVf9d.pnghttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://i.sli.mg/1XVf9d.png.

    +Future 
• Salon magazine (who vehemently calls to end ‘fake news’ and yet posts things like this, HRC’s 95% of winning…which is owned/funded by IAC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAC_(company)#Publishing a company that Chelsea Clinton is on the board of members) published this article in May 2016 http://www.salon.com/2016/05/17/im_not_a_monster_a_pedophile_on_attraction_love_and_a_life_of_loneliness/ essentially calling be open minded towards pedophiles as an ‘orientation, using phrases such as “an ‘out’ pedophile” much like a non-closeted member of the LGBT community. Perhaps an interesting conversation if we’re considering it a mental ILLNESS or cause/effect of an emotional trauma taking place in ones childhood (not an orientation) but then in Sept. of 2016 Salon followed up with this article about how the previous article “outraged The Right” http://www.salon.com/2015/09/30/im_a_pedophile_youre_the_monsters_my_week_inside_the_vile_right_wing_hate_machine/ mixing in politics which automatically gains support because if one side finds this gross, the other side should, therefore, be supportive and thus this article is trying to arm-bar The Left into a potential future where pedophiles are viewed as a sexual orientation and that its absurd/bigoted to disagree.

    • The additional argument has been made that in the Middle East it is not uncommon to see a man marrying/owning a girl as young as 12 http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28250471 “1/3 of marriages in Jordan are of girls under the age of 18” &amp; also http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2001029/Child-brides-young-5-married-secret-middle-aged-men.html. Brian Stone, HRC Campaign paid writer and Huffington Post, a HRC Campaign paid publication https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/53056#efmABtADz wrote an article about how America should look to become just like Dearborn, MI (44% population Arab-American, largest proportion of Arab-Americans in the US), and then said “think of how far ahead we’d be as a country if we were following Dearborn’s lead” http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-stone/what-if-america-looked-like-dearborn_b_9328288.html which is interesting since the Middle East as a whole doesn’t rank on the global ranking index for “best countries to live in” at all, (below North Korea which his the last ranked) http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking no-one are ranked other than Qatar, U.A.E., and Israel which are low https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/dec/07/world-education-rankings-maths-science-reading and the U.A.E. only has a decent economic ranking due to oil, the rest are in the bottom 1/4th globally http://statisticstimes.com/economy/countries-by-projected-gdp.php

    • Which leads to the point that when objectively looking at the treatment of Islam vs Judism or Christianity in the US, we see a suppression of Christian ideals (heterosexual-marriage only, anti-abortion; again, doesn’t matter your personal beliefs, just objectively comparing) and the praise of Muslim successes. Example: President-elect Trump to appoint Stephen Bannon; anti-semitic remarks. The next DNC will likely select Keith Ellison as chair, a man who while being the spokesman for the Nation of Islam in his 30’s constantly had anti-semitic remarks, and this is not in the media http://dailycaller.com/2016/11/17/democrats-must-scrutinize-keith-ellisons-anti-semitic-past-and-ties-to-radical-islam/

    • Go back to the 60’s with MK Ultra, and the 80’s when KGB defector Yuri Bezmenov talked about Soviet use of ideological submersion. Now plug in globalism; the movement to become 1 people, to have no borders. On a global scale, this effects major international corporations being able to more freely do trade, utilize areas of land, control smaller nations and larger amounts of people. Think of how in Europe, countries were told to set aside their own cultures to make way for refugees and their culture. Remember that the refugee crisis we know almost certainly know was not about ‘freeing Syria’ from Assad, but rather simply profiting from oil. Germany is on the verge of collapse http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/16/opinion/can-germany-be-honest-about-its-refugee-problems.html as is France https://www.rt.com/news/340954-france-migrants-crime-poll/ and this article talks about how Muslim men, not because of who they are, but because of the culture they come from, are 23 times more likely than Swedish men in Sweden to commit rape. It also talks about how Japan did not open it’s doors to refugees stating Japan doesn’t want to commit “cultural suicide”http://dailycaller.com/2015/10/23/sweden-opened-its-doors-to-muslim-immigration-today-its-the-rape-capital-of-the-west-japan-didnt/. So, step 1) is to, through war and other events that break the averages persons’ A=B interactions through hysteria/chaos, develop a mass mindset that it is ok to move around/displace countries worth of people and that where ever they land we are helping them even though the chaos is fabricated, and that their culture needs to be recognized and further more, praised over the home country’s as this is a step in creating a global, singular culture. Step 2) rationalize and come to accept pedophilia (as that Salon article attempted to do) so that when moving around masses of people, it doesn’t have to be hidden that thousands of children are going missing since pedophilia will be a new orientation to respect. When 47% is dependent on a nations government http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/09/the-47-who-they-are-where-they-live-how-they-vote-and-why-they-matter/262506/ it only takes 5-10% to have a majority and which point most people will do what the government wants to do, since they rely on the government. Just this alone ties in with a globalist idea; would it not be better for less people to become more self-sufficient individuals? Going back to the ‘acceptance’ of pedophiles as sexual orientations, this seems like a thought planted to grow in a couple decades to come to fully accept pedophiles as a natural orientation.

    • This mentality gets all the people involved in PizzaGate off the hook and forms a global society that caters to elitist needs.

     I believe that paedophile secret societes have been existing for centuries.
Imagine something like the Templars from Assassin's Creed: once they human societes formed they were not able to do their shit freely anymore, therefore they had to hide themselves and have enough power to keep doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is why there are so many paedophile priests in the church. 
The church has had political power for centuries and becoming a priest requires either to be literally insane or have hidden reasons to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the enlightment the church has started to lose its power, becoming almost powerless in the present day therefore the paedophiles have gone into politics and media and they seem to have been successfull in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is why antiscientific and nonsense concepts like gender that harm children have been pushed through politics and the useful idiots of the movements of the 60s and 70s (and among them there were many paedophiles)
    </p>
    <p>
     Now it's their final push: they are pushing for a society that accepts paedophilia with these concepts as trojan horses.
    </p>
    <p>
     People are not buying it and they have pushed it harder in the last few years with the entire MSM going full feminist and LGBT groups used to pass crazy laws that have nothing to do with their rights or their health.

    This is an amazing compilation. A point you touched on was the global movement. My take on how all this fits together into one plan:
   </p>
   <p>
    The international bankers, who also sit on the boards of the major corporations are the controlling elite. To increase the world economy they need to increase the number of consumers. To do this they need to evolve to a single government model.  This is the reason for the no borders and mass immigration. In order to get there they need a lot of people on their team. They get these people by seducing them with influence, power, money, sex, drugs, and various perversions. Then they can black mail them into doing what needs to be done to achieve the end goal. The structure is like a combo of multi-level marketing and the mafia. It is a cunning plan. When people fall out of favor their career goes in the toilet, or they get arrested, or they die mysteriously, or they disappear. The actual plan and methods are probably limited to a thousand people or less. The Clintons are mid level and probably not in on the overall plan. Soros is most likely higher, but not a prime mover.  In the end it will, sorry to say, probably be successful. Keep up the good work peeps, you never know when you can do something that will actually crash the machine.

     Thanks. Some grammatical errors/typos after doing this for 10hrs, but I think the timeline is solid. The point of looking at it on a wider timeline and broader scope was for anchoring facts. By this I mean PizzaGate is pretty unbelievable and most people will assume it's just a conspiracy (even with mounting evidence and undeniable strange things, like jimmycomet Instagram).
    </p>
    <p>
     When you look back and see that high level pedophilia has been going on since the 70's (and before obviously), and you lay it out case after case and state name after name, you form an equation: A = B.
    </p>
    <p>
     So if you develop A; that factually we have known about pedophilia at high levels of government, and that we have known several names involved in PizzaGate have already factually been labelled pedophiles, then when you present B; that PizzaGate is real, it is both easily receptive and also more credible when you put it up against already proven cases.
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact, knowing the history of political pedophilia, it shouldn't really come as shocking news at all.

    One thing I don't get is the Satanist angle.
   </p>
   <p>
    There's been claims of pedophelia for decades, and there's always been pedo rings getting busted. Where does the satanism come from?

     I believe realistically, the "Satanism" is an aesthetic angle as a part of PSYOP.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's part of the cover.  What normal person is going to believe rational people practice Satanism?  They don't.  That's the point.  It's a tactic to get your average joe to dismiss it because once they hear you talking about "Satanists" they automagically react: "lol u cray cray."
    </p>
    <p>
     It's not satanism.  It's straight up psychopathy that's mentally fulfilled through the exploit/rape/murder of the vulnerable.

      Call it what you want. Luciferianism/Opposite of "god".
     </p>
     <p>
      Check up the Alex Jones Bohemian Grove Video. (People from the Elite in robes imitating child sacrifice)
Remember the Spiritcooking connection to Podestas. And also the talk about sacrifice to "moloch" in the emails. If you read about Moloch and child sacrifice, that goes way back beyond any PSYOP im afraid.
     </p>
     <p>
      Edit: if you ment that they are also using it to inflict trauma on their victims for psyops. Sure. I were only answering about the original origination.

       This goes back to the Khazarians.  750 AD.  Paganism.  That is a good starting point for anyone who wishes to understand what is going on.

      This is the reason I stayed away from Satanism. The reason/motive behind all this isn't as important as the fact that it is being done, and has been proven to have been done for several decades.
     </p>
     <p>
      This is also the reason I didn't talk about the theory that all this pedophilia could be used as blackmail to keep people in check; while it could certainly be true (imagine if Jeffrey Epstein had secret cameras on his 'Orgy Island'...), there is no evidence to back it up. This is not a post about speculation, everything is sited and backed up other than what I think the future holds.
     </p>
     <p>
      If it lines up with Satanism, so be it, but it's already hard to fathom as is and I just wanted to talk about facts that I could back up with some evidence. Notice how I mostly used 'REAL news' articles so that this dumb 'fake news' thing (their attempt to censor the truth) can't be argued.

      Is it psyop though? At this point they are probably killing the children ritualistic style. It's no longer an unbelievable thought.

      It is more than a religion, it is philosophy and psychology (westernly speaking), they clearly know for many many time!, it is the use of mind states, that start loosing its rational sense and start being .. magic

     Check up the ancient Pagan god: Moloch
People even mentions sacrificing to Moloch in the podesta emails.
Moloch was known for Child sacrifice.

     I think it's more about creating a group that people who want power then have to conform into. Because as we know now the politicians don't have the ultimate power, it's the big bankers like Soros who use them as puppets.
    </p>
    <p>
     To get these puppets to do some seriously bad stuff, like going into a war just for money not caring about the human cost they'd have to be seriously desensitized or removed from their humanity. So the satanism acts like a good gate for the upper power structure to only get people in who are willing to be truly evil.
    </p>
    <p>
     But yeah, things are no doubt complicated by the passage of time, so there are probably multiple reasons for it.

    TL;DR:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <p>
      shows how gov't for a long time has been trying to figure out ways to subdue the masses. MK Ultra. KGB defector, explains this and predicts current societal trends.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      shows cases of political/elite pedophilia from the 70's onward, on a global scale.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      explains several different FBI documents that explain how certain suicides weren't suicides, reinforcing the power elites have to maintain silence amongst those who know but may not like what's going on.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      explain how the Syrian refugee crisis is somewhat fabricated. How moving masses of ppl, thousands of kids go missing. Just like in Rwanda after the genocide. Just like in Haiti after the earthquake. A certain Foundation is at all these places. Thousands of children missing from their refugee placements in Germany, Sweden, UK, France. Not located, questions being raised of foul play. Perhaps a side business of war is the displacement of people.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      lays out evidence from previous scandals to show that the people involved in PizzaGate have previous been tied to pedophilia and that PizzaGate shouldn't be as surprising as you may think. A specific case of a child kidnapping involving a prominent US lobbyist and a UK parliament member; cover-up.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      A former president flew to a pedophile's privately owned island 26 times without telling the secret service. After the fact, the pedophile was charged.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Breaks down current events (11/20/16) and how countries like Norway are seemingly stepping away as if to make sure their hands are clean. Head of US Intelligence steps down. Reports show the FBI operate 23 Tor servers containing child porn.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      explains PizzaGate; Wash DC elite own several suspect shops and speak in code in emails that lines up with pedophilia, shops have ties to pedophilia, major political fundraisers have been held at these random 'family' pizza places.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      concludes with the concept of ideological submersion; starting a conversation about how pedophilia isn't wrong, it's just an 'orientation'; leading to following generations acceptance via mass/mainstream media reinforcement, thus relieving these elite pedophile groups of their secrecy.
     </p>
    </li>
   </ul>

    sidenote: some of you might notice I'm just saying 'C' or 'C Foundation". I think a big reason PizzaGate might get suppressed is because the average person is being told that it's a certain faction of a political party's "extremist conspiracy theorists" who are coming up with all this 'nonsense' about PizzaGate, thus immediately dismissing it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Everything written here is supported with mostly mainstream articles.
   </p>
   <p>
    I thought it was important to, when possible, omit full names as to not let readers assume an immediate bias and instead look at the material more wholly and objectively.
   </p>
   <p>
    I think most of us can figure it out, but the point is that this isn't political, it's ANTI-political. It's the people vs. politics.

     Maybe you didn't read any of the post:

     1) Clintons working with FBI actually gives them more protection/more untouchable. When you appoint the head of the branch that investigates child trafficking, and that person also owns a pizza place 4 down from Comet Pizza, it's an easy assumption to make that there are connections.
2) By creating a global state, bankers an elites like George Soros (who is an outspoken supporter of globalism) can access a larger consumer base, and from a government standpoint there will be a larger populace under the control of a central government, which ties into the US national government deoendency is at 47% and rising; you make the masses need you and then they can't stop your actions since they are dependent on you (won't bite the hande that feeds).
3) by implementing a no-fly zone in Syria you are directly screwing Russia who is working with Iran to build a pipeline. Russia supplies Europe with 25% of it's oil, so without this pipeline Russia's economy will be ruined. Their backs are up against the wall, and the only chance they have against the US would be nuclear action.
4) as stated towards the end, planting the ideologically submersive seed now that pedophilia is an 'orientation' will make tomorrows generation more prevy to this idea and thus in the future these organizations dont have to be secret.

    For people looking for a video version that also ties in past pedophilia leading up to PizzaGate I recommend this video by Titus Frost: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi6ryNOg8z0

     Thanks for the additional info, I was also going look into Afghanistan/Iraq missing children too to see what those numbers might look like as additional support showing all these US-involved wars in that area are leading to the displacement of kids, and specifically children.

     Actually, no. This is very well written and supported. I'm sharing this with many friends and family. And before you try to personally attack me, no we are not crazy neck beard alt-right racists. Not that it really matters, but I am a college educated, scientist, minority. I have thought extremely critically about this information, and it all adds up.

      Not only does it add up, its been confirmed world wide by numerous sources including the FBI and other law enforcement agencies that this does exist. The best way to hide is in plain sight.

        Then respond like I did and move on. Engagement with bullshit is a legit disinformation technique.
