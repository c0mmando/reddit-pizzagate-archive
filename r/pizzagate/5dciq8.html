    That's not Comet, it's a bar called Tropicalia that is under a Subway.

     Shit, I wanted to be done talking to you because you are clearly a no-goodnik, but I have to ask: how the fuck do you know so much about these people and places?  It is fascinating.  If you truly know these people well, and there is nothing to see here, post a thread explaining how all of this information is wrong.  No one here wants there to be a seedy Pizza place catering to an elitist cabal of pedophiles.  We simply want to make sure kids are not getting hurt.  If you can humanize this group in any way you should really take this opportunity to.  We would love to hear something positive these people have done for their community.  Why should we like these people/places you keep defending, or at the very least, know so much about?

      I've been to Comet many times over the years. I've seen the band and know them. I've never seen or heard of anything bad ever happening there, involving any of the people who work there, or involving the band. I have never heard a single rumor of pedophilia. There is no rash of missing children in DC.

     <p>
      And no I don't count "weird art" or "bad taste jokes" as evidence of anything whatsoever.
     </p>
     <p>
      Everyone who goes to Comet likes it. Good food, laid-back vibe, nice people. They have some good bands. They support local bands and local artists. There is literally nothing not to like unless you are one of those who believe that weird art and bad jokes = pedophile sex ring.

       Almost every neighbor of a pedo or serial killers says "but he was such a nice guy" etc. They tend to befriend the naive because they don't have the instinctual feeling something might be wrong or they're quick to dismiss it.
