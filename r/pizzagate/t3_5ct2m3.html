        <p><p>We have been in contact with an individual claiming to be this persons father. He is very concerned with the privacy of his claimed son. </p>
<p>Regardless of any likeliness of his involvement with any other matters (always felt this was a tenuous, somewhat silly lead), this is likely what is going on.</p></p>

        <p><p>Evidence to support what claim? That myself and the other mods have been in contact with an individual claiming to be this persons father?</p>
<p>That would break a pretty serious ethical code in my book. Feel free to message the mods if you feel the need to have this confirmed by the others though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You seem eager to dismiss this lead,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not eager to dismiss this lead. Everyone has focused their efforts all over the spectrum of collective evidence so far obtained. Out of all of it, I feel like this is one of the weakest aspects to this case as this is very little to go on. There are much stronger aspects to investigate in my opinion.</p>
<p>The one line I would like people to avoid however, is where we begin to post information that was previously private. I personally don't care, but Reddit is pretty strict about it and it can result in the end of our investigation on this sub.</p>
<p>Let me put on a tinfoil hat to finish this. I think the Boston Marathon fuckup here on Reddit was an intentional, agent provocateur moment. It heavily discredited the investigating strength of Reddit as a whole. I see this potentially being the same. People don't want to see on the news how Reddit ruined the life of some 12 year old kid by falsely linking them to an underground pedophile group. It just doesn't sit well.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's a strong lead. The "Dad" had wierd ass pics of the kids sometimes in compromised positions or not fully clothed. Plus the kids looked stressed and not happy</p></p>

        <p><p>Also, is there a real connection between Eli and Pizzagate? Or are these just videos of a kid doing reviews of different restaurants?</p></p>

        <p><p>Changling. This was a small paragraph from the most recent <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5b1qtf/comet_ping_pong_pizzagate_summary/">summary post</a></p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/MFH99K.jpg</p>
<p>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-tiu325HYQk</p>
<p>From the above, Amanda Kleinman might have some familiarity with the child and may have been to the one to make his costume. Anything beyond those two things is supposition, but extremely creepy supposition.</p></p>

        <p><p>Please elaborate why you have concluded that.</p>
<p>The child has been recorded and archived both in front of Comet and displaying a "changeling" costume that is a near identical match to A.K.'s puppet.</p></p>

        <p><p>Thank you for saying this. As you can see, this is kind of going away. I'd like everyone to be able to see that your account looks legit and we have every reason to believe that this is a total false trail and the video being removed was for innocent reasons.</p></p>

<p>This was the Eli DCforTeens video review of Commet Pizza. There were around 5 video reviews here 12 hours ago. </p>

        <p><p>I will mention that someone claiming to be a parent of Eli has been in contact with the mods of this subreddit and said that they do not want their son involved in this. Do what you guys wish, but it might just be a concerned parent trying to distance their son from a pedophilia topic subreddit.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, Discord, 4/8chan, and even PasteBin aren't indexed like Reddit, and I don't want a search on his name to come up with this accusation. Simple, there is no connection, that is my position on this. The videos showed up because I have a lot of SEO experience. We did another set of videos that got over 2 million views.  </p></p>

        <p><p>It appears a connection was made via this post but now the vid is private. I pulled the following from the most recent summary post:</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/MFH99K.jpg</p>
<p>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-tiu325HYQk</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjyWp8Xj03I</p>
<p>From the above, Amanda Kleinman might have some familiarity with the child and may have been to the one to make his costume. Anything beyond those two things is supposition, but extremely creepy supposition.</p></p>

        <p><p>This whole Eli thing has been a huge distraction for people in my opinion. There really isn't anything there other than the kid posted an awkward review of Comet Ping Pong while in front of the restaurant. Now, I'm not typically one to discourage people from taking up leads but this has no real possible outcome.</p>
<p>Unless the kid was on a missing child registry, we have pretty much nothing to go on with this lead. Secondly, we walk a tight line between sharing public info and providing doxxed profiles of individuals as it is. The situation is further exasperated in this case as the subject focuses on a child. </p>
<p>I'd urge people still intent on following this lead to tread lightly. We cannot wrongfully implicate people in this case. Future lives are indeed at stake if anything were to get runaway press coverage. Responsible reporting is a must.</p></p>

<p>I never said it couldn't become relevant. But we are not true investigators with the authority of the law behind us. There is only so far we can go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Again, you discourage further investigation and conclude "nothing to be seen here"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I am doing so because of the reason I stated. Compiling publicly available information is fine. </p>
<p>I personally don't give two fucks if research in depth, the private life of any individual you wish. It becomes a problem when you post this private information on Reddit as it is a doxxing event which could shut this subreddit down for good. We tread that line finely as it is and it is my duty to ensure that does not occur.</p>
<p>If you feel this restricts you too much, feel free to take your efforts elsewhere, as they threaten this environment.</p></p>

<p>Nothing in this thread. I was speaking in general. The problem is the overly emotional response this garnered. The presumption was that the video was removed for nefarious reasons, whatever they may be. It seemed that the general sentiment was to go into overdrive in finding anything and everything on Eli, public or private.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm using my bias in this interpretation of the events, but with the removal of the video and the individual that contacted us claiming to be an upset father, I'm inclined to believe that the father wants to get his uninvolved kid away from this mess.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I'd suggest posting any dark grey area information in an image post so that any involved parties cannot be falsely linked by a simple text search. I think that allows for an avenue where we can all read it, and it protects the potentially innocent person from being permanently tied to the information. </p>
<p>Again, dig as much, as deep, as ethically as you wish. Just be responsible in broadcasting that information.</p></p>

        <p><p>The video was not removed, it was set private. The reason is that there were a lot of negative comments, much worse than Reddit. I talked to Eli about it, and the result was that he wanted all of his images and videos removed - he's scared of all this. </p></p>

<p>This is false. Unless it could be proven that people were posting false information to intentionally defame an individual, free speech applies.</p>
<p>We all can understand your discomfort in being brought into a very unwelcome scenario. However, intimidation is not tolerated in this public forum. If you have complaints with regard to content you are directly linked to, direct those complaints to the moderators.</p></p>

        <p><p>No, this is something different, this deals with a child, and a different set of laws apply, especially since Reddit users are claiming that the child is a victim of sexual abuse. It relates to COPPA - I've talked to an VC investor that has invested in tech products for kids. It's fine that you disagree, and insist on wasting your time. My goal is to get the name removed from indexed pages that are associated with him being an sexual abuse victim - a reasonable thing for a parent to do, especially since at least its good ethics to protect victims, at worst (for you) it's a violation of COPPA. </p></p>
