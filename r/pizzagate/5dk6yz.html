   <strong>
    Theory About Tony Podesta and Art
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I posted this as a comment in the
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5da0kp/comet_ping_pong_pizzagate_summary/">
     well documented summary
    </a>
    compiled by /u/DumbScribblyUnctious and reposting it as its own thread in longer form because it got buried and failed to spark discussion.
   </p>
   <p>
    What's come up a lot recently is art and its usefulness in money laundering. It makes a lot of sense and forced me look over the summary again for anything art related. After rereading the Tony Podesta section and listed sources, I couldn't help but think about the possibility of Tony Podesta using art as an alibi/cover.  As you'll see, he and his former wife Heather Miller talk about their extensive travels all in the name of art.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you're reading this, it's likely you are familiar with the Madeleine McCann case, the controversy around her parents, and
    <a href="http://sli.mg/D3RWWm">
     the sketches and their uncanny resemblance to these smug bastards
    </a>
    .  The problem? No evidence they were in Portugal. But is it possible we can retrace Tony Podesta's steps? I think it might be. Before I go any further, no, I have not tied him to Portugal at the time of her disappearance.  Unfortunately, I am not a crime solving superhero. I am simply providing evidence that made me think of art as a cover/alibi and  the possibility of tracking Tony Podesta's movements based on his love of art. I have not done a lot of digging, but I wanted to share this idea with you all.
   </p>
   <p>
    From  same
    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2004/apr/20/usa.world">
     Guardian article (2004)
    </a>
    :
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Most people in their positions would spend their leisure time unwinding. Instead, they make what Miller calls "Herculean" trips to Europe and further afield to buy art. It is perfectly normal for them to leave Washington on Friday evening and return the following Monday morning, having visited more than one European capital in the meantime. […]
    </p>
    <p>
     Taylor-Wood says 'Tony Podesta is someone who has intrigued me for a long time, partly because he is a very passionate and brave collector of art, partly because he's constantly travelling. I wanted to read about him because I admire his spirit - not to mention his resilience to jetlag'.
    </p>

    I'm not sure if that last part is a part of the article.

   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     The up-and-comers Tony favors travel the international contemporary art circuit, the gold line from Chelsea to the Venice Biennale.  [...] To keep themselves in pictures, Tony and Heather jet to art fairs and biennials from Sao Paolo to San Sebastian -- often just for the weekend. Theirs is a life led breathlessly, moving from airport to dinner party.

     Still, Heather recalls the day, just weeks into her relationship with Tony,

    but that he does travel to support:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Co-conspiratorial leanings aside, Tony likes to see his artists' results and will travel to openings to support them. "Sometimes our life feels like an art travelogue," Tony says of the constant back-and-forth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He travels more than any artist I know. And artists travel a lot," Morris says. "Tony would show up and surprise you."

   </blockquote>
   <p>
    What do you think? Do you think it could be used as an alibi/cover-- the possibility of going to see/purchase art but going to special "parties" afterwards, or doing both? Do you believe it's feasible to retrace his movements based on researching artists whose work he's purchased, artists he's supported, and when/where their exhibitions/pieces were on display? Could we apply this idea of having an official or legitimate reason to travel as a cover for perpetrating sexual abuse to other implicated individuals?
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     When digging into individuals, keep the questions of WHEN and WHERE in mind!
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    If you see a mention of where they were, make a note of it. Is it mentioned on a news article or did you find a date? Write that shit down!
   </p>
   <p>
    The problem for a good portion of the implicated?
    <strong>
     They are public figures
    </strong>
    : celebrities, actors, politicians, lobbyists, and business people. What do rich cunts like to do the most? Fly around the world (FLIGHT LOGS!!!) in their private jets to: speak/attend charity events and conferences, meet with foreign governments/politicians, attend high level business meetings, think tanks, movie premieres, and art shows and exhibitions among other things. Many of these events receive some level of publicity, media coverage, and can be documented. I figure these are trails they cannot erase. They throw this shit in our faces on a daily basis as news. If we can tie individuals to places at certain dates/times, it will only strengthen our evidence, making it harder to refute and help connect the dots.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     TL;DR
    </strong>
    : The pedophilia/child trafficking ring is international. Tony Podesta travels a lot domestically and internationally for art and is implicated. A convenient cover for sexual abuse? Could we track him based on documented artists he likes/supports and where they've had exhibitions? Can we apply this theory of using legitimate reasons for travel to cover up the real reason (sexual abuse) to other implicated individuals? When digging, remember to write down places they've been and when they were there so we can bag these sick fucks!!!

    I think your looking into flights is a good idea, because you're right, it provides a concrete
    <em>
     when and where
    </em>
    for the people involved (i.e., they could/couldn't have done this because the plane touched down at such and such a time). There's been some talk of his favorite artist, who often creates paintings of children in 'vulnerable' positions (can't remember the name atm). In any case, one of the things I keep noticing in these articles about the art that Tony Podesta and the DC Crew like is that it's very 'brave' (i.e. shocking, gross). I think you're on to something with the time and place thing though.

     Thanks. I probably should have chosen a different title, art was what spurred the idea/line of thinking.

     I mentioned the McCann case  mostly to tie my idea together, but it is interesting. They caught the mole by his eyebrow but didn't catch whatever is on the bottom left of his face. There is controversy and evidence pointing to the parents in the case as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     Regarding the art and Portugal, I haven't done any research outside of the cursory review of the articles from the summary. The articles mention several artists he's purchased bought from and supported that could serve as a starting point.

    I personally know a gallery and the people who work there, where Tony and his brother bought art from.
   </p>
   <p>
    The artist definitely has no connections to any paedophile rings or shit like that, I know her personally also. When aforementioned gallery stopped her funding and didn't have her as a client anymore the Podestas stopped coming altogether.
   </p>
   <p>
    All in all, they liked her art, bought many a item, she stopped and they stopped coming to my city.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now I'm not trying to make the Podestas out innocent, but you are talking about shit with NO evidence just heresay and imagination.
   </p>
   <p>
    The artist I've mention had graphic art involving children, but I definitely do not think they used their art buying as a cover. Both brothers are known to have ENORMOUS art collections containing a ridiculous range of works and they are constantly travelling internationally, they have 1001 reasons to cover why they are travelling somewhere, singling it down to TONY PODESTA USED HIS ART BUYING TO COVER STEALING KIDS is stretching things to far.
   </p>
   <p>
    I do believe the emails are our key to nailing both of them, we need more proof of their credibility. Until then nothing concrete can be gained.

      I'm not giving any names or locations.
     </p>
     <p>
      This sub, as good a job some people are doing uncovering the truth, are also quick to scream guilty with no proper evidence.
     </p>
     <p>
      The artist I know personally does pretty graphic photography involving children, Tony Podesta has quite a few of her works. However until the emails have been confirmed to have come from Wikileaks we're all jumping to far out conclusions with nothing substantial to back it up. The Podestas have a collection involving THOUSANDS of art works. It's a pointless angle that's only going to get innocent people caught up in it.
     </p>
     <p>
      When Tony Podesta helped run Teddy Kennedys campaign they couldn't afford to pay him cash after they lost. He was given a tube with 15 prints in them, most were originals from the beginning of the pop art era. He didn't realise what he had until 10 years or so later. They were worth a pretty penny, much more than what he was being paid by Ted Kennedy and that sparked his collection.

       You don't have to reveal the artist's name/location in the open, but at least tell me via a direct message so I know you're not just making things up.

      Now I'm not trying to make the Podestas out innocent, but you are talking about shit with NO evidence just heresay and imagination.

     There's a reason I called this a theory. I never claimed that what I said was the truth or correct and I made a deliberate effort to avoid coming off that way. I also said that I have not done a lot of digging on it. I think it's obvious I would not be able to find actual proof that they would be using it as a cover, and I specifically say
I am simply providing evidence that made me think of art as a cover/alibi and the possibility of tracking Tony Podesta's movements based on his love of art.

      Both brothers are known to have ENORMOUS art collections containing a ridiculous range of works and they are constantly travelling internationally, they have 1001 reasons to cover why they are travelling somewhere, singling it down to TONY PODESTA USED HIS ART BUYING TO COVER STEALING KIDS is stretching things to far.

     I agree there are many other reasons for him to be traveling, art was just the first thing that came to my mind that you could track him with and got me thinking of when/where. You can replace art with other 1000 reasons you can think of, the main idea behind this was being able to connect implicated individuals to places at certain times, and in Tony Podesta's case I thought art would be a good way of doing so. It was not my intention to claim that every time they went to get art and support artists they were abusing children. Indeed that would be a stretch.
