    Attention Pizzagate Researchers: Offensive and Defensive Legal and Tactical Tools; A legal prep discussion I was asked to re-post
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Your research is excellent.The stuff over on /r/pizzagate is also. I spent a good deal of time with it, until I ran into the photo of the child with a knife at her throat. Minutes later, I got wind of the mods warning us about slander. Yeah.....
    <big pause="">
     I want to give you my "I'm a law grad but not a lawyer" speech. This is some civilian non-advice to make your research hold like cement in court, while you simultaneously protect yourselfs going foreword as a group of researchers. I can tell there is no chance in hell of stopping most of you, but I know enough to know when you're starting to step in some legal mud. Yesterday, I heard a rumor that one woman researching the part of this that is in Haiti, is now dead?  So, lets get some legal armor on. Lets have a tactical discussion. I think the six steps below are necessary at this point.
    </big>
   </p>
   <p>
    Situation summary:  IMHO everyone now needs good offensive and defensive tactical tools. We need serious preparation for what you may be heading into. Looking at your research trails, I suspect there is every chance that you may be on your way to uncovering something similar to the Franklin Cover Up, and other famous child slave trade nests of international significance that have been uncovered. The difference? I've been on the internet for 20 years. This is the first time I have seen multiple brilliant minds chasing this horror down with the righteous vengence it deserves. The researchers here may actually be sufficient to break open the heart of the international cartel of sex trafficing in children, and even women. If this happens, it will be sometning on the scale of the Nuremberg Trials. It's obviously international in scale.
   </p>
   <p>
    We will succeed only if we do it as a team and do it right. The suspicious death in Haiti is nothing new. John DeCamp,(military) and others ended up dead chasing this alone. Stay together as a group. It might be good to bring in the twitter army for a briefing They are being shadow banned on this subject, indicating that the criminals are going to give them a hard time too.  For years we the people have only been able to chip around the edges of this monster. These 6 helpful things came to me yesterday morning after sleeping on it.
   </p>
   <p>
    FIRST, EVERYONE who is collecting and archiving research trails, and "court worthy" evidence, needs to start to JOURNALIZE DAILY. This needs to be done in a diary that is resident on the computer, AND NOT ON THE CLOUD. (see link  for a good diary below) Please pass this info to the other researchers on this evidence chase.
   </p>
   <p>
    Right now, today, please go to this link and pick up this small transportable computer resident diary called iDailyDiary. USE THE FREE VERSION.... IT WILL NOT GET ON THE CLOUD. This diary is a way to archive what you find. It is very important to make sure you don't accidently "publish" to the cloud. Publication is key to accusations of the kinds of slander/libel cases we were warned of. Here is the link  http://www.splinterware.com/download/index.html   Again, use the free version. It will build portable dated solid courtroom evidence. Keep a copy of the actual diary.exe program on any jump drive you make This way, any prosecutor or judge can install the diary program along with the journal information. Once your archive is in writing, resident on your computer, where it cant be "dissapeared", it can't be accidently published,  and it makes SOLID evidence.
   </p>
   <p>
    SECOND: In addition to the journal, start saving the html pages of the web sites you find that you believe may be evidence in the future. Bring these down to your computer. Usually there is a "save page as" at the upper right/left of the browser. This process will save the html, but not the jpegs (photos) on the page. So in addition save each jpeg you need in the same folder as the html page it came from.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every day, in the diary, make a note of the name of the ARCHIVE FILE ( html/photo download files you created that day). This way, you can go to a date in your diary, and know where the files are that you made notes about on that day.  Make your comments/observations in the diary too. This will keep the research trails/archives in order, for the FBI and the JUDGE who will eventually need to be able to follow. (Good offence tactics start with this.... Dont make it hard for the judge/jury to understand or read).
   </p>
   <p>
    THIRD: For reasons that will become obvious below, backup  your diary, saved html pages, and saved photos. Do this once a week on a PORTABLE JUMP DRIVE (or two or three). Take at least ONE copy of your weekly research to a location that can not be raided with a warrant for search and seizure. If the worst happens, they will seize everything at your home and business. If the best happens, and we break this open, just about everyone will lose their computer as courtroom evidence in a a trial of international significance. (Knowing centipedes, you will be rewarded with a crowsourced replacement computer on the line of a Mercedes). But it would still be a good idea to back up what you dont want to lose now, in addition to the research archives.  If the hard drive with your family photo back up  is in your home it can also be seized. Make sure to take anything you want to save in the way of family photos, or a mirror of your drive... off of any of your personal premisis..
   </p>
   <p>
    FOURTH: Share your work, and archive each others work. Do this by taking screen shots of other researchers posts/archives on reddit and putting them in your diary on the day they happen. If you have time, make a second html/jpeg archive for them. This locks in MULTIPLE written testimonies about who was researching what, and when. We want redundant journalized  witness evidence.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now for Research DEFENCE tactics
Cross witnessing makes for good defence too:  If you are even accidently contaminated with pedophile jpegs while doing your research; If you find yourself in a court room someday defending yourself against a charge of pedophilia on line; it will be CRITICAL to have the Journal on the computer they seize, AND on a separate jump drive they can not seize.
   </p>
   <p>
    It will be helpful to have your reddit journal notes appear in the journals of other researchers who were working on the same case as you are. You are not a pedophile. But the places you may wind up on line could make your computer look like you are. You need to be able to prove to the jury that you are not. You need multiple witnesses, and it would be good to have those witnesses in writing (journalized). This is a "fight together or die separately" situation. You are pledging your lives and your fortunes as the founders would say. It is serious. Defend yourselves, and each other, daily. Start now.
   </p>
   <p>
    The  second worst case scenario: (worst case being Seth Rich):  Prosecutors will often give you a plea bargain that goes like this: "Admit being a pedophile, and we will jail you for 6 months to 5 years. If you don't take the plea bargain, we will hit you with one count for each photo, and that's say...17 years to life?" Get ready for this. Keep your research journals in a safe place that can not be taken with a warrant. Prosecutors might have them on your machine. You are supposed to be able to get things back during discovery. Prosecutors have a way of "losing" evidence that will clear your name if they are corrupt. Remember, we are dealing with severe government corruption at the moment. There is one more thing you can all do to defend yourselves and each other:
   </p>
   <p>
    FIFTH: Get to your local police department, and have a talk with that part of the department that deals with this kind of thing. Most departments have a domestic violence unit, something like that.  Make a friend out of a local officer with a long talk. Show them the research being done here on reddit. Ask them if they would take an extra copy of your research weekly into the evidence room. Tell them about your fear that the sites you all have to go to in order to get the evidence could accidently contaminate your computer with pedophilia one day.
   </p>
   <p>
    Remember. We just had an election where most police officers have voted for Trump. Many are aware of the wikileaks-podesta files. NOW is the time to talk to your locals if you want to continue this research safely, without future accusations, being "raided" in your home, or finding yourself in court/jail. Also, by talking to the locals, you can sum up the amount of help you will have if the jackals decide to do a drive by download of pedophilia over your wifi, then send off an anonymous letter to your local police. It's called being framed. Don't think they won't try. Lets get ready.
   </p>
   <p>
    SIXTH: Maybe we should crowd source an attorney for the research group.   Here is an idea we can borrow from the homeschoolers who were attacked by the courts. They each paid 100$  a year to keep the group attorney on retainer for all homeschoolers.  It worked fantastic, It is the reason homeschooling is still legal in America today There are .2 Scenarios and 2 good reasons for doing this in our situation:
   </p>
   <p>
    First case: One of our redditors is attacked in the courts as a pedophile because his computer was contaminated while doing research? If the group has an attorney on retainer through crowdsourcing, that attacked researcher has immediate "up to speed" legal counsil without worry. The attorney would be on retainer for all members of the research group. Judicial watch may be able to find us a good attorney. Hell, they may even BE our attorney. We should find out what it would cost, and try to crowd fund legal retainer help now. An attorney for the group would also be another place that the archives could be gathered, where evidence gathered can not be "raided" and stolen.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is another reason to crowd fund a good lawyer. We will need a reallly good attorney in the event that the unthinkable horrible fear we all have, .....actually happens. Some day, one of us may actually run into the real evidence of children being abused, or, heaven forbid, actually tortured/murdered. IF THAT HAPPENS, it would be good to have an attorney who is already up to speed. I trust Judicial watch to lead us in the right direction. Does anyone know someone there to talk to?
   </p>
   <p>
    Seventh: The slander issue. Keeping your important notes off line, off the cloud is important. Publication avoided, is slander/libel avoided. Making screenshots and on line archives of the actual web sites is acting like the "Wayback machine" so you are ok with web site archives. Its a diginal record of what people have already made PUBLIC, for you to comment on. It would be ok to highlight... draw arrows to things on the page and publish..  It's ok to state FACTUAL OBSERVATIONS about the public pages, that you have the evidence to prove.
   </p>
   <p>
    Public pages and Private people are different things all together.  For instance, if you state that Fred Smith owns both web sites, be able to prove it.  But, when it comes to private people, do not made accusations on line. It is not ok to call Fred a pedophile on line, because "your certain of it" without hard evidence to prove it.. Cuss them out in the diary all you want, If you are ready to puke from the visual horrors, go ahead and have a puke fest in your diary. What happens in the diary..... stays in the diary. And, your puke sick outrage, in your diary, is a pretty good measure of your NON pedo intent,  I might add.
   </p>
   <p>
    One last thought. Back up the things you want to keep, like family photos etc, now. IF your computer becomes criminal evidence, in a monster trial, you will lose things you want to keep, without backing them up. When you do this, say, on a hard drive? If the hard drive is in your home it can also be seized. Make sure to take anything you want to save in the way of family photos, or a mirror of your drive... off premisis..
   </p>
   <p>
    If we have any other legal minds here, please add anything I did not think of. This is an excellent team effort. I am not a "licensed" attorney, but I really want this to succeed. It looks like many lives may depend on our success. Lets build a good case. Lets watch our backs as best we can.

    I'm a bit wary of the "archive all your super damning evidence that you wont post to this specific link." Convince me you aren't a pedo sympathizer referring us to intelligence gathering software.

     Agreed, be skeptical of any links/downloads. Operate on the assumption that anything you post or use online is ultimately not yours.  And OP, where do you get all this detailed info from? I highly doubt they teach you this stuff in law school and you've obviously not practiced in court since you're not licensed....

     The link is to free software to catalog all of your research in a coherent manner. You don't have to back anything up online. It's really not a bad idea, I'm going to check it out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Edit: if you are really that concerned, install on a device with no network connections.

    What if, the MAIN reason CP is illegal to view is because you'll find pictures of rich elites in them?
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit: we MAY need to delve deeper - as in DEEPWWW to find specific evidence. I've never been-my internet is weak in AK and I don't possess the savvy, but I've heard rumors; if we're going to break this case a few of us may need to sacrifice their innocence...
We'd be looking for identifiable marks on adults: tattoos/scars...

    This is a great post. Thank you for posting this info. This is very important now that we know some sites are being scrubbed, so having the html files, time stamped, is critical. Also the sharing and backing up of each others work creates a network that can't be simply suicided off or targeted with fake charges (a la Assange, Jacob Applebaum, etc). When everyone is working toward a common goal, any attempt to remove one person would be much less effective.
   </p>
   <p>
    Seriously, this is one of the most helpful "meta" post I have seen.
