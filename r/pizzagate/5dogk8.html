    thought it would be a good idea to try to attack our
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dmdoo/warning_someone_posted_link_to_rpizzagate_on/">
     thread
    </a>
    . But instead of welcoming questions, they just deflected &amp; pulled the race/gender/religion card.
   </p>
   <p>
    https://www.reddit.com/user/tardbuster had tons of downvotes for their ridiciouls comments, but if you refresh their page now, theyre downvotes are turning into upvotes. It appears Amanda connections are helping her out right now by trying to sway the narratives on our threads.
   </p>
   <p>
    But they are just making it worse and more obvious for themselves, so don't give up redditors, they are in full panic mode. Keep talking about pizzagate, keep posting to other subs and point out the censorship and fake upvotes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Don't give up, they can't silence us all. &amp; the fact that they are being so defensive shows we are very close.

    That isn't so much being compromised as being brigaded, which is a classic CTR tactic.

     I wouldn't worry too much about ctr. Just look at how that election turned out for them. xD

    I knew something was up when this person showed up to "debunk" a post about taking care of yourself so this research doesn't hollow you out. This whole wrinkle with Amanda Kleinman is bizarre. Onion headline would be Person Devoting Entire Life to Attracting Attention Through Shock Value Upset to Discover Most Attention Negative

    We should welcome this. It shows that there is a concerted effort to cover up, which is indicative that they are hiding something.
   </p>
   <p>
    That they are engineering votes in this manner is a form of cover-up and deflection, and is another piece of evidence to add to the mountain.
   </p>
   <p>
    These people are profoundly incompetent, so they don't understand how such shilling implicates them even more in the eyes of the public.
   </p>
   <p>
    If they were innocent, they would open up the doors of Comet Ping Pong and Tony Podesta's home for white-glove inspection and DNA analysis in every nook and cranny (including whatever is beneath), the "day care" centers would be searched thoroughly, they would disclose their travel logs, they would address all of the details, etc. etc.
   </p>
   <p>
    Instead they are either unresponsive, or deceitful (it's all a "right wing conspiracy theory"), or involved in organized efforts to cover up everything (deleting their online records, artificially engineering upvotes, etc), which is a sign of guilt.

    Doesn't really matter. His arguments are based on fallacies and hold no traction here.
