        <strong>FBI has shut down the NYPD investigation, confiscated Weiners laptop, and is blocking the NYPD from making any arrests in the Weiner “sexting” case involving an underage 15-year-old girl.</strong>

        <p><p>They have copies of these files.</p>
<p>The NYPD saw this coming from miles away, you can absolutely bet on it. These people aren't stupid, and they KNEW they had to back this stuff up when they saw the severity of the contents.</p>
<p>They knew there would be relentless attempts at a cover up, but no matter.</p></p>

        <p><p>Would love a source, to help me sleep at night that we'll someday get to see what was on that laptop. Do you have a reliable one stating that they copied it and the FBI didn't get to it too?</p></p>

        <p><p>My source is the understanding that these people are much more in the know than us, and have various connections that we just don't have. Other departments around the country, the intelligence agencies, military, people like that. Trump is VERY close with many Generals in our military. They know what is going on, and right now is the big push to take back the country it looks like.</p>
<p>The media has conditioned us to not make connections, and if we did, told us that the connections we made were not good enough. That is obviously a lie. The media has attempted to kill all critical thinking throughout the years. They were fine when they first started out more or less, but other parties with a lot of money slowly infiltrated them, as well as the government.</p>
<p>They're all working behind the scenes to not only oust the corruption within their own ranks, but they are coordinating for a larger scale takedown of the corruption that has plagued this country for 3 decades. The majority of humans are intelligent.</p>
<p>The perpetuation that everyone was stupid was just another tool to push a divide between people with differing opinions. This grew into a narrative that everyone was stupid because of their knowledge, not opinion. That is extremely dangerous, as it hinders progress in the form of hindering the spread of factual knowledge. True factual knowledge knows no bias. Military knows it, that's the only reason they can operate at all.</p>
<p>By creating this narrative, they hinder progress by not allowing people to work together. The stuff we could accomplish with today's levels of technology when working together? It would be a new age of tech progress.</p>
<p>They're not going to publicly announce their plans or what they will do until immediately before they take action.</p>
<p>Hope I helped put you at ease a little by expanding on my thoughts.</p></p>

        <p><p>I posted this on /r/conspiracy, but I think it could be useful here as well... a lot of people think this situation is hopeless... they need to know everything is gonna be fine... better than fine. </p>
<p>The FBI has always existed in a world where a file could be shredded, or evidence could be lost. The chain of command prevented any agent from really knowing too much about the big picture... your case could be handed off to "someone else" and that would be the end of it. The agents only really communicated with their superiors and a few people in the office.</p>
<p>Now we live in a world where instead of being shredded that same file can be instantly duplicated a million times and flung across the entire globe in a split second... agents can communicate and coordinate without relying upon the old chain of command... a single pipeline of info is easy to cut off... but a web of information shared can let the good ones piece together the whole thing without tipping off the few corrupt ones in control.</p>
<p>A suspicious suicide in a local newspaper would hit a readership of 3,000 and be lining the birdcage the next day... lost forever. Now it is preserved online and shared with anyone interested to look at it. They got away with this type of shit for so long by hiding each puzzle piece as it came into play. Now is the first time in history that we can all collectively gather enough pieces of the puzzle so we can put together the big picture. Sure there are a few pieces missing here and there... but enough of it is intact that you can step back and soak it all in.</p>
<p>I honestly believe we are witnessing something major here... something beautiful... I don't want people feeling scared or angry... I want them to kick back and enjoy the show, we are about to witness history in the making... The good people in the FBI have been working 100 times harder than us at /r/conspiracy &amp; /r/wikileaks &amp; /r/pizzagate have been... trying to unravel these mind boggling mysteries... only they have been training all their lives for this and they have tools and powerful connections at their disposal way beyond Google and Safari... and look at what we all have done with just those.</p>
<p>The FBI does have a shady history, but that is all about to change... the good guys are sick of looking like dirtbags because of the greed of a minority in power. These men risk their lives to do what is right... some fat fucker behind a desk can't stop them anymore.</p></p>

        <p><p>You totally get it. We are experiencing a shift of power. It is happening all over the world, the US isn't even the first one to begin shifting. Brexit, South Korea, France soon, and others are all part of this movement.</p>
<p>I heard that this can be attributed to pendulum theory, which is a political theory that when government goes too far left, the pubic will correct this in the most extreme manner. By that I mean; extremely effective. The changes will happen QUICK once Trump takes office.</p>
<p>The most powerful country in the world going through this shift means that the rest of the world is quickly going to follow suit. It is a very pivotal point, and indicates a sort of critical mass being reached.</p></p>

        <p><p>Exactly... all the planets have aligned... the conditions are finally perfect for change to happen... real change. I dunno where all this money they steal is going... but I feel like a lot of it is coming back to the ones that deserve it. People will make sure this type of widespread bullshit won't happen again for a couple of centuries. </p></p>

        <p><p>A lot of those assets are soon to be forfeited back to the US government. Restitution payments for their crimes. </p>
<p>edit - Dammit you edited yours and now it sounds like I was saying that we'd get to divvy up the kiddies. </p>
<p>Whoa... now that makes me think... there is gonna have to be a lot of serious effort spent to get these "orphans" to the point where they even have a remote hope of living a normal adult life... especially if they've been brainwashed. I logiced myself into a huge bummer there... just another day in the rabbithole. </p></p>

        <p><p>god that picture is weird. it's so random too. i want to think it's just an unfortunate still, but his hand is still where it is. and in simple body language... i actually just deleted my last sentence, as i look at it, it's increasingly unsettling. i really can't find the words to match my emotions.</p>
<p>whoever began circulating that picture is a skilled persuader. it managed to create a visceral response in me, and i'm not the type to have that.</p></p>

        <p><p>I felt exactly the same way when I saw it, so I knew it was probably important to spread. The body language is just too obvious to ignore. I also looked at it in photoshop, nothing looks out of the ordinary. This image is legit.</p></p>

        <p><p>The image was scrubbed from the internet. It only resurfaced again within the last couple weeks. Can't find it anywhere but these circles; however we need to spread it now.</p>
<p>I showed a friend at work. Holy shit he's SO far stuck in his own world that <em>he didn't see anything wrong.</em> I was hoping to actually introduce him to the various links and facts regarding Obama and his ties to these people, but in his mind, as long as he disproves one of my points, he doesn't have to look into anything else. He's actually never disproven many of my points though.</p>
<p>Then he sends me those two images of Trump and Ivanka. Sure they're slightly suggestive, but <em>it's his daughter.</em></p>
<p>Then he's like Trump said "If I wasn't married, I would be dating her."</p>
<p>Then I corrected him: "I'd probably be dating Ivanka if she wasn't my daughter." &lt;-- that's the correct quote. He's proud of his daughter.</p>
<p>I think he automatically assumes I am always wrong and formulates his arguments with that bias. He's going to have such a rude awakening soon. I think he sees the writing on the wall, but is very stuck in his worldview. He won't even inform himself about the wikileaks.</p>
<p>At this point, anybody who hasn't looked in the wikileaks has no idea how this country is run.</p></p>

        <p><p>Thank you for your response!  It's so true about what you said RE: your co-worker as an example.  I think most, not all, are like that. Some are just too lazy to do the research, and some basically chose to be ignorant. I believe to be Informed, you gotta be involved. But, yeah.. the writing is definitely on the wall.</p>
<p>And about that picture?  I cringe while looking at it! Its too intimate.. not natural at all!  I have reposted it in Twitter and on FB. (Not that I trust either of those because of who they are run by). Like you said, some people are stuck in their worldviews and can't or won't bring themselves to see the truth. But hopefully people like yourself and others who continue to share factual information will reach others who are still asleep, and open their eyes to whats really going on.</p>
<p>The Conspiracy Theorists =) have been vindicated in reguards to current government and where the US and the World was headed if HRC was chosen President. Thanks to Assange and Wikileaks, the Whistleblowers, and even those who have died to expose the truth to the people. We were given the truth to change the outcome! =)</p>
<p>Keep up the fight my friend, and I hope you and yours have an amazing weekend!  </p></p>

        <p><p>What is the only way to take down a powerful secret society? With an even bigger more powerful more secretive society... That is what the good men and women of the FBI/CIA/DOJ/PDs have all been working towards for a very long time... Only once their job is finally done and there is no more reason for secrecy will the rest of us be initiated to the club. </p></p>

        <p><p>I'm sure they know this already to some degree, but if that's the way things pan out, they'll truly be seen as the good guys by ordinary salt-of-the-earth people across the globe. I realllllly hope the trash gets cleared up!</p></p>

        <p><p>Mitt for sec State?!?  This alone lends me to believe you outside of My Happy Space.  I've been HOPING this is being slow played since FBI Anon taught us.  In my happy conspiracy theory, Mitt is being Vetted because he is A-Qualified, and B-Not Compromised by Pizzagate.  Look for all of the Cabinet choices to be 'odd' picks or political outsiders.  I reckon the list of Non-Pedos to pick from is limited. </p></p>

        <p><p>You're still falling into the trap. The MSM has conditioned you to believe that you cannot make these connections based on connecting facts, yourself.</p>
<p>Trump knows what Hillary is guilty of. Fact. Trump knows many generals and has spoken with them often. Fact.</p>
<p>There is only one conclusion that one can come to when knowing these facts. Also, the military isn't stupid. They saw the wikileaks too, as well as other inside information that you will never know exists until this story is blown wide open.</p>
<p>If you have any issues with the logic I used to come to this conclusion, you are welcome to refute it.</p></p>

<p>I do believe you though. It just isn't a stretch for me to believe that someone like yourself, who knows people in the NYPD, would've come here - because the NYPD is watching all this as well.</p></p>

        <p><p>Could taking the evidence away from the NYPD have anything to do with how Presidential pardons work. It is my understanding that a Presidential pardon is good for federal offenses only. So even if Obama issued pardons, those receiving the pardons would still be subject to state charges. By taking Weiner's laptop, they prevent the state from being able to prosecute based on the evidence on the laptop.  So a pardon plus lack of the laptop would let them walk free at both the federal and state level. </p>
<p>Also, am I correct thinking the Presidential pardon applies only to people. If so, using that wonderful asset forfeiture law (which I despise), law enforcement entities could still go after their assets and those of the foundation since forfeiture laws are allowed to assume property is guilty until proven innocent. </p></p>

<p>The president can only pardon those convicted of a federal crime. Please use google and don't spread misinformation :/</p></p>

        <p><p>But he doesn't have to specify WHICH federal crime.  Which was my point..</p>
<p>edit: also he can grant clemency which is effectively a pardon to anyone for any crime.</p></p>

        <p><p>1.) We already know congress has copies of the emails. Why isn't that mentioned in the article?</p>
<p>2.) Anytime you see 'News Site X Has Confirmed' with no other sources, it is fake news. Also, any site that references Buzzfeed in its articles is fake news as well.</p></p>

        <p><p>disinfo. this entire sub is disinfo. it makes me mad to have become involved in this. for every real post from someone who cares about children and dismantling the pedophilia rings within the elite class... there are 10 posts to discourage and misdirect. and another 10 to directly attack the victims of ritual sexual abuse. cathy o'brien's entire life is a shining example. hillary clinton's lifelong commitment to silencing the victims of sexual abuse is another.</p>
<p>watching the disinfo on this sub is a fucking farce. it's so easy to tell who's responding to themselves to create a corroborating narrative. i'm full on done with this, reddit is good for nothing other than memes and trolling liberal weirdos. trump won, we good.</p></p>

        <p><p>No it won't.  You must not be aware of what happened the first week of November.  The FBI released their FOIA documents so people would know the rules.  I could be wrong, but what I gathered was.. if 3 people make the same FOIA request they have to release it without notifying their superiors.  and it was happening the same day.  If there's something you want to get from them, just get a few people to request it with you.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, I remember that.  My interpretation was that is was a mini revolt within the FBI.  Are you saying this will be the standard procedure from now on?  If so, I really hope you are right.  We need people in the FBI, CIA, and NSA to start leaking so we can effectuate the change that needs to happen.  </p></p>

<p>You are 100% correct. It's why we got a flood of information during the weeks leading up to election.</p></p>
