<p><p>I have no idea why he made this tweet, or why Potato Head is in the emails.</p>
<p>I just figured out that in, let say historic context, it means some parts are lacking.</p>
<p>But, it would explain why he's so pissed off.</p></p>

<p><p>could you elaborate on the last bit? sorry if being slow not seeing link.
another way i interpret this is if hes lacking bits (ie neutered) then he cant commit pedophilia, right? </p></p>

<p><p>I think what we are seeing is vocalized in the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>.  Picture an elite sloshing a beer, singing that song, while at the Bohemian Grove.  What is that song about?</p>
<p>I think we are looking at the mechanism, or the side effects, of the control system.</p>
<p>You catch a young person in college committing a crime, give them a second chance, but with consequences for failure.  Make the dress in drag to prove they are still going along.</p>
<p>Why does everyone in DC fall into line at the drop of a dime?  I think this is somehow related, and pizzagate is a symptom of the people there.</p>
<p>Just speculation, but this would answer some questions.</p></p>

<p><p>You know I always wondered why Chaffetz and Gowdy were the only ones to ever speak out about anything. Found this interesting link http://boards.cindysbeentrippin.com/t/wait-what-mr-potato-head-aka-trey-gowdy-uses-his-own-private-email-server/11154.</p>
<p>"Dear Chairman Gowdy:</p>
<p>I noted with interest your public demand that Secretary Clinton turn over her personal email server, presumably so that the committee can access some 30,000 Clinton emails deemed to be strictly private and beyond the reach of the government.</p>
<p>This Orwellian demand has no basis in law or precedent. Every government employee decides for themselves what email is work-related and what is strictly private. There is no reason to hold Secretary Clinton to a different standard— except partisan politics.</p>
<p>But since you insist that Clinton’s private email be accessed, I’m writing today to ask you and your staff to abide by the same standard you seek to hold the Secretary to by releasing your own work-related and private email and that of your staff to the public.</p>
<p>While I realize that Congress regularly exempts itself from laws that apply to the executive branch, I believe this action is necessary to ensure public confidence in the fairness and impartiality of your investigation.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>David Brock
Correct The Record"</p>
<p>Lol look at this ridiculous letter from David Brock (assuming it's real), and the poster on this forum seems to know about the Potato Head reference. Anyways if anyone's not up to speed David Brock and James Alefantis were former lovers and had some sort of law suit settlement between them. James Alefantis of course is the owner of Comet Ping Pong.</p></p>

<p><p>I think it's more along the lines that if you go against the cabal's narrative, they'll make you pay. I'm guessing they already dealt with Chaffetz and Comey in that way, and now they don't have much more to lose at this point so they're always going after Hillary. The politicians are just pawns taking orders, these people have ways of controlling them.</p>
<p>Just speculating of course.</p></p>

</p>
<p><p>but in what way do you think they dealt with them in such a way that would "put them in their place" yet at same time not scare them enough to stop them from speaking out?</p>
<p>if they threatened their family for example then the danger is still there (unless e.g. the relative died so no more leverage etc - perhaps worth seeing if either have lost relatives recently).</p>
<p>i would have to say that if they were controlled opposition they might have done a bit too much damage.</p></p>

<p><p>Check out the Franklin Coverup thing a couple threads up, it probably goes down something like this http://imgur.com/a/12mp2. 
NSFL btw, but good insight into how these people seem to operate</p></p>

<p><p>The answer in the form of a question....</p>
<p>What is the method to control 500+ members of Congress, A-list actors, Supreme Court Justices, and CEOs?</p></p>
