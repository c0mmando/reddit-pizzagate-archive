    Thought this was different than most posts but I remember watching this episode back in August. Corey Feldman wants to come forward with information but is still apprehensive. Number 2 and 3 read as follows:
2. Tyler Henry connected with Corey Feldman's best friend: Afterward, Corey handed Tyler a chain with a ring attached and he immediately felt the presence of someone who would have passed away from a drug overdose. Tyler had no idea who it was, but Feldman confirmed it was his close friend, late actor Corey Haim. "It all makes perfect sense really what you just described," he said.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tyler explained that Haim was referencing to the writing of a book and encouraging Feldman to share more details about the suffering and abuse he endured during his life as a child star. "I know that I care," Feldman said. "I know that I want to do everything that I can to help others, but it's a lot or responsibility and it does have its own level of very intense and very real danger attached to it."
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     Tyler Henry advised Corey Feldman on coming forward about Corey Haim's abuse: "The individual that's being referred to clearly had lots of opportunities to interact with kids," Tyler told him. "All it will take is one person coming forward for a whole other group of people to come forward. It's clear that other people would also come forward and support you."
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Feldman felt this was the reassurance he was hoping for. "Literally, I've been praying for several nights in a row for this answer," he said. "I feel like that whole thing was orchestrated by some greater power to help me find that answer."

    Corey Feldman has been speaking out about the issue for several years now. Apparently both he and Corey Haim were  molested by producers on the set of stand by me.

     He very nearly spilt the beans on who did it earlier this year, then was quickly silenced under the pretense that it was irrelevant and Feldman was "mocking" Haim's legacy.
    </p>

     The suggestions ranged from Charlie Sheen, to Steven Spielberg, to both of the big Toms (Hanks and Cruise), and everyone else in between.

      Somebody should tweet him and just ask. My money is he knows exactly what this is all about.

      Sheen was probably also abused and he and Cory had a relationship...the other one has to be Spielberg...jaysus.

    Perhaps start by looking at Feldman's filmography from the 80s and narrowing down the recurring names? Like directors, producers, casting agents?

     I think that's wasted time. If we keep digging and expanding, some Hollywood names will cross over with Pizzagate. If this stuff creeps into public knowledge and there's some outrage, he could come out and put it over the top.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not shilling, just my two cents. Watched An Open Secret on Hollywood pedophile rings last week, very good insight into how it works.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just keep digging, whichever direction.

    Corey Feldman once retweeted this video ("Charlie Sheen: Satanic Ritual Abuser") and later deleted the tweet.

    Someone reach out to these kinds of people and get them to leak some information. Never make the source public just put the leads out for us. Just a few fresh leads could crack this shit wide open.
