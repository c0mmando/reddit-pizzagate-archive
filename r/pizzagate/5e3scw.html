   <p>
    Thread repeat below:
   </p>
   <p>
    Reddit copy/pasta:
   </p>
   <p>
    Thread is becoming extensive so I will be recapping a short summary of the Ayala and Associates connections here:
   </p>
   <p>
    DoJ Andrew Kline had registered the business of UPTOWN PIZZA INC:
http://oi64.tinypic.com/2rfg188.jpg
   </p>
   <p>
    Noting it's address as being:
   </p>
   <p>
    '5029 Connecticut Ave., N.W.,
Washington, District of Columbia, 20008'
   </p>
   <p>
    Which is the same as Besta Pizza:
http://oi68.tinypic.com/2njc2l4.jpg
   </p>
   <p>
    With it's weird pizza symbol stylised after the boylove symbol:
http://oi63.tinypic.com/2wr3zht.jpg
   </p>
   <p>
    Doing a search on the Washington DC corporation registration site, I looked up businesses who had been registered by DoJ Andrew Kline:
http://oi67.tinypic.com/30xev48.jpg
   </p>
   <p>
    This pulled up three businesses. One of which was called Los Cuates Restaurant Inc:
http://oi67.tinypic.com/53rdlh.jpg
   </p>
   <p>
    Of these, I asked a friend to look into the email of the registered agent of Andrew Kline, which read "mvado@ayalapa.com".
   </p>
   <p>
    The address of the above registered agent was documented as being:
   </p>
   <p>
    '1225 19th Street, NW
Suite 320
Washington, District of Columbia, 20036'
   </p>
   <p>
    The email was connected to "ayalapa.com":
http://ayalapa.com/
   </p>
   <p>
    Ayala is the name, the PA stands for "Public Accountants".
   </p>
   <p>
    Of which company logo on the site...
http://oi68.tinypic.com/ht9o90.jpg
   </p>
   <p>
    ...contained the same boylove symbol as that as Andrew Kline's Besta Pizza, prior to it's mysteriously suspicious editing:
http://oi63.tinypic.com/11sftr8.jpg
   </p>
   <p>
    Looking into Ayala and Associates, we find the governor of such a place is one Felix Nelson Ayala:
http://oi66.tinypic.com/2cp43sl.jpg
   </p>
   <p>
    Searching through for businesses registered by Felix Nelson Ayala, I found this business called "Salvadoran American Chamber of Commerce of the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area Inc":
   </p>
   <p>
    http://oi66.tinypic.com/2v9av4p.jpg
http://oi68.tinypic.com/9v9hqb.jpg
   </p>
   <p>
    This also had the same address as the Syrian Advisory Center, among others:
   </p>
   <p>
    http://oi65.tinypic.com/152jrkk.jpg
   </p>
   <p>
    Curiously, this isn't Felix Nelson Ayala's only connection to Salvador [a known human trafficking hotspot]. One trademark under his name is "PRODUCTOS ACAJUTLA EL SALVADOR":
   </p>
   <p>
    http://oi66.tinypic.com/2hcq61e.jpg
   </p>
   <p>
    Furthermore, my friend found that Felix Nelson Ayala had backed Jim Graham:
   </p>
   <p>
    https://s12.postimg.org/xyv84ho7h/felix_nelson_ayala_1.jpg
   </p>
   <p>
    Jim Graham largely supports the LGBT community:
   </p>
   <p>
    "He is the second openly gay elected official in D.C., after David Catania."
   </p>
   <p>
    And has been part of numerous organisations... including a strip club:
   </p>
   <p>
    "
AIDS Action Council (previous Board member)
National Lesbian and Gay Health Foundation (previous Board member)
Coalition for Consumers Health and Safety
Washington AIDS Partnership (previous Advisory Committee member)
Concerned Citizens on Alcohol and Drug Abuse, Inc. (previous Advisory Board member)
National AIDS Network (previous Treasurer and Board member)[9]
Rock Hard DC Strip Club [10]
"
   </p>
   <p>
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Graham#Gay_community_pioneer
   </p>
   <p>
    Strip club article:
   </p>
   <p>
    "Gay former D.C. Council member Jim Graham (D-Ward 1), who lost his re-election bid just over a year ago, is helping the owner of a female nude dance club on Georgia Avenue transform the adult nightclub every Sunday night into a male strip club catering to a gay clientele."
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/04/16/jim-grahams-next-act-a-strip-club/
   </p>
   <p>
    This likely has something to do with the fact Felix Nelson Ayala owns a restaurant called "Divino Grill" that he had changed to include a "live drag show":
http://oi67.tinypic.com/jawght.jpg
   </p>
   <p>
    It also advocates a pro-gay message:
https://s18.postimg.org/7050mglt5/divino_grill.jpg
   </p>
   <p>
    Which is curious given the fact both Besta Pizza and Ayala and Associates have the "boylove" symbols - which is the pedophilia preference for boys (or male children). So the motivations are quite clear.
   </p>
   <p>
    They also failed to comply with the law, notably the lack of signs warning pregnant women of the harm of alcohol to the baby (which is curious given that Jim Graham is pro-abortion) and the lack of signs indicating the legal drinking age, suggesting alcohol was served to minors:
   </p>

   <blockquote>
    <p>
     DoJ Andrew Kline
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    That's not the one that registered Uptown Pizza LLC.
   </p>
   <p>
    The address listed on the LLC paperwork (19th St) is that of the Veritas Law Firm, which is where an Andrew Kline works. That Andrew Kline is not the one that worked for the Department of Justice. You can confirm this on the "Our Team" page for the Veritas Law Firm which includes a photo of "Andrew Kline" who looks nothing like the "Andrew Kline" that worked for the DOJ.
   </p>
   <p>
    In fact there are FIVE Andrew Kline's listed in the white pages within 20 miles of Washington DC.
   </p>
   <p>
    Make sure that you do not assume that there's only one person with any given name for a geographic area. You have to cross-reference more than just someone's name.
   </p>
   <p>
    It's also worth pointing out that we don't know the owner of Besta Pizza. An Attorney can file LLC paperwork as a proxy agent for the individual that actually owns the business. Andrew Kline was likely acting as a proxy agent, which makes sense given that he's also served as a legislative adviser to the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Mr. Kline also has extensive experience in commercial landlord and tenant law. He has negotiated retail leases for all manner of uses for both landlords and tenants with premises ranging from 500 to 50,000 square feet.

    <p>
     It's not as simple as you described, and I suspect you've missed a trick (I'm surprised no-one on reddit caught the Ayala stuff, but this isn't my first rodeo digging out dodgy businesses).
    </p>
    <p>
     The full address isn't "19th St"
    </p>
    <p>
     It's "1225 19th STREET, N.W. #320", and we can actually prove this one in particular belongs to Ayala and Associates more strongly than Veritas Law Firm (which appears to be a proxy company to Jecca Corporate Services).
    </p>
    <p>
     First, let's double check my research. I feel like you're insinuating that there are multiple Andrew Klines and thus insinuating that these restaurants aren't related, but had you checked my handiwork you know I hadn't missed a beat (remember, this is a condensed summary so people don't get lost on convoluted rabbit hole trips).
    </p>
    <p>
     If you double-check the Los Curates Restaurant screenshot, you'll see the registering agent address is the same as that as the Besta Pizza. We have to raise eyebrows because the email address we saw earlier associated with Besta Pizza and it's registering agent is the official internal email used by Ayala and Associates - and NOT Veritas Law Firm. This is our basis for proving Ayala and Associates involvement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Obviously, Los Curates/Besta Pizza have the same registering agent (the odds of two different Andrew Klines being at the same address is incredibly low). So we know they are connected.
    </p>
    <p>
     We can further verify this angle by checking into Ayala and Associates history. Immediately we know that they aren't based at the same address based on the webpage screenshot [address at the bottom left] (so the question is: why is their email even on the Besta Pizza registering agent? Hint: this system is designed to obsfucate).
    </p>
    <p>
     To answer this we need to go on a grand adventure of shell law firm digging.
    </p>
    <p>
     Firstly, a lot of people make the rookie mistake of assuming companies are only ever registered 1-to-1 to an address. I'm guessing you saw Veritas Law Firm being registered there and didn't look any further (IE a reverse address search). Companies that evade taxes or have their businesses handled by the same processing department often register multiple companies at the same address (quite common in tax havens like Jersey in the UK, for example). This isn't illegal: a lot of companies can have different departments or different trading operations at the same, large scale, address.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you did a search on the address of 1225 19th St etc you'll see that several companies reside there:
    </p>
    <p>
     https://www.bizapedia.com/addresses/1225-19th-street-nw-320-washington-district-of-columbia-20036.html
    </p>
    <p>
     One of which is a dubiously named "KRISHNA CORPORATION". This shell company is in turn registered by Jecca Corporate Services, who themselves have registered 473 companies (as of this time of writing). Several of which (including Jecca) were involved in an employment dispute with workers not getting paid properly (sound a bit like human trafficking/illegal alien exploitation to you?).
    </p>
    <p>
     Here, the Washington Post officially notes Jecca Corporate Services being based at the 1225 19th Street NW #320 address:

    </p>
    <p>
     As that's a legal document, it's legally binding, and must be legally compliant. So we know the address is legitimately associated to Jecca Corporate Services.
    </p>
    <p>
     So suddenly the Veritas Law Firm argument collapses. It's merely obscurantum.
    </p>
    <p>
     Veritas Law Firm, I believe, are no more, and used to be registered to Jecca Corporate Services. However, now they are know as "Veritas Licensing and legislative affairs", and are registered by... Jecca Corporate Services:

    </p>
    <p>
     This becomes quite humourous because it means Jecca Corporate Services registered multiple companies at it's own address knowing full well that, if it were a separate company, they would have a different address.
    </p>
    <p>
     To rub additional salt in the wound, Jecca Corporate Services went so far as to register a company called 'CONN COXTION':

    <p>
     If that isn't 'in your face' about the shell companies I don't know what is.
    </p>
    <p>
     I wouldn't take anything at face value in a pedo ring that intends to hide itself from view.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, last curious note: in the complaint, one of the plaintiffs is called... Bonifacio Ayala.
    </p>
    <p>
     Haven't yet managed to prove a link between Ayala and Associates and Bonifacio Ayala, but if that's merely coincidence, it's quite the striking one.

      Furthermore, we can infer I had hit upon something in the fact that Ayala and Associates' site went down barely a day or so after I had published the discoveries (not to reddit, my own forum). If they weren't involved, what's with the sudden disappearance of the site?
     </p>
     <p>
      Other points friends were casually investigating ended up disappearing as well. I would love to present reddit with a watertight case (I was hoping to fly under the radar, make a fully fledged argument by surprise), but it seems my investigation has been spotted, so I want to hand off to reddit (who has more manpower and more speed) to expand upon the investigation.
     </p>
     <p>
      I would have conveyed this point, however reddit censored the first thread where this was mentioned and I had to re-write from scratch.

      It's a little hard to be thorough when people keep deleting your research.

      According to their own website, they are located in Suite #320. So there are multiple registered businesses working out of that same office.
     </p>
     <p>
      None of what you have posted verifies that the Andrew Kline that used to work in the Department of Justice has also worked for either Veritas Law Firm or Ayala and Associates. That's all I wanted to point out. The pair of them have very different appearances and very different biographies.
     </p>

      I have also been unable to discern when "Uptown Pizza LLC" changed their business name to "Besta Pizza". Actual ownership of Besta Pizza is still seemingly impossible to verify.
