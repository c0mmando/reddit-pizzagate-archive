        <strong>This Howard University reporter knows more than she's saying about Comet Pizza in her November 2015 report.</strong>

        <p><p>She even gets the manager to discuss his "relationship" with his customers. "We look out for them and they look out for us." Very sketchy tangent he goes on from there.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yep, has zero to do with pizza, and then they cut straight to two young kids playing ping pong. :|</p>
<p>I hope someone has this video saved.</p></p>

        <p><p>Also noticed: "surrounded by many other businesses" cues to shot showing Besta Pizza storefront.  Of what relevance is that to the piece? I seriously wonder if the reporter is in on it and this is some sort of advertisement to be spread around to potential 'buyers'. The YouTube page is very scant, interesting.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is shady given the upload date, his talk about looking to local farms 3 and 6 months out and then she mentions the secret recipe.. so creepy in this context </p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, indeed. The weird cages at the beginning when the kids are playing ping pong are also a very unsettling juxtaposition.</p></p>

        <p><p>Plus - what kind of stupid dipshit doesn't know the seasonality of vegetables? Does one need 3 and 6 month notice of what's coming? Wouldn't you just go to the farmer's market and they say, "We have some fresh tomatoes," and you say, "Great! I'll take 10 pounds!" </p>
<p>For the love of all that is good and holy, the vegetables on pizza aren't that complicated!!!</p></p>

        <p><p>Look at the beginning and the very end of the report as well. She's implying something untoward about the pizza place. One wonders what she knows about what goes on there.</p></p>

        <p><p>Think about any normal restaurant that you're familiar with in the place you grew up. Now imagine them being interviewed and saying the shit this guy says... it's totally a sign, a hint, a nod. Soooo creepy. </p>
<p>It's borderline blatant, but totally under the radar because why would anyone suspect this place. It's only due to the Podesta emails that we see how blatant what he's saying really is.</p></p>

        <p><p>I find it interesting that this report is from over a year ago, well before this "conspiracy" was hatched by the leaking of the Podesta emails. And yet through heavy innuendo, it implies that this reporter has her own sources regarding the shady dealings at Comet Pizza. She might be a missing puzzle piece to this mystery.</p></p>
