        <strong>The GOLDBERG FAMILY FOUNDATION has alleged pedophile "heart" symbol, and is connected to NUMEROUS children's charities. [Its allegedly suggestive logo was on Terasol Restaraunt website - but has since been removed from that site]</strong>

        <p><p>This is from another site on How to Spot a Pedophile:</p>
<p>These images were discovered by undercover volunteers on a website created by online sexual predators, where they instruct young girls and children that sex with older men is natural and their parents are lying to them and cannot be trusted because they are possessive and don’t want their children to feel good.</p>
<p>It has been speculated by some around the net in discussion about these symbols that these meanings and even existence of the symbols are untrue, but those statements have been made by pedophiles whose primary goal it is to corrupt exposed discoveries about them. These people have often used these symbols on their own websites, and the jewelry is no figment of the imagination!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A heart within a heart, or “GLogo” “GirlLover” is used by pedophiles attracted to girls. The heart in a heart, to them, represents a adult/ female child relationship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A blue spiral-shaped triangle symbol, or “BLogo” “BoyLover”, symbolizes a boy (small triangle) surrounded by an older male (larger triangle)- and is meant to show adult/male child relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The butterfly CLogo a.k.a. “ChildLover” (commonly looks like four touching hearts) in pink/blue represents non-preferential gender pedophiles (girl or boy attracted, often both).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The yin-yang looking circle is CGlogo, used in reference to the website, Common Ground, which was created as a place for both girl and boy attracted pedophiles to meet and sympathize with each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pink/blue triangles is “AmaroSymbol” is a variation of the CGLogo.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently, I received a comment from a suspected pedophile bragging about the newest additions to their collections. These logos were not created by them but are already in place as innocent designs for unrelated issues. The purpose for using these common images is to fool society into not thinking twice when seeing someone wearing these items. In the words of the person who commented to me:</p>
<p>" We do not adhere strictly to the shapes you posted. We can modify them slightly and still recognize other girl and boy lovers. I am sure you have seen the new necklace designed by Jane Seymour. You probably have a pendant of your own. The ladies like them. So do little girls and little girl lovers. When asked about mine and why I wear a bit of woman’s jewelry, I say it is a reminder of my dead wife and child. Don’t you know, people don’t like talking to widowers because it is a sore subject. They would rather change the subject fast, and so I escape further prying into my necklace that signals other girl lovers that I am a GL. For my BL attraction, I don the wiccan triple knot. I know too of GLs who use the Roxy surfer girl heart logo and BLs who use the pagan vaulknot. These are both variations of the GL heart logo and the BL triangle logo but the public will never know the difference."</p>
<p>Pedobear is said to have originally begun as a way for young members of chan sites (4chan, 7chan, 12chan…) to call attention to pedophiles in their midst pretending to be kids to get their information. The pedophiles have since adopted Pedobear as their symbol of pride on the chan sites, claiming that the invention of the bear is a “loving gesture” toward them.</p>
<p>There are also abbreviations you should be aware of. The intention is to classify their interests for other pedophiles within their ring:</p>
<ul>
<li>AoA: Short for “age of attraction” meaning the age groups of children they are attracted to</li>
<li>MAA: Minor attracted adult (used in reverse of the word “pedophile”, though it is the same and places the child as responsible for the abuse)</li>
<li>AoC: Age of (legal) consent</li>
<li>CL: ChildLover/pedophile</li>
<li>GL: Girl Lover/Attracted to girls</li>
<li>BL: BoyLover/Attracted to boys</li>
<li>YF: Young Friend, used when speaking about a victim</li>
<li>CP: Child Porn (Which could mean anything from photos of naked or half-naked children to photos of actual child rape/torture)</li>
<li>LG: Little Girl</li>
<li>LB: Little Boy</li>
<li>GM: Girl Moment – which is time spent with a young girl (that can either be a passing second consisting of nothing more than a glance or a smile, or a lengthy visit with a girl);</li>
<li>BM: Boy Moment – same as Girl Moment</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there are the chats, or message boards:</p>
<ul>
<li>CG: known as Common Ground, a place for pedophiles of both preferences. Common ground, while being the one that touts of being for “all” pedophiles is less used than either of the other forums:</li>
<li>GC: GirlChat- for those that favor victimizing girls</li>
<li>BC: BoyChat- for those that favor victimizing boys</li>
</ul>
<p>and Pedophile Organizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>NAMBLA: North American Man/Boy Love Association</li>
<li>IBLD: International Boy Love Day – this is an actual Pedophile Holiday celebrated by them on June 23 of each year.</li>
<li>Newgon: Pedophile version of Wikipedia</li>
<li>CLOMA: Child Love Online Media Activism</li>
</ul></p>

        <p><p>I'm really thinking this is a stock image and it does not have anything to do with pizzagate. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/esq65">Take a look at my google reverse image search</a> and try it for yourself.</p></p>

        <p><p>Or everyone is a pedophile...
I could see some people at first glance just thinking ok a heart = love and compassion and then helping little kids = big hand and little hand. I'm sure the use of it in some instances may be in reference to pedophilia but it could be easily misinterpreted to those that do not know the background.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes. Hearts and stylized hearts are going to be very commonly used in children's organizations, because to most people they represent in that context compassion and caring. So there will be many many innocent organizations that will use this symbol, in addition to the few that may be up to bad things.</p></p>

        <p><p>https://www.google.com/search?q=Jane+Seymour+necklace&amp;client=ms-android-sprint-us&amp;prmd=sinv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2jq-9nL3QAhXhzIMKHaelDt8Q_AUICCgC&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=560</p>
<p>This is the Seymour necklace he refers to. It's very common. Many people may not realize the double meaning.  The question is did Seymour intend it or did they hijack the design</p></p>
