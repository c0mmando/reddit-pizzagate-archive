    Article from 2008 about Frank Winstead accusing Comet Ping Pong of encouraging murders rapists
   </strong>

   </p>
   <p>
    Someone posted and interview James Alefantis did on Yahoo. In it, he mentioned Transformer DC several times so I checked it out.
   </p>
   <p>
    Under the
    <a href="http://transformerdc.org/news/current-news">
     News
    </a>
    section was a post in September from a sight called
    <a href="https://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/transformer-dc-turns-fifteen-this-season">
     Brightest Young Things
    </a>
    (wtf is with the creepy blood dripping from the top of the page)
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     One of the articles is called
     <a href="https://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/from-ping-pong-pizza-to-rape-murder">
      From Ping Pong &amp; Pizza to Rape &amp; Murder
     </a>
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    In this article, it links to another story called
    <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/news/city-desk/blog/13055232/confronting-frank-winstead">
     Confronting Frank Winstead
    </a>
    which is from
    <strong>
     June 24, 2008!!
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     FTA: Frank Winstead: Folk hero to some, YouTube vigilante to others, and a total mystery to the press. The advisory neighborhood commissioner has made a name for himself by turning the ping-pong action in front of Comet into a grainy snuff film, and by referring to such ping-pong action as a short swat away from murder and rapes.

     I got excited about this video at first, but it's actually just this guy Frank Wintesad concerned about people playing ping pong outside. However, this was a year before the article, so maybe noticing the activity out front got him to start digging deeper

     A lot of my thinking had to do with people talking about how they hide things in public view through art. When I saw the video on yahoo (sorry can't find the link/post) Alefantis talked a lot about this Transformer DC place which is an art center. He's also on the board of directors for Transformer

     He has a youtube account
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/fwinstead/videos">
      Frank Winstead
     </a>
    </p>
    <p>
     He looks more like a concerned citizen than anything according to his posts.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'd like to find out more about the meeting where he made the outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
     It says it happened during an ANC meeting (Advisory Neighborhood Commission?) Would there be minutes kept for this meeting somewhere?
    </p>
    <p>
     EDIT: Apparently he was an ANC Commissioner
Also, i believe thi is his

    I found out that Frank Winstead should be in ward 3F according to his address that was listed in the article.
   </p>
   <p>
    I wonder if there's any way to get the minutes of the meeting that occurred some time around June 24, 2008.
   </p>
   <p>
    Most public meetings keep minutes don't they?
   </p>

    Edit: [Advisory Neighborhood Commissions] (http://anc.dc.gov/page/advisory-neighborhood-commission-3f)
