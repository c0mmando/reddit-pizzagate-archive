   <strong>
    Info on Clement Freud connection to Podesta bros?
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I just read something last night or this morning regarding a connection between Freud and John and Tony Podesta, including emails that confirm they had use of his Portugal villa around the time of Madeleine McCann's disappearance. When I tried to relocate the thread it was nowhere to be found. Does anyone have more info on this?
Edit: I think I found what I was looking for.  Will post a link to this subreddit.

     I agree, which is why I've posted asking for any info on it. I've been looking for the thread for a while now to no avail. I plan to continue looking but if anyone finds anything before I do please post

      Is it not in your browser history? Even if it was deleted your history might show the title of the thread or something. Maybe it was cross-posted

       I've looked in both my chrome history as well as the history within my reddit app.  It's literally nowhere to be found.  All I remember is that it included a wikileaks email about "clem", had the explanation of Clement Freud, and the picture of everyone sitting around in the room with cards.

        I still do not see anything confirming that Podestas were in Portugal on the 3rd. That is what we need.
       </p>
       <p>
        I cannot find the contact info for the website you posted. They mention that they have confirmed it via an FBI insider, but then that means we just have to take their word for it -- which is not good evidence.

there is something here that is linking them but not the thread you are searching for. 
EDIT: added a link

     Thank you.  You're right, it's not what I'm looking for, but it is something.  I'm still searching through all of my devices in the faint hope I can find it (it was extremely comprehensive, too) but I have no idea where it might have gone.
It's possible my VPN kicked on and started up incognito browsing while I was researching.  Otherwise, would a deleted thread show up in my history?

    Get this- Freud had "a passion for ping-pong"!!! :

   </p>
   <p>
    Also was friends with known paedophile entertainer Rolf Harris and has authored some odd-looking books:

    Seems to be nothing. The link refers to an email but searching the podesta emails for Clem gets 2 results - neither of any significance
