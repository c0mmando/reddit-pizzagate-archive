        <p><p>Not sure if this warrants a new post or not... At least, it shows that we are being paid attention to.</p>
<p>Also, I wanted to point out that another of the 5 pictures in the, current, Looky Looky album is this http://archive.is/HpGH8/image. Cement for plastic models, of which the MSDS (http://www.rustoleum.com/MSDS/ENGLISH/3501X.pdf) states "may cause drowsiness or dizziness" (section 2, H336 in the MSDS sheet). </p>
<p>So a tube of glue would most certainly fit in the tubing connected to the mask as seen in OP. This could all mean nothing and not be connected, but I wanted to get it out there and hear some other opinions. </p>
<p>Why someone would put this on their facebook? I don't have a good answer for that other than they are a strange band, or they are trying to appeal to their demographic in some way. </p>
<p>Lastly. This, http://archive.is/yj68o/image, is another pic in the same Looky Looky album. Doesn't really connect to the other 2 I posted, but is still weird nonetheless.</p></p>

        <p><p>That last one is so creepy. What I don't understand is if these people are involved in this ring, why in gods name would they post photos on social media that are even remotely incriminating? Why wouldn't they steer clear of anything child-related on their social media so as to avoid suspicion?</p></p>

        <p><p>They are proud of their actions and like to hide in plain sight. It's a showing off, "look how clever and untouchable I am" thing. Sick.</p></p>

        <p><p>The only thing I can think of is to attract people with similar interests, with hopes that anyone else would just dismiss it as weird but not suspicious. </p></p>

        <p><p>I think the reason you are seeing these people slip up is because these are not people that are in the elite circles they are providing "art" and shit to.  They are simply outsiders with similar twisted interests and thus they don't have as much on the line or feel like they need to be as careful.  If we assume that this fucked up pedophilia is something for the uber elite, wealthy, and powerful then it may just be an ego thing where they want to show that they have made it, despite being a shitty weird band.  That is why I think you see all these small potatoes with IG/tumblr/FB posts that are incriminating.</p></p>

        <p><p>Looking at it again, I think you are right. Near her neck it looks like maybe some gauze and medical tape. Not sure what the red wire would be to. </p></p>

        <p><p>My mom is saying that there is no reason to have a red wire like that. An IV doesn't pull blood like that, and that looks more like something that would be near an IV back on the machine controlling the pump that pushes the medicine through the IV.</p>
<p>So, it's more likely an electrical cord? She is saying maybe having to do with the fact they like to shock and torture these kids. It's a possibility.</p></p>

        <p><p>I would not rule it out by any means. Maybe some time of heart or lung monitoring hardware? Looks like the cord goes to the child's right chest/side. Could your mom weigh in on that?</p></p>

        <p><p>Those methods are used to check for sleep apnea .. I know this because when my son was 6 he had to spend the night in the hospital with all those monitors taped to his chest etc.. and a mask like that . But * that does not look like a proffessional job . Nor does it look like a hospital ..?!?!</p></p>

        <p><p>The neck thing is from a central line. I have had numerous of these because of Shitty veins. It gives access directly to the jugular. Easier to use than an iv</p></p>
