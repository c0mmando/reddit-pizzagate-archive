        <strong>I don't have time to write a lot about this but I just want to put it out there</strong>
        <p><p>I was uploading some pictures relating to this is an album on imgur but then it stopped working which spooked me a little bit. I started wondering about Sasha Lord, the woman whose birthday it is in the video from the comet pizza and who the woman in the video calls their lord and saviour. </p>

<p>This is her twitter account. I started looking at some of the bands she is promoting and a lot of them have clear satanic themes.</p>

<p>Death Valley Girls playing at the Comet. Look at their video "Disco" Who wouldn't want this band at an all ages family friendly pizza place?</p>

<p>Got me looking at the director, Kansas Bowling. Research her story, weird story indeed.</p>
<p>Her Instagram page, lots of satanic symbols:</p>
<p>https://www.instagram.com/kansasbowling/</p>
<p>Her younger sister Parker Love Bowling: </p>
<p>Made this film: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.C._Butcher</p>
<p>Features sacrifice, cannibalism and more.</p>
<p>Her boyfriend! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Bingenheimer</p>
<p>The company that released the film:</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troma_Entertainment</p>
<p>Also released this film: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Sucking_Freaks
Some of the torture methods depicted fictionally in the film include the use of thumb screws, a skull crushed by a vise, amputation at the wrist by a bone saw, the amputation of fingers by a meat cleaver, electro-shock, suspension, the extraction of teeth, the portrayal of an electric drill through a skull with the brains sucked through a straw, the amputation of feet by a chainsaw, stretching on St. Andrew's Cross, caning and subsequent decapitation by guillotine, as well as brainwashing, whipping, darts, and quartering.</p>

<p>From an interview with Parker Love: 
I discovered that I owned another Troma movie: Joel Reed’s 1976 horror comedy, Blood Sucking Freaks – originally (and more accurately titled) The Incredible Torture Show. The blurb said it was about a Theatre of the Macarbe run by a sadist named Sardu. Punters come to watch his shows not realising that the naked women they see being mutilated and killed on stage are having that happen for real. Most of the film unfolds backstage in the lair that Sardu and his dwarf assistant, Ralphus, have decked out with kidnapped, hypnotised naked women who they mistreat and kill for their sexual pleasure. It’s basically torture porn conceived for shock value with a flimsy narrative shoehorned in.
On the DVD extras filmed years later, Lloyd Kaufman vaguely admits that he wouldn’t have released such a film today. Bowling is in accord: “I can’t really condone Blood Sucking Freaks and neither do Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz really. They think it’s a horrible movie but became involved in restoring the film, which is a necessary job. You wouldn’t call whoever restored The Jazz Singer racist. It’s just about preserving history whether it’s on the right or wrong side of it.”</p>
<p>Granted that Blood Sucking Freaks seems to be an outlier in that most of Troma’s output seems to be defined more by schlocky gore and cheap effects than hardcore female exploitation. Still, women running around naked is a staple. This does not faze or outrage Bowing in the slightest: “I have absolutely no problem with nudity in film. Watching movies like these as a very young woman really helped me growing up. Being able to see what all of these different women looked like caused me never to be insecure about my own image and gave me a confidence that was rare in girls my age. I’d recommend a Lloyd Kaufman film to any teenage girl.”
She points out that there is an equality of nudity running across Troma films! “Sure, Troma films have naked screaming young women but Troma is one of those rare companies to also feature naked screaming young men in their films as well!”

<p>Interview with Kansas Bowling, check out the story, it's weird.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HZ-jLoNimg</p>
<p>Looks like there is something strange going on, nothing conclusive, but also looking at some more of the artists she promotes they all share some weird stuff, Mikky Blanco's video has this satanic orgy theme:</p>

<p>Anyway. Don't have time for more but maybe some others can take a closer look at some of this.</p></p>
