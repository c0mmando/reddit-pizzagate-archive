        <strong>What Can We Do About This Twitter Link?</strong>
        <p><p>Hey guys, been following this subreddit for the last week since around 8k subs. This is a throwaway no shill bullshit, 2 minutes old.. Anyways, I checked out the .doc list of names and location of those twitter pedos and noticed one from my current town, gave them a search on facebook and found someone with the same name(only one showed up) in a location around 15 minutes away. He is married with 3 children, one of them a young boy, naturally I was abit worried(might be jumping to a conclusion here) </p>
<p>My questions is, is this enough evidence to go to the police to get them to investigate? How do you explain this situation to the police and give them enough reasonable doubt to investigate?</p></p>
