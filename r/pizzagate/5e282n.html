    Found an interesting article about Obama and a luncheon that turned up some concerning leads from 2013. Please help dig!
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I was researching a possible theory I had earlier, when I came across an
    <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2013/03/14/good-grief-obama-cant-eat-with-gop-because-no-food-taster-he-really-does-think-hes-a-king/">
     article on President Obama
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    There is a Read More link at the end of the passage, which leads to
    <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/03/14/obama-couldnt-eat-at-hill-meeting-without-taster-audio/">
     another website that contains audio
    </a>
    . The file has, unfortunately, been removed since 2013 when the article was posted.
   </p>
   <p>
    THIS IS NOT ALL
   </p>
   <p>
    I know that there is obvious imagery depicting Obama as the Pope, along with many symbols that relate to everything we now consider as part of pizzagate. From 2013.
   </p>
   <p>
    Moving on, to the real reason I was excited. One of the people to cater that lunch was a
    <a href="http://www.giffordsicecream.com/">
     Gifford's Ice Cream
    </a>
    . I had a feeling there was going to be a connection the moment I read it, and
    <a href="https://puu.sh/spg2d/4bc5982714.png">
     sure enough, I found something
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    I Scream for Cake Roll. Both the name and the imagery of the cake roll can't be a coincidence.
   </p>
   <p>
    I do not have the prowess to look through any podesta leak emails, but
    <a href="https://puu.sh/spgoT/685c70e5d0.png">
     they have a donations section
    </a>
    . Apparently, you can fill out a form that can be submitted and takes up to 6 weeks to hear back via email. This should be looked into further on if anyone that has been suspected received and email or emails from this organization. This could be something.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another company sponsoring the event is
    <a href="http://www.foxfamilychips.com/">
     Fox Family Potato Chips
    </a>
    . At the very bottom of the page, there is a
    <a href="https://puu.sh/sphm9/1d83786f07.png">
     Very odd logo
    </a>
    , with quotations around the word "Potato". This company is all about being as close to a natural potato as possible, so why the quotations? Please, look into these organizations. Get digging!
   </p>
   <p>
    I have taken screenshots in case anything gets changed or taken down if it hasn't already. I have a way to identify myself if anything happens and I have poked too far into the wrong place.
   </p>
   <p>
    Stay safe everyone.

    The cake roll thing just looks like a cake roll. The Fox Family Potato Chips logo seems a bit odd, though.
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit: To whoever downvoted this, make a cake roll. I wish you luck in making one without that "logo" showing up.

    it's possible your can connect potatoe to Mr potatoe. search for the images of mr potatoe head and government figures. potatoe could mean pedo, but it's only word association and it's hard not to have confirmation bias at this point.

    This is quite disturbing. There is so much out here, all in plain sight. This is absolutely mind boggling. What a twisted society we live in
