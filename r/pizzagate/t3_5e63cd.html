        <strong>Pedo-dictionary source</strong>
        <p><p>Hey guys!
I've been familiarizing more and more people with the pizzagate and one doubt keeps coming up and I cannot really provide much proof to it. People tend to ask about the source of pedophile dictionary. The only evidence which i could find was a 4chan post plus some old recollections of banning people on 4chan for using "cheese pizza" reference. However, for many it's not enough.</p>
<p>Do you guys happen any proof of such vocabulary being used in this context? In most of Polish articles it seems to be a big doubt factor, so it would be great if you had any more proof on that, so i could pass it on.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p></p>

        <p><p>Somebody posted a screenshot from a darknet site I assume where a bunch of people were commenting asking for cheese pizza 8-12 slices or another person asking for a cheese pizza 6-10 slices. It was obviously code for ages they were interested in and very sickening</p></p>

        <p><p>The pizza part of it comes from people asking for cp on 4chan. Other anons would reply "cheese pizza?" And then it graually got to the point where one would say "cheese pizza" when asking where to find it. Also, if you'll look through the top of the subreddit, we're finding a ton of things that point toward pizza being used as a code including podesta asking for a "pizza related handkerchief"</p></p>

        <p><p>I personally understand that this cannot be a coincidence and such high level personas cannot be talking so often about such low-class food like pizza, so it's rather a matter of others being reluctant to acknowledge that slang just basing on one anonymous post. </p></p>

        <p><p>Completely agree. They'd be talking about fucking sushi and expensive ribs and pastas if they were talking about food. That email about the pizza related handkerchief is, I believe, a chief piece of evidence of some sort of shady activity.</p></p>

        <p><p>Do you have any links to that? 
In all of those articles I keep seeing a phrase:
"It is all based on an anonymous post published by 4chan user, who claimed FBI has published a document in which such phrases were mentioned. No other proof whatsoever"</p></p>

        <p><p>Don't quote me on this.. But I think you may be conflicting two separate pieces.</p>
<p>The "FBI document" didn't have anything to do with pizza, as far as I know.. Instead, it was what put everyone on to the logos.</p>
<p>Link: https://wikileaks.org/wiki/File:FBI-pedophile-symbols-page1.jpg </p>
<p>(Link is 100% SFW, I promise)</p>
<p>The pizza talk is actually verifiable as well.. Just not "officially" documented. I've heard numerous reports that those keywords were well known on the deepweb and on halfchan long before this pizzagate thing started.</p></p>

        <p><p>No proof. The only "real" reference I could find was in a book that talked about 4chan slang... found on Google Books: https://books.google.com/books?id=ncGVPtoZPHcC&amp;pg=PT31&amp;dq=%22cheese+pizza%22+4chan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx2cer0rrQAhUEhlQKHVrNDfEQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cheese%20pizza%22%204chan&amp;f=false</p></p>

        <p><p>Pizza pie: British street slang (that the Beatles often used) referred to a "pie" or a "finger pie" in reference to women. If you also recall, one of the first Beatles' albums was banned because it had dolls and blood all around the guys.

Also: "getting a piece" is common slang for sex
Also: what sex thing is shaped like a piece of pizza? a man's "head" ?? perhaps??
Many words can be twisted to imply something sexual, but it depends on who is talking to who, and the emphasis of a word, whether it is out of place, or said with a wink.</p>
<p>Some of wikleaks twitter postings had misspelled words, and it could be that some clues can be found in these emails by misspelling a search term</p></p>

        <p><p>We can't have more "official" source I think. If they use those word codes it's because they think nobody know it, or just some ppl on darkweb.</p>
<p>But just for what I see in picture of jimmycomet and others, I'm sure "pizza" is a weird word code. Don't know for the rest.</p></p>

        <p><p>That's exactly why I'm asking such question. I can fully understand the 'pizza' reference, but how did the anon come up with others? Like 'sauce', 'nuts' etc.? </p></p>

        <p><p>I found an article a few years ago that talked about pedos using food as code for children, in that case they used "asparagus" as code for young boys. Will post source when I get home.</p></p>

        <p><p>The men use code words. Young boys, for instance, are referred to as "asparagus." New contacts typically invite each other to a private chat on mainstream sites like Yahoo or Hotmail.</p>
