<p>"(She) decided to take on one of the demagogues in the field of human trafficking."</p>
<p>"Produced a 110-page analysis of human trafficking in Haiti - 2 years of research."</p>
<p>"We were looking for someone who was smart enough and maybe brave enough to publish her work"</p>
<p>"I will continue to seek out and publish it for her"</p>
<p>"We are in a state of shock. We may never know what exactly happened to her"</p>
<p>He also briefly mentioned she planned on starting an NGO in Haiti to connect with others in the area to accomplish good</p></p>

<p><p>seems like he might have an old fashioned mindset about publishing stuff like that and thinks he has to go through a traditional publisher. might be an okay idea to contact him and advise him there could be powerful people looking to destroy her work and how it can be spread very quickly if posted in an online journal or getting it online in any way. </p></p>

<p><p>her consent? what happens to the rights of someones work after they die? if he was actively looking for a publisher before she died he probably has the ability to share it how he pleases, seems like it would have been what she wanted.</p></p>

<p><p>Probably not. He has ties to the Clintons. I researched yesterday. There is an active effort to scrub any web information on google. Article tags had information, but when clicking on link text missing. Now many articles there yesterday are gone. </p></p>

<p><p>UPDATE*** http://imgur.com/n6PJ7Zp Girl lover symbolism found in Bella's profile http://imgur.com/ji0o6eE
Have y'all taken the time to look at Bella Robinson's profile? She is a proud "sex worker", pro "sex-trade" Seems a bit odd to promote this so heavily after her "friend" was supposedly found dead under circumstances (in Bella's words) that point to a conspiracy? here's my convo with her:

<p><p>I very strongly hope I am wrong but I guess he is not going to publish these. If he wanted to, why he hasn't already? That "old-fashioned guy" argument is too naive. The guy is too afraid to publish is the best case scenario. </p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>The report has nothing important and She got killed just when she was about to find the lead.</p></p>

<p><p>not really that naive its understandable to not quite grasp the power of the internet. might think it could get pushed aside easier or something. there are a lot of reasons he might think has has to find a 'smart and brave' enough publisher</p></p>

<p><p>I wonder if perhaps we could (delicately) anon reach out to someone in this circle? If only to let them know of our interest...?</p></p>
