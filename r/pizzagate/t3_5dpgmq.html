<p>check the weird links on the right, they all lead to similar sites with the domain appliedchaosdynamicscontrolassociation.net , which also hosts http://lhohq.appliedchaosdynamicscontrolassociation.net (which is a blogger blog from 2008 when he likely didn't yet have a server).</p>
<p>found by googling the first block of "encrypted text" on http://lhohq.info/video_cassette_recorder/green_potatoe.html , which leads to http://lhohq.appliedchaosdynamicscontrolassociation.net/2008_01_01_archive.html, apparently made in January 2008.</p></p>

<p><p>I've been personally fascinated by this particular section of what's been uncovered. I've done a bunch of investigating the sites, backed them up and have been trawling through the crap. My current theory is the person who runs them is a "Bentley Ptythylhlyl", who I believe to really be Ken Rockwell, a real-life photographer and weirdo. </p>
<p>My theory is based on his LinkedIn which uses Ken Rockwell's photos: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentleyptythylhlyl</p>
<p>The sites are at least owned and operated by the same person (group?). I suspect a group would almost be necessary to create these websites given their intricacy and sheer size. They may "seem" random, but every piece of nightmare fuel had to be deliberately positioned and patterned, plus there are countless short films and photo albums which show several individuals. I can't say I've actually found anything legitimately incriminating on these sites so far, but I've learned this much:</p>
<p>"Bentley" is an incredibly busy psychopath who has access to important emails and personal info. Legitimate government documents, addresses, and names are listed throughout the sites that I don't think any normal citizen would have such immense access to.</p></p>

<p><p>A brave anon also found this site, a currently active blog written by a self-proclaimed Reptilian which has an entire sidebar for these sites: https://militantconsumerism.wordpress.com/</p>
<p>The author of this website, according to the first post, is a Menachem Bailey. The same name as a Jewish infant who died in 1993 in Florida. The rhetoric of ALL of these sites is highly anti-Semitic, which I find too strange. Plus everything from the LinkedIn to the blog indicates a belief that they are actually a Reptilian representing the "New World Order".</p>
<p>The red flags just keep falling from the sky. </p></p>

<p><p>Probably nothing, the LHOHQ site was just thrown around all the time, possibly to distract us.</p></p>

<p><p>This appeared when someone linked tamera luzatto's email address to that lhohq site. 4th page on searching her email address apparently. My contention is that her email is simply listed on that warren of a website. Dead-End False Lead</p></p>

<p><p>Still need time to compile a finished report, but I've been finding more:</p>
<p>LHOHQ was aware of and monitoring anon attempts to "crack" their code. Interestingly enough, they (or someone using their logo) was also distributing these logos on paper in the Milwaukee, WI area.</p>
<p>When anons got closer to social media accounts, a person going by "Bentley" told them "not to pay attention to the man behind the curtain". </p>
<p>This is the forum thread from June 2007 where rando blizzhackers got close enough for LHOHQ to make a page about it: http://archive.is/CAKn2</p></p>
