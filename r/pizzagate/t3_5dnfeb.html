<p><p>Very clever hashtag. Only problem with this flyer is that other than their images, there is no evidence that she was taken by them. We need to include the proof that they were in Portugal on the day of her disappearance and that following that date, months worth of emails from Podesta are missing in wikileaks.</p></p>

<p><p>Can someone link here to the story of this guy who owns a house in Portugal close to where Maddie was abducted, who had invited Maddie's parents at his place during the investigation, who was later discovered to be a pedophile, and who's connected to the Podestas? That's an even more serious indication than the pictures. Can't find the link, am on mobile.</p>
<p>Edit: the poster is GREAT, thank you OP</p>
<p>Edit: his name is Clement Freud! look it up. h/t mangazos</p></p>

<p><p>I think I may have been mistaken. I remember reading early on in this sub that the Podesta Bros had flown into Portugal the day before her disappearance. I don't have any of my sources anymore because I saved them as bookmarks on Tor and then the installation stopped launching and I had to re-install and lost all my bookmarks. Anyway, I don't have the source anymore, and I don't know if there is actual proof, especially considering that this flyer implies that we <em>think</em> they visit Portugal.</p>
<p>As a side note, if anyone has the <em>evidence</em> that the Podestas are/had visited Portugal, that'd be great.</p></p>

<p><p>I was wondering what Madelaine´s parents have to say about it, they should be the most concern, shouldn´t they? </p>
<p>Well it turns out that they were very good friends with Clement Freud, a convicted pedophile who owned a holiday house at Praia da Luz!!
He even met Gerry and Kate after their daughter disappeared. Kate wrote all about it in her book. 
When things couldn´t get worse

<p><p>From the Wikipedia page on the case:  <br/>
"Tanner sighting
drawing
Artist's impression of the man Jane Tanner saw, released October 2007; Scotland Yard believe it was this British tourist carrying his daughter.</p>
<p>The sighting by Jane Tanner, one of the Tapas Seven, of a man carrying a child that night became an important part of the early investigation. She had left the restaurant just after 21:00 to check on her own daughter, passing Madeleine's father on Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins on his way back to the restaurant from his 21:05 check. He had stopped to chat to a British holidaymaker,[43] but neither man recalled having seen Tanner. This became an issue that puzzled the Portuguese police, given how narrow the street was, and led them to accuse Tanner of having invented the sighting.[44]</p>
<p>At c. 21:10 Tanner noticed a man with a child cross the junction of Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins and Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva just ahead of her, heading east, away from the Ocean Club.[45][27][46] He was carrying a barefoot child wearing light-coloured pink pyjamas with a floral pattern and cuffs on the legs. She described the man as white, dark-haired, 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall, of southern European or Mediterranean appearance, 35–40 years old, wearing gold or beige trousers and a dark jacket, and said he did not look like a tourist. Tanner told the Portuguese police, but they did not pass the description to the media until 25 May.[47] Madeleine's Fund hired a forensic artist to create an image of the man (right), which was released in October 2007.[48][49]</p>
<p>Although Tanner had not seen the man's face, the sighting became important because it offered investigators a time frame for the abduction, but Scotland Yard came to view it as a red herring.[50] In October 2013 they said that a British holidaymaker had been identified as the man Tanner had seen, and that he had been returning to his apartment after collecting his daughter from the Ocean Club night creche.[51][52] Scotland Yard took photographs of the man wearing the same or similar clothes to the ones he was wearing on the night, and standing in a pose similar to the one Tanner reported. The pyjamas his daughter had been wearing also matched Tanner's report. Scotland Yard said they were "almost certain" the Tanner sighting was not related to the abduction.[53]
Smith sighting
Further information: § Oakley International
photograph
E-fit images of the Smith sighting, released by Scotland Yard in 2013[8]</p>
<p>Another sighting of a man carrying a child that night was reported by Martin and Mary Smith, on holiday from Ireland.[50] Scotland Yard concluded in 2013 that the Smith sighting offered the approximate time of Madeleine's kidnap.[50]</p>
<p>The Smiths saw the man at around 22:00 on Rua da Escola Primária, 500 yards (457 m) from the McCanns' apartment, walking toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. He was carrying a girl aged 3–4 years. She had blonde hair and pale skin, was wearing light-coloured pyjamas and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5 ft 7 in – 5 ft 9 in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He did not look like a tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child.[54][55][56]"  <br/>

<p><p>What I thought was pretty damning is that Podesta emails go back to a specific day. The day after Madeline was kidnapped. He must have known that they had a police composition done regarding their looks. These guys don't need to steal the children that they eat/rape/murder. They do it because they actually get a thrill out of doing it themselves. 42. The magic of deceit. </p></p>

<p><p>PLEASE STOP.  THIS PARTICULAR LEAD IS COMPLETE BULLSHIT.</p>
<p>Both of those sketches are different artist's interpretations of the same eyewitness who only claimed to have seen <em>one man</em>.  In other words, it is literally impossible that these two drawings represent the Podesta brothers unless the witness lied out of their ass.</p>
<p>EDIT for clarification and accuracy:  The two images aren't really "sketches", they're composite images generated by a computer program called E-Fit.  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/14/british-detectives-efits-madeleine-mccann-suspect">Here is a news story from the day these images were released.</a></p></p>

<p><p>The only problem I have... and btw I do believe there is something to his pizzagate</p>
<p>Convince me that two high profile politicians would be the one to commit the abduction?</p>
<p>Wouldn't they have one of their minions do it?</p>

<p><p>Agree with mystic314 but will elaborate. </p>
<p>I've seen the Podesta's being discounted as the perpetrators by arguing they would not have personally committed the abduction. Of course they would have personally committed the abduction as the act would be as or perhaps even more rewarding than possession (assuming the allegations are true). One has to only look at the history of and the types of personalities of documented serial abusers, rapists, killers. Can one imagine Bundy, Gacy or Ridgeway ordering a minion to kidnap the children and adults they raped and murdered for example? I can't. </p>
<p>I can think of one other reason, her distinctive eye (of Horus) would have been extremely important if the occult was a big reason for the abduction as has been alleged. It leads me to posit that it was not a random opportunistic crime but planned, possibly over years, until the right time and place came along. If she was important as a specific individual to the abductors, as I believe she was regardless of who committed the act, it would make no sense to leave it up to an underling.  </p></p>

<p><p>BILL CLINTON MET WITH SHEIKH MOHAMMED FROM SAUDI ARABIA IN LONDON IN MAY OF 2007.  This would have allowed the Podesta's to enter Europe under diplomatic cover, and thus, undetected.  From London, they could have made a quick jaunt to Portugal.  Madeleine McCann disappeared on May 3rd 2007.  </p>
<p>Here is the wikileaks that proves Bill Clinton's visit: 
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/38048#attachments</p>
<p>Here is the attachment, with official letterhead stating that:      "YOU met the Sheik in London in May, 2007, at which time the Agreement was signed and the first $2 million check was received"
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/38048#attachments</p>
<p>Now, the question becomes, can anyone definitively point out when exactly in May of 2007 Bill Clinton was in London?  Let me know what you can find!!  If it is on May 3rd or before, then we can likely posit that the Podesta's took a ride with him over there.</p>
<p>And.....GO!  </p></p>

<p><p>Thank you for that, I guess we can discount my theory then.  Let's keep looking for evidence of the Podesta's in Europe from May 1st to May 5th.  </p></p>

<p><p>Pardon my ignorance but I read a comment on this sub about Madeleine is not actually kidnapped but got ODed by her parents with sleeping pills by accident.</p>
<p>Like they gave her some sleeping pills to make her sleep and left home but they find her dead when they are back with some nose bleeding.</p>
<p>This happened at Portugal and UK police came over to help (or cover up) the case and nothing happened to her parents.</p>
<p>Am I just mixing up the stories?</p></p>

<p><p>I've heard that they used to sedate the children to ensure that they didn't wake up whilst thet went to drink with friends in the tapas bar. One of the early theories was that they had accidentally given Maddie too much and covered up her death to avoid prosecution. </p></p>

<p><p>You are right, the Portuguese police accused the parents of accidentally killing her after being unable to identify/name the perpetrators. The Mccanns vehemently denied, and the British police (if I'm correct) sided with the Mccanns. Personally given how much the Mccanns have sollicited public help I believe their daughter was kidnapped; if they wanted to hide something they would never IMO have acted in such a public fashion. Plus there's the actual testimony of these men (or a man) carrying (presumably) Maddie away.</p></p>

<p><p>It's just unfortunate that entire articles promoting the cause are being made off of the assumption that it's two different people.</p></p>

<p><p>It's unfortunate that people doubting the facts are doing so based on the outdated assumption that it is only one person. </p></p>

<p><p>EVIDENCE! How goddamn hard is it to provide evidence when you make a claim? See the thread I linked, I provided evidence of why I think it is based only one one suspect. Where is your evidence this isn't the case?  </p></p>

<p><p>Needs to be looked into more is all I'm saying. If they're looking for 1 person that is the abductor, it could be either. But saying it's both when it's not been confirmed is spreading false info. </p></p>

<p><p>The police were not certain when they said it is 'possibly' one person, and it's outdated information anyway. The latest info is that there are as many as six suspects. http://livingresistance.com/2016/11/18/podestas-involved-mccanns-abduction-factual-analysis/</p>
<p>The mole above Podesta's eyebrow is a dead give away. The odds of a match being that precise, by chance alone, are about the same as being struck by lightening three times in a row on a sunny day. </p></p>

<p>Yes, but there are different drawings for them. These two are from different witnesses who saw the same <em>man</em>, singular, walking holding a child. Neither of them saw two men.</p>

<p><p>Two separate witnesses could have seen what was thought to be the same man based on the circumstances but, who, in fact, were actually different men. </p></p>

<p><p>And again at that time the police said it was 'possible' it was the same suspect. Investigations proceed inductively, nowhere will you find anybody saying "we are absolutely certain this is the one suspect, so if evidence is produced that says otherwise it must be wrong" or anything like that. </p>
<p>We now have strong inductive evidence suggesting the Podesta brothers were involved -- the precise match down to the mole above Tony's eyebrow sufficiently outweighs the possibility that it was one person, so that the original narrative will have to be squared with the new evidence.</p>
<p>This is WHY police use terms like 'possibly' or 'probably' -- because new evidence can be furnished later which outweighs the original supposition. </p>
<p>They never said anything like "this is certainly the same person, therefore any new evidence suggesting otherwise will have to be dismissed" because that is just not how investigations proceed. That is dogma, not inquiry. </p>
<p>This is a case in point.  </p></p>

<p><p>The police said they believed the efits are of the same man. There's no evidence that they now believe the efits to be of more than one person.  </p>
