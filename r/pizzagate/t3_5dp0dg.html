        <strong>Is Scientology an undercover anti-MKULTRA organization looking to stop child trafficking?</strong>
        <p><p>They would need to masquerade as a religion because it would give a lot more freedoms than if they were some other kind of organization... I'm just brainstorming here, but it seemed weird that with all the government and religious ties associated with pizzagate and the rest of wikileaks, Scientology has been totally absent. </p>
<p>They were formed in the 50s, supposedly right around when The Finders were almost outed in D.C. and had to relocate around America. Their founder met a demise much like other people that pissed off the government... paranoid that his org had been infiltrated, trusting only a few, going into hiding, then death. </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Snow_White
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Guardian%27s_Office_operations</p>
<p>In the 60s &amp; 70s Scientologists infiltrated a lot of government branches in and attempted to gather/plant evidence... the official narrative says that it was to delete bad files about themselves or to cover up tax indiscretions. One could theorize they were instead gathering evidence of the child trafficking and other corruption in an attempt to be a sort of anti-illuminati.  </p>
<p>To this day they have a stance focusing on human rights... and Dianetics is a sort of pseudo-psychology dedicated to helping people resolve mental issues related to abuses of the past.  </p>
<p>Very interesting article they recently posted... <a href="http://www.freedommag.org/issue/201610-the-shocking-truth/investigation/chemical-restraint.html">Chemical Restraint -  Foster children still being drugged into submission</a> </p>
<p>http://www.youthforhumanrights.org/news/youth-summits/13th-annual-yhri-summit-2016-summary.html</p>
<p>One from 2014... focusing on underaged children being trafficked into America for the sex industry. <a href="http://www.freedommag.org/issue/201408-military/out-of-the-shadows.html">Out of the Shadows
21st-century Slavery in America</a></p>
<p>Another similar article... about the sex trade in America<a href="http://www.freedommag.org/issue/201409-under-influence/world/the-price-of-human-life.html">The Price of Human Life</a></p>
<p>They have many other articles just like that... in addition to accusations of the <a href="http://www.freedommag.org/issue/201604-pill-pushers/the-lead/exposing-the-cias-involvement-in-the-cocaine-trade.html">CIA running the cocaine trade</a> and being very critical of the <a href="http://www.freedommag.org/issue/201606-military-spending/society/going-after-whistleblowers.html">government's whistleblower</a> stances... They even <a href="http://www.freedommag.org/issue/201409-under-influence/media-and-ethics/the-corruption-of-information.html">call out the MSM</a> for decieving the public. </p>
<p>When you realize that governments have the ability to write the narrative for us... consider that maybe that is why Scientology is painted as a weird UFO cult. Because the government wants to discredit them and their research... just like any person that threatens to expose the truth... they are silenced, persecuted, and discredited.  </p>
<p>This would help explain why a "religion" is so well funded and secretive... they have high-security offices that look like an FBI building... it would also help explain why Hollywood treats the stars that follow Scientology like outcasts when just about every other religion in the world is fine for them to follow. </p>
<p>I've only spent a couple hours ruminating over this... but if you believe in pizzagate... believe that a secret pro-pedo society exists...  then maybe you could belive that there is a counter-movement operating against the kiddy diddlers. </p></p>

        <p><p>I would doubt it. I read a book by a woman raised in Scientology and it was all kinds of messed up emotional abuse toward their own kids. Sorry, can remember he name of the book right now.</p></p>

        <p><p>No periods. They just us IAS as the acronym. (Assuming you are talking about the International Association of Scientologists). Though a better choice for your point would be OSA (Office of Special Affairs)... which is Scientology's intelligence branch.</p></p>

        <p><p>Xenu is actually akin to the "Satan" figure of scientology. At least in the sense that he is responsible for mankind's current (negative) state. Then again, they aren't actually told about that part of their teachings until they've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars and thousands of hours on Scientology. Similar to Mormon's "milk before meat" mantra.</p></p>

        <p><p>Scientology is definitely not opposed to being involved in the pedo business with all the other flavours of occultism. They are well known for their shady dealings in dark rituals as much as the rest. One rather famous one was the summoning of the whore of Babylon.</p></p>

        <p><p>I looked up that reference to see what it meant... and I see that he supposedly had close ties with Aleister Crowley for a while... then when he realized it was bad for his image he said he was actually "working on an undercover mission for U.S. Naval Intelligence to investigate black magic." </p>
<p>Tinfoil hat for a minute... and imagine it was true... and he was one of the first satanist honeypots. </p></p>

        <p><p>Scientology is an offshoot of Aleister Crowley's Thelema cult. L. Ron Hubbard famously stated, years before starting Scientology, "Writing for a penny a word is ridiculous. If a man really wants to make a million dollars, the best way would be to start his own religion."</p>
<p>Hubbard then got involved with Crowley's followers, notably JPL founder Jack Parsons. After Hubbard stole Parsons' girlfriend and over $7,000 out of his $20,000 life savings, he skipped out and founded his little cult, which is nothing more than an organized crime racket with tax-exempt status.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah... been meaning to watch that one. His films though, scream out at me 'liberal propaganda.' The Scientology movie (a favorite target), the hit-piece on Steve Jobs (another one), then this movie where he has 'unprecedented' access to the US Intelligence community... feels like the resume of a top-level spook to me.</p></p>
