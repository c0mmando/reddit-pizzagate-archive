<strong>Compiling a list of pedo ring coverups and implicated individuals.</strong>
<p><p>So there have been <em>quite a few</em> investigations into pedophile rings that implicated important people from various governments over the last few decades.  Many key witnesses died or have been threatened into silence. Prosecution has been lacking, with the famous clients going free, even if the ringleader was taken down. <br/>
Evidence has disappeared, or even been classified to protect those at the top. </p>
<p>I would like some help compiling a detailed list. Each entry should be a top level comment with the name of the scandal or location. Relevant news articles and documentaries should be linked. The names of witnesses and their allegations should be summarized, so that the alleged high profile abusers and the institutions that protected them can be seen, so that we can see how they might all be linked.</p></p>

<p><p>John Wayne Gacy here in Chicago. Part of a national child trafficking ring.  Index of 30k clients, including prominent politicians went missing during investigation.  WGN here in Chicago aired an piece over the summer detailing how there is much more we don't know.  No doubt in my mind Chicago is a hub for this trafficking.  Denny Hasert is most likely implicated as well -edit with link, please watch this-https://youtu.be/t1VpZHO5WC8</p></p>

<p><p>Also regarding Gacy, a few years ago, they announced that they were about to arrest Gacy's accomplice(s), yet not a word has been spoken of since. The reason they believe he had one or more accomplices is because it is confirmed that Gacy was out of town when one of the victims found buried in his basement went missing, so somebody had to have had a key to his home. </p></p>

<p><p>Chicago definitely can be a MAIN hub for this trafficking.</p>
<p>I work for a fortune 500 logistics company.  Chicago is the number one market for inbound and outbound shipments across this country.</p>
<p>Especially trains and refrigerated trucks.  It would be all to easy to move people this way across the country because no one is going to question 1 of the hundreds containers that are on each train.</p>
<p>We should maybe look into the rail commissions for each state and see if we can connect any dots.  </p></p>

<p><p><strong>I will separate verifiable parts from my personal conjecture part</strong></p>
<p><strong>Verifiable Part</strong></p>
<p>There was a <strong>shipping container</strong> involved in the November discovery of a kidnapped women, Kala Brown, in South Carolina. She said she had been held captive 2 months by <em>realtor</em> Todd Kohlhepp in a shipping container on his 90 acre farm. Kohlhepp killed her boyfriend and took her captive when the pair arrived at Kohlhepp's farm to work a job for him.
http://ktla.com/2016/11/05/body-found-on-south-carolina-property-is-kidnapped-womans-boyfriend-suspect-confesses-to-2003-killings/</p>
<p>She wasn't trafficked in the container, but he had to get the shipping container from somewhere also its not something you bring to your new farm home in a U-Haul... You have to order the container and have it delivered on a flatbed truck.</p>
<p>Brings a rational person to want to ask: WHERE did he get container? HOW did he deliver it to his home? &amp; WHY didn't it seem odd to any neighbors or odd to whomever sold it to him, that a realtor on a farm wants a shipping container?</p>
<p>Sure at first this looked like another story of an odd, but typical lone serial killer.. and when I first heard the story thats what I thought. But you mentioning shipping containers had me want to go back and look at the case again. As I have been lurking and learning of far too many pedophile, kidnapping, and trafficking rings to not go back and give Kohlhepp's case a 2nd look</p>
<p>Which lead me to this disturbing November 7th WaPo news story: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2016/11/07/accused-killer-may-have-reviewed-shovel-on-amazon-keep-in-car-when-you-have-to-hide-the-bodies/</p>
<p>Note the 7th or 8th paragraph mentions the Amazon product reviews have since been <strong>removed</strong>. If Kohlhepp's in custody, then either someone he knows who has access to his account tried to cover or Amazon took them down. Odd thing for Amazon to do on its own, especially since WaPo are the 1st to report his deleted reviews. The author of the WaPo article even goes on to point out Amazon's CEO owns Washington Post. If the Amazon company did delete reviews themselves it would be odd for your CEO's personally owned news publication to draw attention to it. Especially in the way they did, which sort of only serves fuelled speculation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2016/11/07/accused-killer-may-have-reviewed-shovel-on-amazon-keep-in-car-when-you-have-to-hide-the-bodies/">Sherriff Wright told reporters</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>the investigation was not being limited to South Carolina but did not want to reveal further details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/crime/2016/11/09/spartanburg-coroner-release-identities-2-bodies-found-kohlhepp-land/93546930/">Megean Coxie and John Coxie were also found buried nearby.</a> Almost <em>exactly</em> one year before the disappearance of Kala Brown</p>
<p>The deleted Amazon reviews attributed to Kohlhepp, notably the padlock review, are from 2014. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>solid locks..have 5 on a shipping container.. won't stop them..but sure will slow them down til they are too old to care </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on this review we can assume he already had his shipping container and first captives. September 2014 puts that almost literally a year before Coxie's disappearance and almost exactly 2 years before Brown's disappearance. So who was the shipping container victim of his 2014 padlock review? </p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3917650/Pictured-shipping-container-serial-killer-Tood-Kohelepp-turned-hell-earth-chained-kidnap-victim-forced-watch-murdered-boyfriend.html">Worth noting Brown, the woman rescued, is receiving quite the security in protective custody. Three car loads.</a> Around 9th-10th paragraph: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brown is under police protection with three car loads of officers outside the secret address where she is also being helped by counselors and her mother.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3917650/Pictured-shipping-container-serial-killer-Tood-Kohelepp-turned-hell-earth-chained-kidnap-victim-forced-watch-murdered-boyfriend.html">Also worth pointing out</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Detectives are working on the theory that their suspect gave a number of cryptic clues on the web about his murder and kidnap campaign over the last 13 years." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>hmm theory sounds relatable..</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture/Speculation</strong></p>
<p>Kohlhepp is currently 45, and he was 43 at the time of the Amazon padlock review. His known victims the Coxie's and Brown's were both late 20s early 30s. To wait for 30 year old captives to to be "too old to care" would put you, a 45 year old even older. It doesn't make sense.. Also that doesn't match up with the 1-year pattern of Coxie's and Brown's who were almost certainly not his first container captives. So who was his 2014 Amazon review victim(s), and why would you want them to eventually be "too old to care", as if he was planning on keeping them for long term captivity or transport and wanting them Stockholmed (Stockholm Syndrome)</p>

<p><p><em>Possibly</em>, based on allegations by former (alleged) victim of Ed Savitz (big donor to loyal Hillary surrogate and former PA Governor Ed Rendell) Greg Bucceroni, the Jerry Sandusky/The Second Mile pedophilia scandal was actually part of a much larger child trafficking ring. This ties in cases including the Kathleen Kane prosecution (PA's attorney general) and, believe it or not, a declined opportunity in PA to charge Bill Cosby many years ago.</p>
<p>I've written more about this in some of my comments (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5b5oc0/oh_god_there_is_a_mass_pedo_ring/d9m64i1/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5b5oc0/oh_god_there_is_a_mass_pedo_ring/d9m7l0s/">here</a>). I think there are a LOT of possible leads and Clinton connections here, plus Harrisburg is dominated by a notoriously corrupt old boys' club.</p>

<p><p>This is one I feel is important. Remember Rendell picked up 56 kids from haiti and brought them to some adoption agency and he wasn't assigned to do this. Someone else was working on this and he decided to take over.  This is in the wikileaks. I have to research it more. OMG savitz and sanduscky those sick fucks are connected to him as well.  </p>
<p>WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS ONE!</p></p>

<p><p>Oh wow, in all of my Rendell-related digging I hadn't even stumbled onto this aspect of it. </p>
<p>http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705359693/53-orphans-from-Haiti-arrive-in-Pennsylvania.html</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They range in age from a few months to 12 years old, with about half between 7 and 12, according to Clare Kushma, a spokesman for Catholic Charities of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The rescue mission came in response to messages last week from sisters Jamie and Ali McMutrie of Ben Avon, who said this month's devastating earthquake endangered the health of 130 children in their care at the BRESMA orphanage in Port-au-Prince.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell accompanied a medical team from several Western Pennsylvania medical facilities on the plane to pick up the children. [. . .] <strong>Rendell said that after hurdling numerous legal obstacles to get a rescue plane to Haiti, the mission nearly collapsed when Haitian and U.S. authorities were reluctant to allow all 53 of the children to leave the island.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and to close the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who went on the mission have not disclosed who funded it. Republic Airways, based in Indianapolis, provided the aircraft used in the rescue mission to Haiti.</p>

<p><p>And an update from a year later, in January 2011, discussing how many of these airlifted "orphans" were still awaiting adoption a year later: http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/01/11/haiti.us.orphans/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The children's complex legal status unfolded because they were airlifted out of Haiti in the midst of a crisis, <strong>believed to be orphans in the process of being adopted by U.S. parents.</strong> The plan was to finish the adoptions in the United States, an unusual exception to international adoption protocol.
 </p>
<p>But once the children were in the United States, <strong>it quickly became clear not all of them were orphans already matched with U.S. families.</strong> Even for those who were, completing adoptions from so far away had obstacles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A string of government agencies was able to get most of them placed with adoptive parents or in foster homes in days. But several remained detained in shelters over the course of the year for a variety of reasons:
<em>Some children did not have firm commitments from U.S. adoptive parents.
</em>In about a dozen cases, the U.S. adoptive parents changed their minds and returned the children to shelters.
<em>In other cases, the <strong>biological parents in Haiti had not finished paperwork declaring they were giving up their children for adoption, or the paperwork was missing.</strong>
</em>The Haitian government slowed the adoption process further <strong>after one group of Americans was arrested for trying to illegally depart the country with children.</strong> (*note: does the timing make sense for this to be referring to Laura Silsby?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[. . .]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2009, the year before the quake, the U.S. State Department processed 330 adoptions from Haiti. The earthquake prompted the government to open the door to hundreds more, in some cases reducing to weeks what can be a four-year process.
 </p>
<p>In a report being released on the quake anniversary, the Florida Immigration Advocacy Center spotlights the difficulty in making sure adoptions are legitimate and in the children's best interests when they are rushed.
 </p>
<p>"Given the emergency nature of their evacuation from Haiti, some children were brought without proper entry documents or evidence of the ongoing adoption process begun in Haiti," the report said. "A few adoptions have failed, and some children's permanent placements are still unclear."
 </p>
<p>The report also describes children who were taken out in medical evacuations, never intended for adoption, but nonetheless in the United States now with no parents to care for them.</p>

<p><p>Jesus is right, this may need its own post.  We need to start looking at who took these kids in as well. Tomorrow I will look into this. Thanks for the digging.</p></p>

<p><p>And a few more articles to follow up on:</p>
<p>*http://www.thompsoncoe.com/Attorneys/www.thompsoncoe.com/portalresource/tackett (starts out by talking about the Laura Silsby situation, pages 10-11 delve into Rendell's airlift of Haitian children and how it defies the Hague Convention)</p>
<p>*https://spectator.org/21671_altmire-manipulation-haiti-rescue/</p>
<p>To be fair, there are also positive articles following up on the stories of some of the adopted orphans (http://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2015/01/11/Five-years-on-three-Haiti-orphans-are-settled-in-their-Pittsburgh-lives/stories/201501080263) and the sisters who worked in Haiti and helped organize the airlift (http://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/Pittsburgh-Magazine/January-2015/Update-The-McMutrie-Sisters-Mission-5-Years-After-the-Haiti-Earthquake/)</p></p>
