        <strong>Automatic At Sea - "Eve finds herself trapped in an unstable reality punctuated by feverish visions, dimensional shifting and secret pizza."</strong>
        <p><p>Kickstarter for "Automatic by Sea"</p>
<p>https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/caesura/automatic-at-sea-a-feature-film-exploring-hidden-r
"Here's our synopsis (if you're into that sort of thing): On a whim, Eve (young Swedish traveler) accepts an invitation from Peter (wealthy heir) to vacation on his familyâ€™s private island off the coast of New England. As a series of unexpected delays prevent other guests from arriving, Eve discovers that she has little in common with the increasingly erratic Peter and that something is not quite right on this mysterious island. Gradually the idyllic natural beauty of her surroundings dissolves, and Eve finds herself trapped in an unstable reality punctuated by feverish visions, dimensional shifting and secret pizza."</p>

        <p><p>that symbology is an Ouroboros. 
self-devouring snake.</p>
<p>"taken to symbolize, introspection, the eternal return or cyclicality, especially in the sense of something constantly re-creating itself. It also represents the infinite cycle of nature's endless creation and destruction, life and death."</p>
<p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros</p>
<p>-Also links to Osiris.
("14+fish" pic of Podesta)
14, represents the parts collected by Isis (wife/sister of Osiris)(kinda strange the biggest enemy of the world is ISIS) the fish represents the only piece of Osiris that was never recovered, his penis, because the fish ate it. </p></p>

        <p><p>Is there any evidence that she has any connection with Besta/Comet Pizza? Because this plot sounds like the stories of the victims that have developed DID</p></p>
