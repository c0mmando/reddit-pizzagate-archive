<p><p>Interesting, I wonder if this guy has a Twitter, maybe we can message him about #pizzagate for him to get involved? Than again, this was posted by google, and some people say google is in on the whole media cencorship deal, so maybe they posted that just so we would wish to contact him so that he looks into it, finds nothing and discredits our whole research.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p></p>

<p><p>That is something that is difficult indeed as he says that they are doing a great job withing the US already, which has been absolutely disproved.</p>
<p>He is apparently behind the documentary;
The Abolitionists is a 2016 documentary film by Darrin Fletcher and Chet Thomas about a sting mission orchestrated in Colombia by the independent Operation Underground Railroad jump team, led by former U.S. Homeland Security Special Agent Timothy Ballard, countering child sex trafficking.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFJCC6wYkP0</p>
<p>His website is; https://ourrescue.org/</p>
<p>More info; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Underground_Railroad</p>
<p>He partnered with; http://www.delitor.com/
to work on a task group at the university of North Carolina named Child Exploitation Targeting Center of Excellence (CET-COE)</p>
<p>Can't find much on said task group itself, ~~although while performing some searches I found the article below which gives you the question, if persons on the campus would take it serious, would this happen? 
http://www.wbtv.com/story/30511367/unc-assistant-professor-charged-with-sexual-exploitation-of-a-minor~~</p>
<p>EDIT; https://ourrescue.org/blog/becoming-a-global-force-for-good-the-creation-of-cet-coe/ shows that task center has been setup June 8th 2016.</p></p>

<p><p>Interesting timing on this. Maybe a way of Google trying to make themselves look good considering the explosion of this, making us think they have nothing to do with Pizzagate stuff... who knows... or maybe there could actually be some clues in this. I will watch it later.</p></p>
