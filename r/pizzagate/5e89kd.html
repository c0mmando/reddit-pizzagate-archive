    (Video): Kim Noble (Comet Ping Pong Artist) allows her alternate personality, Ria Pratt, to open up about experiencing ritual abuse in eerie Oprah segment interview.
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    EDIT: A commenter has pointed out that Kim Noble does not have any personal connection to Comet Ping Pong. I would change the title, but I can't at this point.
   </p>
   <p>
    Video Here:
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Art-Therapy-and-Dissociative-Identity-Disorder-Video
   </p>
   <p>
    I saw Kim Noble mentioned in another post: (https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e1tu3/these_women_provided_drawings_showing_how_the/)
   </p>
   <p>
    This post showed similarities between several victims' stories. Further research shows that Kim Noble is an artist with disassociative identity disorder. Ria Pratt is just one of her many personalities each with their own artistic style, though several reference sexual abuse. See all of her personalities here:
   </p>
   <p>
    http://kimnoble.com/virtual_galleries.htm
   </p>
   <p>
    To me, the interview video is clear. Ria Pratt legitimately experienced or observed everything that she depicts in her paintings.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some interesting language to consider:
Ria says she was "zapped" by her captors. Zapping sticks seems to be a common theme in the stories of victims.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ria discusses "good sweets" and "bad sweets." Are these new code words?

    Again, Kim Noble did not do any of the art at Comet.

      Yes. Twitter has been spreading the nonsense that Kim Noble's art "decorates" the interior of Comet.
     </p>
     <p>
      Utter bullshit, and I wish people would check their facts before they retweet it as it just goes to discredit our work.

        The quick flip to ad hominem attack says to me that they have a different agenda. Fellow investigators/info disseminators would be more likely to be embarassed and double check their facts themselves. Or at least I'd hope we would.

      Yes.  The only "link" is that someone saw a concert poster and thought it reminded them of of her artwork.

      I believe the only link she has is that her art gave the most logical explanation for the pizza hanky email.

      The permanent artwork inside Comet Ping Pong was done by Arrington De Dionyso, not Kim Noble. Sasha Lord (Event promoter at Comet Ping Pong) has a group of 4 or 5 artists that produce posters for music act promotion, none of which are Kim Noble.
     </p>
     <p>
      Kim Noble gets referenced because she was a victim or prolonged abuse, and her work depicts the psychology effects of that experience.
There are thematic similarities between her artwork and that of some of the artwork used in event promotion posters, but that's all.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tony Podesta's art collection doesn't include Kim Noble either. But every piece he owns is fucking weird.

     Thanks for this input. I had not substantiated the claim with my own research. I still think the video is interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
     [EDIT]: I think the first time I saw her mentioned was just that one of the bands playing at Comet Ping Pong had used her art for a flier. I will look for original link. I think that could still be an interesting connection.

    This shit is getting really hard to keep researching. That was hard to watch. I really hope people get to the bottom of this and find proof to get every single one of these people what they have coming to them. I just can't follow it this close anymore.

    The artwork that's been showcased by WL Mag and Transformer DC in both of T. Podesta's houses and the horrifying Intagrams of CPP and others is disturbing enough. I am sick of seeing this faux story shared. Kim noble's "alters' paint while she is asleep. There is no commissioning of art going on. This story seems to be a stupid , worthless planted story to distract from items with actual sources.
