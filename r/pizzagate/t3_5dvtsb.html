        <p><p>http://pizzagate.herokuapp.com I think. There might also be a few other tools like that (WebBrain?)</p>
<p>Also, Photoshop, or GIMP if you're on Linux.</p></p>

        <p><p>Use any image-editing software. Freeware like GIMP is perfectly fine. The key to working effectively is the understand and use layers within your image so you can adjust your composition to better explain the content or draw relationships between multiples pieces.</p>
<p>http://www.photoshopessentials.com/basics/layers/layers-intro/</p>
<p>As you work, save your image as an uncompressed file format native to that software that preserves your layers. That way if you need to make changes, it's easier to do so.</p>
<p>For this summary image I had at minimum 5 layers.</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/Hf9ssa.jpg</p>
<p>The top layer for text overlay</p>
<p>The image layer for arranging all of the individual pieces.</p>
<p>A layer underneath the images to add lines and labels for the relationships that those lines represented.</p>
<p>An underlayer to add background paint under any text that didn't have enough contrast between it and the background/texture layer.</p>
<p>And the background layer for the underlying color/texture.</p></p>
