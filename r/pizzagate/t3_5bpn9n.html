        <p><p>I wonder how many of these pedos are former victims. It's like this horrible endless cycle. They probably feel justified in what they're doing, like it's the hazing ritual they had to go through. :(</p>
<p>I almost prefer the world I lived in a few days ago where corruption was just all about money.</p>
<p>But I'm glad we know.</p></p>

        <p><p>Found <a href="http://abovethelaw.com/2010/07/lawyerly-lairs-an-associate-and-an-art-collection/">this article</a> on cboutlier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even more impressive, however, is the couple’s art collection. It includes 100 pieces, and it’s so large that only a fifth of the collection is on display at any given time. Highlights include a black-and-white Joan Miro lithograph, purchased over a decade ago (for $12,000); original Monet pencil sketches, which Boutlier inherited from his French grandmother; a black-and-gold Baker chest, also inherited from Boutlier’s grand-mère; and a 2005 piece by Kara Walker, whose works grace museum walls. </p>

        <p><p>The kid in that photo looks a lot like Lisa Irwin a child listed on the FBI kidnapped page.</p>
<p>https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/kidnap/lisa-irwin</p>
<p>Also, I find it weird that the tag was #pasta - I don't see any pasta on her face. </p>
<p>The date on the photo and the date the kid went missing don't match up but it could be that they posted an older photo. </p></p>

        <p><p>The problem is that everything we have is circumstantial. :(</p>
<p>They know that as long as they keep using code and being just subtle enough, that they can't get charged.</p></p>

        <p><p>Nah, the FBI will catch them</p>
<p>For instance, if they subpoenaed all of their bank records they could see if the used any structured transactions to individuals that buy a strange amount of Pizza. Cross those transactions with convicted sex offenders and priests in the area. </p>
<p>They could also see if they made any withdrawals or deposits to any crypto-currency exchanges and they could  follow the fraud-proof trail left by those transactions. If they found any, I bet that would reveal a lot about their code language. </p></p>

        <p><p>They already have somebody in the DOJ who is supposed to be in charge of sex trafficking. If they have been doing this for decades, which they have, it would only be a matter of time until you can appoint the right people/person in the FBI to maintain leverage.</p>
<p>I am very skeptical of this getting sorted out internally, so to speak, due to the length of this and the blatantness of it all. I just feel like at the very least, DC police would know about this and realized they are just lower on the power chain.</p>
<p>So that's the question, where on the power chain is the FBI? Well, going from this week, we know they're below Hillary and friends.</p></p>
