<strong>To all the "Getting no attention" posts</strong>
<p><p>Guys, seriously. Sure this shit is getting no media attention, because there is barely a post that is not half of personal opinions, wrong conclusions and biased views on completely normal things. </p>
<p>Create reasonable posts, dont upvote wild theories without a single proof, stop harassing random people because they commented on a picture once. Get some actual facts. Or at least let the top posts be actual facts, that would already help a lot.</p>
<p>No serious media outlet will be willing to join this shitshow.</p></p>

<p><p>This is really well said.</p>
<p>A lot of us complain about misinformation in the news, right now if they run with this story it is just unclarified misinformation and a smear campaign based on some, admitidally compelling, pictures and emails. So we'd just be adding to the problem. </p></p>

<p><p>I just got here today and all I'm seeing is a lot of loose associations and coincidences. Simply by me saying that, it will be assumed that I'm somehow a mole or working for the FBI. There's some absolute nutters in this sub. </p></p>

<p><p>It's on us to get the proof.  You're entirely missing the point of this sub.  Stop trying to curate.  We all know pizza is pedophilia.  People aren't dumb and connections are being made.  Post leads, users look into them, if not verifiable we debunk them and cross it off the list.  What really needs to stop is this attempted curation of the sub.  It's unneeded.  If a lead is bunk, it's bunk.  Things with proof and obvious connections will make their way to the top just as they always have.</p></p>

<p><p>Some people in this sub started to see pedophilia everywhere where pizza is mentioned. Like every fucking pizza place. I am sure some of them are trolls, others are full into that paranoia.</p>
<p>And see my last point, many of the top stories right now are just wild speculation. If the top stories would be actual facts we plus the media could make way more out of it. </p>
<p>I am not saying to stop drawing lines generally. All i am saying is to do that in a bit more hidden way. Like not upvoting each fucking post with wild, completely biased and non fact based speculations.</p>
<p>Edit:// Do you really think speculation about satanism and how every fucking triangle is now a pedo symbol is helpful for all this?</p></p>

<p><p>It's not un-helpful.  We have no idea how deep this all goes.  I posted some links about John Wayne Gacy, not to distract, but it's something to keep in the back of the mind.  Who knows what trail someone is on, if a thought or idea comes up, why not at least keep it in the back of your mind.  The idea of trying to curate an investigation is crazy to me...it's like saying "look here, but not there cause that rock is too heavy and there is nothing under it anyway"...Answer me how does that mentality help?  We need to stop treating everyone as if they are dumb.  I'm a normie, I know pizza means little kids, and if I have a thought or suggestion I should feel obligated to post it...Maybe it's useful, maybe it's not, but that's the entire point.  Leave no stone unturned </p></p>

<p><p>Like this: https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5d1s0w/possible_bombshell_most_png_attachments_in/</p>
<p>It is simply a complete lack of understanding how images/UTF/encoding works and complete bullshit. Still it is currently the second top post.</p>
<p>Somebody posted this pizza place: http://bpffutureprospects.com/ only because of the spirales in the logo. </p>
<p>Things like this are simply not helpful. Sure maybe interesting clues, but why the hell do they have to be upvoted to the frontpage of this sub?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know pizza means little kids</p>

<p>This is exactly it. In 99% of all cases (most likely even more) it simply does not. It just means Pizza. Only in the right context it can be seen as codework, but posting every single website that contains the word pizza, only because of that, is just stupid.</p>
<p>Edit:// Or the completely unrelated email someone posted yesterday. No connection at all whatsoever. But it mentioned pizza, people went apeshit. The Email explicitely mentioned that they were going to get pizza for their company. I've writen emails like this more than once, because thats just something collegues do. Getting pizza, without raping childs on the way.</p>
<p>Edit2:// Or how everyone blames each other to be censoring and a pedo. Seriously, people PM me asking if i work for the CIA. No wonder privately owned websites have to be careful about which posts they allow, but no /u/spez is a pedo ...</p>
<p>Edit3:// The first post i mentioned here more than doubled in upvotes. Even thought the debunking comment is now #2. See how stupid this shit is?</p></p>

<p><p>No. Somebody did debunk it minutes after the guy posted it. Then more and more people arrived to upvote it and throw in their obviously non technical based opinion. That is the problem. The comment debunking it is not even at the top, people dont want to hear that shit and you get called out as shill as soon as you try.</p></p>

<p>So focus on the leads that exist and work from there instead of trying to implicate every pizza parlor in the country.</p>
