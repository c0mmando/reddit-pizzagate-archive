        <strong>I wonder if Cathy O'Brien is watching this sub?</strong>
        <p><p>First off, how incredibly brave was she to speak out when basically NOBODY was red-pilled yet?</p>
<p>I also wonder if she would be willing to help?  She might have some insight as far as codewords, connections and locations that were not alluded to in the emails.</p>
<p>Video for those that may not have seen this...</p>

        <p><p>if you are interested in MK research the court settlements in Canada. Provides a ton of legitimacy when people want to insist none of this could happen. The US has done a better job of keeping it under wraps than the UK. </p></p>

        <p><p>My autism went on full overload after you mentioned this.  I came across something interesting and I don't know if the gain on my firmly affixed tinfoil hat needs to be turned down?  </p>
<p>Ok, here goes....we have established that rabbits is a codeword, we know the highest levels in govt are involved,  we have unconfirmed references to MK breeder programs, and we know there are pedo rings in the UK, Canada and USA....so I searched rabbits as a keyword in the Wikileaks diplomatic cables and came across this one guy that only authored 3 cables and they deal with "Collecting Payments for Rabbits". </p>
<p>https://www.wikileaks.com/plusd/?qproject[]=ps&amp;qproject[]=cg&amp;qproject[]=cc&amp;qproject[]=fp&amp;q=&amp;qftags=MACDONALD%2C+JAMES+L#result</p>
<p>So an American diplomat of Eurasian affairs is talking about Canadian rabbits?  The text is not available, I guess it is on microfiche.  I realize this is not the rabbit hole we are looking for...just thought it was weird.</p></p>

        <p><p>your tinfoil might be a bit stronger than my tinfoil. I also raise rabbits.. so the idea that they could be talking about actual rabbits didn't seem too strange to me. </p></p>

        <p><p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_O%27Brien_(conspiracy_theorist)</p>
<p>she's been around forever. most people think she's a loony, but she seems to sincerely believe in what she says happened to her. i've always been skeptical, but i have never completely dismissed her.</p>
<p>it seems more scarily possible now than before.</p></p>
