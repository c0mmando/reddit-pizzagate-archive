        <strong>Is the FBI giving us a subtle nod?</strong>
        <p><p>I remember a few weeks ago the made an announcement about busting a darkweb ring, but there weren't a lot of specifics, so I went back to look and saw their news page: https://www.fbi.gov/news  with this video featured: https://www.fbi.gov/video-repository/thailand_feature.mp4/view  </p>
<p>I took screenshots of the page in case it goes down, which you can view here: 
https://sli.mg/a/5enaEb   Interesting that they have an MP4 download of the video, I'm uploading it to Mega right now and will post the link shortly.</p></p>

        <p><p>Have you heard about the FBIAnon leaking on one of the chans back in July (before Pizzagate)?
I think this is what he was suggesting.</p></p>

        <p><p>Here's the original article that was posted on November 1st, the same day the twitter account went active again: https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/a-primer-on-darknet-marketplaces (Backup: https://sli.mg/lHdImb )</p>
<p>Anyone else think it's a possibility that the Clinton Foundation was using darknet markets to sell their sex slaves, and possibly also state secrets?  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s available for sale through illicit DarkNet marketplaces? Typically, products and services involve child sexual exploitation; drugs; guns; chemical, biological, and radiological materials and knowledge; stolen goods; counterfeit goods; and computer hacking tools. Payment for these goods and services is usually through virtual currency like bitcoin, also designed to be anonymous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to line up with everything we believe about The Clinton Foundation, and this article - http://archive.is/CwQsi I saw in here yesterday links Hillary with TOR.  Could also explain the references to Onions we've seen all over the place.  </p></p>

        <p><p>I believe the top parts are, but but I also believe there are also patriots inside the FBI who want to see this blown open even more than we do.  The FBI vault twitter account going active after over a year of silence proves this IMO.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Im sure they call it time travel theory to detract from the time travel fact.  </p>
<p>"According to two National Security US Informants, the Department of Defense developed time travel technology over 40 years ago. As early as 1967, the US government was using a fully operational time travel facility built on Tesla-based quantum access. This technology has been used to keep the construction of military installations secret, as well as provide political and economic advantages by way of knowing what the future holds. Some say the CIA confiscated Tesla’s papers on teleportation shortly after his death." - http://locklip.com/the-secret-cia-time-travel-program/</p>
<p>One of the last people to see Tesla before he died was George Bush Snrs grandfather.  Bear in mind we have been in an information black hole for possibly thousands of years. Its all going to sound a little too far out there at 1st. In any case. Get the pedos. </p></p>

        <p><p>this will blow your mind:</p>
<p>It was <strong>Trump's Uncle - John G Trump</strong> that oversaw the examination of the Tesla papers after his death - one of the projects was said to have been a time travel device.</p>
<p>it is also rumored that Donald Trump knows ALL about it </p>

        <p><p>The upper echelons of government are wholly involved in psy-ops against their own people.  Time travel, aliens, and other craziness - they pretend it's true in order to spread rumor and control those with security clearance so that if they find out about the real stuff (pedophelia and satanism) they can be discredited or otherwise.</p>

        <p><p>The FBI is vehemently anti Clinton. The whole reason Comey went forward with revealing the Weiner emails was to prevent a leak. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yea, that makes sense in theory. But do you really think the globalists and the New World Order would allow a legitimate investigation into her? Or were they just throwing breadcrumbs at the peasants to appease us and give us the impression that the system still works and corruption won't be tolerated, so that we all sit down? I've learned that these people don't make very many mistakes dude. If they do make a mistake, it's buried, and they just pivot and change directions without anybody knowing. They are able to expand and contract to accomodate things like the wiki-leaks releases. I'm on the fence about this. Like the guy above you said, at the top it's probably bought and paid for, but there are a few "cowboys" in the FBI who probably actually legitimately want to oust the corruption. I hope you're right...</p></p>
