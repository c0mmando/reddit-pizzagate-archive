        <p><p>Yea, there's a LOT of information to catch up on. We have found a ton of weird stuff relating to Heavy Breathing - I get the chills just thinking about it. Someone found a very creepy photo of a child on their FB page... they wiped it the next day. It's in the threads here somewhere. </p></p>

        <p><p>No idea since we don't currently have evidence regarding any money they have raised. I posted an analysis of one of their videos and we discussed some further topics relating to them <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cg3at/look_deep_lets_all_take_closer_look_at_heavy/">if you want to check it out here</a></p></p>

        <p><p>Up to you. I am all about seeking the truth, especially when innocent lives are depending on it. But do be mentally prepared. You are going to see some sick and shocking stuff - not just in relation to Heavy Breathing, but in relation to the case as a whole. </p></p>
