        <p><p>They had permission to film there, so know the owners, and presumably are part of the cultural scene in the area. </p>
<p>Don't know anything else except there are slightly sadist and occult imagery involved, dead bodies and dentistry and chloroform; and more. </p>
<p>Don't wanna assume anything more than the fact that it's safe to assume the bands/artists are known by and to people in the area, seen as they are filming there and even in the store, with permission. And we know nothing much else about these artists and their possible connection to the scene.</p>
<p>And we don't know where all the locations are from the videos. Some could be within premises.</p></p>

        <p><p>Kind of a strange, illogical sentence: "[Director] David Combs: Itâ€™s funny to me that the scene reads as being at Trader Joeâ€™s! I thought we were more sly about that. Punks tend to be service industry workers, and I, like the characters in the song, am precariously employed in the service industry. My experience is that musiciansâ€™ network and figure out which businesses are decent to work at and allow flexible schedules, and that network led us to Little Red Fox, a local business which is where we shot the majority of the grocery store sequence. They were actually really stoked to be supporting our art." </p>
<p>Tenuous, but the word "network" is used, in an otherwise kind of illogical sentence.</p></p>

        <p><p>First use of network was a verb. As in 'networking'. Nothing obviously shady here.</p></p>
