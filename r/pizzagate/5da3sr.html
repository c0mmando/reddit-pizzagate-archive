    It would be great if the description was changed to say "civilian investigation" instead of "conspiracy theory".

     They always use the term
     <strong>
      conspiracy theory
     </strong>
     to dismiss something or paint us as kooks.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the truth is that we are not alleging anything,
    </p>
    <p>
     we are just investigating and pointing out the creepy findings.

      Exactly. Someone asked me if I really believe Tony Podesta and Hillary Clinton are abusing children. I explained that of course I don't, I have no proof that such a thing has occurred. I do however believe that they have connections to very weird people involved in sketchy activies and businesses and that while I don't understand exactly what every individual there is up to, it's easy to see that there is some kind of abnormality here, and that the closer you look, more abnormal things surface and connect to other difficult to explain activities.
     </p>

      Keep tugging threads, and perhaps nothing happens, or perhaps maybe, just maybe, a thread gives way and the whole web will begin to untangle. You don't know until you try.

     "Conspiracy theory" as a term is starting to lose its stigma now that it's coming out that many are based in reality.
    </p>
    <p>
     A decade ago if you claimed that the government was listening in to every phonecall and reading the emails of every American citizen, people would instantly shut you down as a wignut. Today we all accept it as understood and proven fact.

      I wish I were as positive as you are about this. To say "we all accept it as understood" is a bit of an overstatement in my opinion. I realize people are waking up to the term being a misnomer, but there are still some that are still too brainwashed to grasp that it's a concept that has more truth than not. They'll just go back to watching the TV and wondering what's going on with Facebook.

       We do not concern ourselves with those people. We don't have enough time in this life to bring every other human up to speed with where we are. There are those that understand, those that are near understanding, and then there's everyone else. We ignore everyone else.

      Precisely. THEY are hard at work to shove this investigation to the crackpot/tinfoil hat corner but I hope that the story is too big and the noble dedication of legions will thwart their insidious plot.

   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Pizzagate is a
     <strong>
      conspiracy theory
     </strong>
     regarding a series of emails hacked from former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s account, which
     <strong>
      some supporters of Donald Trump
     </strong>
     claimed were coded messages discussing an underground pedophile ring operated at the Comet Ping Pong Pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    The term "conspiracy theory" was popularized by the CIA after the Kennedy assassination.  At around the same time the
    <em>
     National Enquirer
    </em>
    , headed by "former" CIA officer Generiso Pope, rose to prominence.  Highly plausible "conspiracy theories" were lumped in with obvious quackery.
   </p>
   <p>
    The term conspiracy theorist has come to mean "anyone who questions powerful people" or engages in critical thinking.   It is thrown around with wild abandon.
   </p>
   <p>
    Much of the public has internalized this propaganda.   We are supposed to believe that even if poor and middle class people are prosecuted for "conspiracy" in the courts everyday, the super rich never do anything illegal, never coordinate to advance their interests, and if they do they are immediately brought to justice by a vigilant law enforcement apparatus.
   </p>
   <p>
    This belief is absurd.   The decflassified history of the CIA itself demonstrates that conspiracies by the rich are the norm, not the exception.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here is a good academic paper on the subject:
    <em>
     Dangerous Machinery: 'Conspiracy Theorist' as a Transpersonal Strategy of Exclusion
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>

    Re: Trump.  I do not support Trump (though would have picked him if forced to choose between Trump and Hillary).   I reckon that half of the posters here are on the left side of the political spectrum.
   </p>
   <p>
    Interesting that they only cite the alleged "food code language" and nothing else.   They don't even mention Jimmy's instagram.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is LAME PROPAGANDA and it's not going to work anymore.

     That's a great paper.

    <p>
     I agree that it is bad propaganda.
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact all of the MSM have become propagandists,
    </p>
    <p>
     They threw everything at trump and still could not beat him,
    </p>
    <p>
     even with electoral fraud on their side.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now they are doubling down on the lies, like this laughable attempt at debunking

     If you want things to change,
    </p>
    <p>
     making a MEME
    </p>
    <p>
     is a great way to BREAK through the MSM censorship
    </p>
    <p>
     and wake people up, so there is REAL change.

        Yeah. Synchronicity is the term coined for "coincidence with meaning."
       </p>
       <p>
        You can take it or leave it because it's linked with occult practice and beliefs (sigils, egregores) and really just depends on your perspective. We're talking about the kind of coincidence that makes your skin crawl and your hair stand on end.
       </p>
       <p>
        Running into someone you know in a store while you're visiting some distant city, that's a coincidence.
       </p>
       <p>
        But say you round that corner thinking about this person because you were reminded of some experience with them by some product you saw on the shelf, then you turn the corner and see them, that could be called synchronicity. It doesn't necessarily have to occur at the same time, but this makes a good example.
       </p>

        A good related video would be this RedIce interview  with
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipohhLbqPGI">
         Rik Clay
        </a>
        . Uncovers tons of numerological, geographical synchronicities regarding 2012 London Olympics. He died very shortly after this aired, apparently suicide. But his dad said "all the attention got to him" and he had an "adrenal breakdown". ...I'll just end with saying that adrenal breakdown usually takes a couple decades of constant medium-high stress. Rick was 20-something.

         I remember seeing a movie a few months ago named Synchronicity,
        </p>
        <p>
         and never looked up the meaning.

   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Pizzagate is a conspiracy theory regarding a series of emails hacked from former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s account, which some
     <strong>
      supporters of Donald Trump
     </strong>
     claimed were coded messages
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Anyone else think this should be updated by now? This has nothing to do with Trump at this point, even it this did start with r/The_Donald.
