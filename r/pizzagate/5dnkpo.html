    Why? You guys do realize that we are documenting and screenshotting every thread you lock and each post you close? Lol, you guys are literally confirming your guilt by doing this. When this thread gets locked, it will only strengthen our argument. But, just so you know, it's too late. We have picked up too much momentum, the sub is growing exponentially, and we have the truth on our side. Enjoy exhausting yourselves and the extreme anxiety and depression that must come with having the task of being a lowly, scumbag "watch dog" for the elite.

   <p>
    Good luck to everyone else, keep fighting.

    This is, for lack of a better term, retarded.  It is a shame we have a bunch of middle schoolers posting retarded shit, getting downvoted then crying fowl... If you post quality content it will be respected.  If you post shit it is going to get downvoted, and in this case, removed/locked because unlike a lot of subs, we are trying to accomplish a common goal.

         And that's not how the "Top" category works. You admit you're new to Reddit and don't understand how the tab sorts work. Your post won't show up on "Top" indefinitely unless it were to maintain attention momentum, same as it won't remain in "Hot" or "Rising" forever. The "New" sort is everything in chronological order. "Top" is a sort based on popularity and other sorting stack methods.
        </p>
        <p>
         Your posts is also still visible to me even when I am logged out. If they were set to hidden they would only be viewable to you when logged in and moderators when they are logged in.

     It's just paranoid idiots who are mad about their shitposts getting removed, and possibly also shills trying to stir up drama to distract us from actually investigating.  If the mods wanted, they could immediately delete any posts claiming mod abuse/shilling. Instead they just locked the comments to prevent it from becoming a big distraction.

    Message the mods. Feel free to pm me too. You can look through my post history, I was shitting on them yesterday but they're not compromised.

    This Subreddit should be used as more of a way to showcase the well documented research to the rest of the world once it has been completed without information that Reddit considers doxxing.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is probably in this Subreddit and everyone heres best interests to keep the bulk of the actual research in the chans, private chat rooms, and anywhere else besides Reddit.

    We have never banned anyone or deleted any comments that did not violate Reddit TOS or our Subreddit Rules.

     Why? You guys do realize that we are documenting and screenshotting every thread you lock and each post you close?

   <p>
    Well, for one images aren't indexed and easily searchable on Google.  Try to find something you remember being deleted using google.  Good luck.

    Get to work on investigating and stop crying about mods.

    The only thing that is being locked is concern trolling.

     Dude, they have locked like every single thread criticizing them. DO i really have to hold your hand and go dig them up and take screen shots? Have you not been paying attention to this sub?

      Perhaps that is because you guys are
      <strong>
       trying
      </strong>
      to shift focus away from the investigation. Which is, you know... THE ENTIRE REASON FOR THIS SUB.
     </p>
     <p>
      The last 3 new posts are the same thing about the mods. Anyone else notice a pattern?

       Dude, go take a look at my post history. My last like, 30 posts are all pizzagate, all promoting further investigation into pizzagate. I am probably among the more frantically obsessed and dedicated users on this sub. My post on /r/conspiracy "We should divert 100% of our focus onto pizzagate" made it to the front page with 1,200 ^ 's. Everybody here has shared a healthy skepticism of the moderators, and frankly, it's pretty amusing the watch them prop up the tiny bit of legitimacy they have left. if you aren't totally full of shit, and actually want to expose this stuff, I advise you to be skeptical as well, as the actions of the moderators directly effect the sharing of information on this sub...

        I am skeptical, we all should be. However, I think your approach is all wrong and posts like this only hurt the movement. It contributes nothing.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a public modlog. Any post I have seen which is locked has a good reason. Most of these new "this sub is compromised" posts are just hot air and never point to any actual wrongdoing.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you are helping the sub as you say, I hope you can get back around to doing actual work and quit with this overreacting.

      Tell me what I should be looking for and I will bring it back. We can also make a shill mods megathread if you want. We are just having a lot of spammers and trolls currently.
     </p>
     <p>
      Edit: I also don't think there is much use in having multiple threads up criticizing the mods. If you want to make sure you aren't being censored  I advise you to visit the 8chan thread.

       Because the mods have tons of control over the sub, so of course their loyalty / the way they decide to run the sub is of importance.

           I hope this is sarcasm on top of sarcasm. I was critiquing the mods, that they were pointing people to suspicious off-site chat rooms. Don't click links containing "matrix" or "rio" or some shit like that. Starts with R.

            See, just look at the language he's using. "Your little witch hunt". You clearly have a bias on this topic. Shouldn't moderators be a neutral party? If you're a moderator with a bias, you can't be trusted..

             I'm just pointing out your own behavior being suspicious from my perspective. Is that ok? Is it ok to disagree? Probably not because your feelings are hurt so you've gone full red-alert and begun to make baseless accusations.

             I have a total bias against shitposters and misdirectors. That's probably why I was invited-- out of the blue-- to help keep troublemaking malcontents out of here and keep the topic on-track.

       It's intentionally irrelevant. Every special, misdirecting snowflake gets butthurt when their shitpost is axed. The ACTUAL contributors who violate the rules pop into mod chat, ask why, and then edit or repost--- they're actually dedicated and want to do it right. They're the backbone of this entire effort. The rest are paranoid or have some victim complex.

        I'll be keeping an eye on you and documenting everything you do with my other accounts. You come off as very untrustworthy.

          Now I'm conflicted. If you encourage people to keep an eye on you, but you're also untrustworthy, would it actually be wise to do so?

           Precisely because I
           <strong>
            am
           </strong>
           trustworthy I encourage it. Disagree with me all you want, but diiversity of ideas/stances is rarely a bad thing. I welcome all criticism based on evidence.

            AHA! But that's exactly what an untrustworthy person would say if they had set a trap as part of their cunning plan!

            The jig is up, PT7! I will, in fact,
            <em>
             not
            </em>
            keep an eye on you in order to thwart your evil schemes! How do you like that, huh?

       I'm trying to raise awareness that the moderators in charge of this sub are sabotaging the spread of information. How the hell is that NOT relevant to the sub? Are you ok man? lol....

       You're being downvoted like crazy. Pretty easy to see what is going on here. There is a war going on and there are two sides:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        People investigating and spreading the news.
       </li>
       <li>
        People trying to distract and spread disinformation.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       It's super easy to see who falls into each category.

         Just upvote the good research/leads and downvote the bullshit. It's really all we can do.
