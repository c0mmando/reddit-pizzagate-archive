<strong>Suggestion: start a wiki site regarding this topic.</strong>
<p><p>Would be great for research and keeping info all in one place. Also great for people that are not into Reddit, a place that's easy to access and read. </p>
<p>Thoughts ?</p></p>

<p><p>Not good. Its already under speculation that posts in this subreddit are being deleted because theres so much talk on it. Not to mention some users have just deleted their accounts unannounced.</p>
<p>Making a wiki would most likely result in it being taken down immediately. This is extremely sensitive information that is obviously being observed very closely</p>
<p>keeping it on reddit would be easier for updates and everyone can add their two cents without having to be a mod at the wiki. </p>
<p>edit: if people dont like the reddit platform, thats fine. theres plenty of other websites to find out about this stuff (tumblr, twitter, 4chan, 8chan, etc)</p></p>

<p><p>So reddit or maybe compromised. What alternatives are there really ? How can we make sure that information won't get lost ?</p></p>
