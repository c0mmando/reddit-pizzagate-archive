    Seriously you people honestly think two of the most scrutinized people in modern history could hide a fucking child sex ring!
   </p>
   <p>
    The entire world knew within a year that Bill fucked the secretary, if they were raping kids we would have known years ago!

    You can't scream when your party is complicit. This goes beyond the two parties and fucking shill retards like you are lowering the discussion and creating stupid political barriers.

    The whole reason this is on the scale that it is is that it's a massive cover up and I'm sure some republicans are involved in it as well. This is not a partisan fight, this is a fight to stop pedophiles who have all the power in the world

     And yet pretty much all the Republicans in charge of impeaching Bill were having affairs of their own.

    this isn't a republican/democrat thing...and frankly if you think it is then that tells me you've done ZERO research into this...it's an elite occult power thing. Kinda like how Kerry-D and Bush- R both refuse to talk about skull and bones

     To be fair when said research involves the occult most people assume it's bullshit.

    From a casual observers stand point. They did get away with a lot over the years. How long did it take people to catch on to the Clinton foundation.

    This post does not reflect my opinion on what is going on with this. Just making a point.

    I don't wanna give you any ideas, but these are really bad childish arguments. You literally sound like Hillary, and we all feel a certain way about her.
