    New to Reddit, so also obviously a new poster here.  Please be kind.  I haven't found any discussion on Amanda Kleinman's (aka Majestic Ape) LinkedIn.  As a mother, if I saw 1/4 of the sh!t she has publicly posted, and she was my child's special education advocate, counselor, or teaching my child "stress reduction" or even their college advisor, I'd raise hell (bad pun) and that's NOT including her involvement with Comet Ping Pong.  This is from her LinkedIn:

    Yup, funny + sad thing is that in her and her friends' eyes, they believe their "music", their "art", their pedophilic "jokes" are "goofy" and totally normal. I wouldn't let my child anywhere near her.

    I don't understand how this post got buried, Im not sure if it is because of everything that happened with posting peoples personal information, but Amanda Kleinman has made herself a very public figure, and I think it is deeply disturbing that she is around children. This needs to be heavily looked at and I agree on the motion of reporting her to police based on the imagery she has used in her bands"artwork".
