        <p><p>Good point on the sociology of a pedo reference. Sad but true. Notice how she points down while telling the crowd they are underneath subway. Great find!</p></p>

        <p><p>".. below a Subway sandwich shop. And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Fogle">Jared</a> is known to hang out down here." </p>
<p>They two guys in the audience just made a joke about him. It's not "out of the blue" as the video-creator says.</p>
<p>Maybe they are a bit weird, but </p>

<p>"100% PROVEN WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK", </p>

<p>Really?</p>
<p>You are probably the same people who hates the media for misleading us.</p>
<p>This is just total bullshit, stop upvoting this crap.</p></p>

<p>The first fucking thing this subreddit tells you is to keep your anonymity. So I created a new account.</p>
<p>Never though about commenting until I saw this shitty post.</p></p>

        <p><p>Children are being bred to be raped. They are kidnapped, tortured, raped, eaten. The evidence is undeniable, and here the person says "everyone has their own tastes" while making references to holding children. 
I don't know what you're getting paid, but it is clear you are involved with protecting pedophiles. 
If you were raped and abused as a child, like most of these people are, Then I feel bad for you. Help us save these children, don't protect their abusers, even if you can justify it for yourself. </p></p>

        <p><p>You have to see the difference in protecting abusers and calling out bullshit articles/videos.</p>
<p>This is not evidence in anyway. It's an offensive joke made in a weird setting. This post is misleading people and is wasting everyone's time. Time that we could be spent finding actual evidence.</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong>: You probably just read this: https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cox0h/how_to_spot_and_counter_pizzagate_shills/</p>
<p>and now you though "OMG, this guy is debunking this 100% PROVED EVIDENCE, HE GOTTA BE A SHILL" and then read what to do with shills:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make the shills feel guilty. Let them know they are supporting pedophilia, murder, and child trafficking</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, you got me.</p></p>

        <p><p><a href="http://www.newnationalist.net/2016/11/11/belgiums-dutroux-pedophile-child-rape-affair-a-road-map-for-deep-state-criminality/">From this article</a>, methods the deep state pedophile networks use to deflect investigation when caught. You seem to be employing three of them:</p>
<p>Knock down straw men. Deal only with the weakest aspect of the weakest charges.</p>
<p>Come half-clean. This is also known as “confession and avoidance” or “taking the limited hang-out route.” This way, you create the impression of candor and honesty while you admit only to relatively harmless, less-than-criminal “mistakes.” This stratagem often requires the embrace of a fall-back position quite different from the one originally taken.</p>
<p>Require the skeptics to solve the crime completely.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm pretty sure they're actually talking about Jared Fogle. So yes in context of all this it's freaky but who didn't make a pedo joke when talking about Subway in 2015 (when this gig happened and the year the Jared pedo shit went down). Also I'm not a shill or anything just trying to stay critical.</p></p>

        <p><p>Transcription of what can be heard in the linked video:</p>
<p>"Anyway, here we are together, and you all are very grateful that you are below a subway sandwich shop [audience: yeah! whooo!] and Jerry [inaudible, maybe Jarod] is there to paying out down here, he likes the world sounds to Mollie's [audience: And little boys! And children!]. I think I was his manager [audience: nooo]. [Creepy laugh]. We all have preferences [evil laugh].</p>
<p>Did I get it right?</p></p>

        <p><p>Which is why they deserve to know about it. People are rioting in the streets(for reasons I don't fully understand) in support of these fascists. If they only knew what these scumbags were really up to.</p></p>

        <p><p>Dude is right though, I have seen articles basically saying the pedophilia is a sexual preference just like being straight or gay. There also is a small subculture on tumblr of "pedo positivity" blogs. Thankfully though mainstream tumblr atleast has some standards and generally loathes these people. </p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if in elite circles they have kind of deluded themselves into believing that; they're so insular and kind of disconnected from reality and what the average person sees as acceptable behavior it seems. It also rationalizes to me how these people could be so damn creepy and on Instagram and social media; normal people just know this behavior is totally weird.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Speaking of Tumblr, if we can get them on board with this, they will be the most powerful weapon against these pedos, at least in terms of raising awareness. Most of them LOTHE pedophiles, and many of the ones that are mentally disabled claim to have gotten that way because they were sexually abused as a child. They jump at opportunities to vehemently rail against those who they think are racist, sexist, transphobic, or homophobic. I doubt pedos can get off scott-free. But we have to convince them, which very well might be near-impossible due to the presence of the occult on Tumblr (then again, they might take the opportunity to self-police) and the scandal's ties to their enemies, 4chan and conservatives.</p></p>
