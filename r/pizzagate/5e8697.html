    I have questions about these comet twitter pics...
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    A few Pictures of jimmy comet ping pongs twitter bring up questions.

    edited to add a link with a few photos and comments:
   </p>

   </p>
   <p>
    I   don't know how to upload them on reddit so you'll have to find them on the link.
   </p>
   <p>
    A few of the pictures are listed below:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <p>
      a photo #politiquedupizza  and #pizzapolitics     Their referring to the political-pizza connection in 2 languages?  That’s really alarming coming from a man who has this photo:
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      bowling with Obama bowling in the background.  Was he photoshopped into the picture?  I can't find  a copy of the twitter   picture with comments on them.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      a picture of Alefantes  and Tony Podesta at a celebration looking at a cake.   I know their into occult  ‘’art’’  that has  ritual implications,  but what the hell does that  cake symbolize?   I don’t think that’s a    normal  cake style that normal people use at large normal   celebrations.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      A letter from Alice,  notifying him that    contacts will be sent.  What contacts?  Who's Alice?
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Alice thanking him for the divine meal at Buck’s and praising him for all his art.   Art has already been described by  Abrahamovic as  code.  Buck's is another of his restaurants.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      there’s a pic of something wrapped in a gunnysack material.      Their members often  use this EXACT TEXTURE and color of fabric.  I've seen it used in his photographers  picture of at least one baby.    Is this  sackcloth fabric important or symbolically ritual?
     </p>

      There are numerous twitter pictures linked to pizzagate involving deer or deer antler.     Comet’s twitter pics show a few references to  deer,    him  at a podium signed  hirschorn, which is german for  deer (Hirsch)  horn (antler).  He owns Bucks fishing and camping, next door to comet ping pong  is.    Buck is a male deer.  What is the reference implication / symbology to    hunting?   I shutter to even think….   Is there pedophilia significance to symbology of deer, or the hunting of deer?  Is  Bucks fishing and camping  a reference?  Does anyone know?   I only found a  pinterest sticker online that says,  “save a deer, hunt a pedophile”     but I haven’t checked deeply on any pedo-deer hunting connections.
      <br/>
      Does anyone have the actual screen shots of commentaries next to hirschorn photos?   Is Hirschhorn the museum in Germany?  or is it code?
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      what's the constant symbolism of Panda?
     </p>
    </li>

      one picture has a small baby next to a woman, photographed at comet ping pong.  They’re both looking into the camera; the woman could be the mother – they look identical.   This photo is missing the  comments, but other screen snaps show the the comments  are directed to two twitter accounts in German, saying,  “gefallt das”, which is poor German grammar meaning, “does this suit you”.  “do you like this, or do you want this.”  “is this to your taste.”
     </p>

     <p>
      a picture of a small baby holding a stuffed toy chicken.  Chicken is pedo code.   Coincidence?  And why so many men with small babies who all have blonde hair and blue eyes?
     </p>

      a map of a farm shows designated areas for  black sows, green sows, blue sows, red sows.     I grew up on a farm and a friend lived on an actual pig   farm and this isn’t normal.  Color coding is however very important to occult rituals.  Does anyone know where this farm is located?
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      there’s a pic of a living room with a very large  ‘’ART’   mural on the wall.   The art looks like something you’d see in a police evidence warehouse,  but I’m not able to magnify it for further details.
     </p>

     <p>
      a photo says: 6 secrets to success, the pizza diet. ….    ((Yeah right)).
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      photo of a penis ejaculating pizza.

    ** I imagine pedo perverts are peeing themselves all over the world, deleting and scrubbing their tracks and buying new computers.  I wonder if new computer and mobile phone sales will go up in the month of November.     I hope they have many fearful, sleepless night of worry.
