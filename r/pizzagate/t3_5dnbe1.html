        <strong>Where did the police sketches come from?</strong>
        <p><p>Who was rhe witness that gave these descriptions?</p>
<p>How and where did they see the abduction?</p>
<p>Is there anyway to link the podestas there in that time frame?</p>
<p>Also it doesnt seem like theyre the ones perpetrating the abductions themselves... and how cpuld they get her out of Paraguay or portugal? Seems not impossible but certainly not probable they could get her out. I guess she was young so they could tell her theyre on the way to bring her back to her parents or something</p></p>

        <p><p>This isn't a stretch at all.  The McCann's hired a private investigative team comprised of former MI5 spies.  They produced a report implicating what I believe, is a sex ring comprised of powerful people.  That report was suppressed for 5 years.</p>

        <p><p>Since the sighting was on the beach, I assumed they had a boat waiting for them.</p></p>
