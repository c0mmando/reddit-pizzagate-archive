        <p><p>I've seen a few stars over the years talk about how prevalent child molestation is in media production, but no one cares and the story never sticks long enough for anyone to do anything. </p>
<p>A redditor did an ama that wasn't that popular, but he claimed to be a child star, and wouldn't claim the show he was on. But we narrowed it down to who we are sure it is. He was basically coming out trying to say how much he was molested during the entire filming of his childhood.</p></p>

        <p><p>Elijah Wood and Corey Feldman have both made claims of rampant pedophilia in Hollywood. </p>
<p>Wood said that child stars are brought out to Hollywood, paid vast sums of money (to the parents) and then are preyed upon by "vipers". </p>
<p>Feldman said that he and many others were "passed back and forth" at parties for the elite.  He also mentioned that many agents were not only complicit but also facilitated these parties. </p>
<p>Doubt that is who OP is talking about, still disturbing nonetheless. </p></p>

        <p><p>I mean, it bounced around some alt media sources for awhile, Feldmans too.  </p>
<p>The MSN is owned by the same people he was accusing so it's not too hard to see why it wasn't picked up. </p>
<p>FWIW John the Baptist condemned the Jews as a “brood of vipers” in Matthew 3:7. Jesus repeated this  to them (Jews) in Matthew 12:34.  Not sure how much EW knows of the scripture but it is a strange choice of words given the demographics of the Hollywood elite. </p></p>

        <p><p>i used to be big on the jew conspiracy but tbh i think its now 100% more likely that "jews" are actually these satanistic globalists doing spirit cooking and child trafficking. it does kinda fit in doesnt it? globalists would have wanted WW2, holocaust fitted their agenda &amp; also gave them a "moral shield" from anything by saying people are anti semitic. whilst i bet they cant even quote a single line from Torah. </p></p>

        <p><p>No offense, but you have no idea what you're talking about if you believe this.  Have you actually RESEARCHED this subject? The Franklin Scandal?  The Finders?  The Presidio Scandal? The Dutroux Scandal?  In EVERY CASE, the few people that DID talk were immediately discredited by a complicit press, cops that were on the take or involved, and corrupt gov't ministers.</p>
<p>This has been going on ALL too long for anyone to rely on 'someone will talk'. The EVIDENCE is that when people DO talk, things end badly.</p>
<p>You simply aren't understanding how evil these people are.  And also wonder where all the victims are.  Because the ONLY ones who WOULD talk are the victims--and they are mostly silent...probably because they are dead.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is a strange post and the whole idea that our government is this involved in some kind of satanic pedophilia cult is just too unbelievable....but I was lurking through these posts and comments and coincidentally a Robin Williams movie called "The Night Listener" is on in the background in my home. Just kind of creeped me out and as a father I only hope that this is all tinfoil. How did Robin get dragged into this web of lies? Please don't think I'm trying to take away from the digging but all of this is just so sickening and hopefully those of you spending so much time looking at this stuff don't go completely insane. </p></p>
