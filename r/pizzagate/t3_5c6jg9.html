<p><p>Podesta emails released
Pizza references found
Thought it was related to a money laundering scheme that was found earlier
Looked to a friend of John Podesta who owns a ping pong place
His Instagram is filled with creepy shit/friends. All of the buildings around the ping pong place are owned by Clinton foundation and friends of it
Different audio files from different emails and a connection to a Swedish ping pong place that had a link on how to put files in audio files.
Other weird connections throughout. You'll just have to look back into the history of it to find everything, but this is wild.</p></p>

<p><p>good point. I think OP maybe didn't make the literal connection. Just a simple quick blurb about exactly what is happening for stupid inattentive adults is what I think rhey are trying to say we need.</p></p>

<p><p>TLDR: Shit's wack, yo.</p>
<p>Illuminati control members through blackmail. </p>
<p>Clinton's funded by people funding ISIS.</p>
<p>Podesta (Clinton campaign chairman) runs an international child trafficking ring.</p>
<p>Clintons were in charge of relief efforts in Haiti. Little relief happened with the billions, but massive child abductions occured.</p>
<p>Podesta is heavily into spirit cooking, along with many others in the DNC.</p>
<p>Putin stated in 2009 that he would destroy the Illuminati.</p>
<p>Putin is blamed for everything by the DNC.</p>
<p>The US is installing missile systems around Russia.</p>
<p>Podesta has a weird alien obsession.</p>
<p>Jeffery Epstein has his own island and a plane called the lolita express. 
These are frequently visited by the Clintons.</p>
<p>There are several businesses close to each other in DC that have strong connections to Podesta and others in the child trafficking ring.</p>
<p>Construction photos of underground tunnels being dug and hidden rooms under these businesses.</p>
<p>Business owners social media and instagram accounts support theory of severe child abuse/torture related to spirit cooking claims.
Also appear to sell children.</p>
<p>Everything we know about magnets is WRONG. Every pump/motor/generator/etc. in the world is operating on deeply flawed science. </p>
<p>FBI file on Tesla was released.</p>
<p>Tesla could induce voltage at ranges of up to 200 miles with accuracy. </p>
<p>This would have removed the necessity of a power grid.</p>
<p>Tesla claimed to have establish comms with aliens.</p>
<p>CIA created the term conspiracy theory to give instant doubt to anyone exposed to said theory.</p>
<p>So, in short: Child trafficking / satan worshiping cult almost took over the US to start WW3, aliens may exist and be using us as a TV show because reasons. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xEwbzEBw14">Everything you know is wrong</a></p>
<p>Edit: The longer Clinton was in the race, the more the internet focused on uncovering the extent of the pedofile cult. We know Soros owned ALL of the voting machine companies in the US, and the election went the way it did because it was allowed by the established cult. The cult is STILL IN POWER. By causing Clinton to lose the election, and letting CTR appear to disappear, they can focus on suppressing the DAPL and Child trafficking / cult ring, there by insulating themselves from being uncovered any further. THEY HAD TO PULL THE PLUG ON HER TO SAVE THEMSELVES!!!!!!!!! </p>
<p>Nobody knows Trumps real policies. </p>
<p>The CIA runs half to two thirds of the child porn sites on the dark web.</p>
<p>CPS is a source of children for the child trafficking ring.</p>
<p>The Clinton's created the entities that would prosecute them and placed people in charge that would do the exact opposite.</p>
<p>Everything they claim that others are doing, they are actually doing behind closed doors.</p>
<p>Obama made it legal to prosecute journalists, jail people without trial, and drone strike inside the US.</p>
<p>The EM drive works far better than we thought was possible.</p></p>
