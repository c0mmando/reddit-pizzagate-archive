        <p><p>Yes they should. And they should continue to speculate on a whole slew of things that will never actually EVER be acted upon. Somewhere out there this truth exists that the world is trying to cover up! You're so right! Just look at this trove of well documented, intelligibly written pieces of news are out there!  The trials and tribulations of the internet troll.</p>
<p>So I encourage the nothings of the world to keep digging and....Yes! You can be the next Bob Woodward!</p>
<p>We'll be here watching and shaking our heads at how perverted some imaginative minds can get.</p></p>

        <p><p>I actually do know...and am sadly the first and only person from the Comet side of things to respond this shitstorm of conspiracy, but it's not true. We 110% encourage any and all investigation. Honest to god. Unfortunately the last week and a half has only proven that a troll is just that, a troll. Thanks for finding nothing better to spend your time doing. </p>
<p>I'm running the risk of getting sucked into this weird Alex Jones-like 'I'm world of using the internet as a means of filling a void in my life' spiral of death but there are so many of you people out there saying sooooo many fucking things, I really wish you'd actually do something about it. </p>
<p>Fellow humans, I have to tell you now, out of empathy from one to another, you're barking up the wrong tree. </p>
<p>Put your money where your mouth is or shut the fuck up</p></p>

        <p><p>Or I guess you could just make a post telling people they should write a book about 'this'.</p>
<p>Bravo! You have contributed nothing to this world, never will, but will relentlessly talk about it until you're blue in the face. </p>
<p>Try putting yourself in someone else's shoes before trying to give yourself a sense of purpose at the expense of others. Deep down you know, that no matter how badly you want to believe this, it's nonsense. I guess I can't personally put myself in the shoes of an internet troll until now but I'm trying. </p>
<p>Take action! Ground troops! Bad memes! Ms Paint! Bad grammar! Or something like that, at least I tried...</p></p>

        <p><p>You sound very emotional about all this. If it's a conspiracy and we are all loonies, what's the harm let us all be loonies. </p></p>
