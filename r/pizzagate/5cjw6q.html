    I remembered a post along these lines and came across this one (possibly others I will keep searching). I went to the direct link on their
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     http://www.veteranstoday.com/2015/02/22/anonymous-leaks-satanic-cult-member-names-places-phone-s/
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    ...but the post is not visible and there seems to be an 'error', so I checked the bottom of the page and their is an archive search link so I selected the date associated with this article 'Feb2015' and scrolled to the place it should be but nothing was there.. someone deleted this article/post!! I checked on archive.is and was somehow able to recover previous versions of this article/post and here it is! I think this is relevant to our investigation !
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     EDIT: this more recent (28Feb2016) archive.is has more comments ( I just chose the first one) http://archive.is/K42FH
    </li>
    <li>
     EDIT2: this is from ( or in connection with) Anonymous' 'Operation Death Eaters'

    I'm not sure if this is in the article as I haven't got the time to read it all right now. I did look into this a few weeks ago. Alisa and Gabriel later claimed that the whole story was made up and they were coached to lie by their step father. This doesn't add up to me, because it was supposedly the mother and stepfather trying to get the biological father locked up, but if that were the case, why involve all the teachers of the school in the story with details that could easily be proven untrue (secret basement in Mr. Hollings house for example)? Medical reports show that both Alisa and Gabriel had injuries consistent with their story. So either the step dad was raping them, or their story is true but they were somehow convinced to tell the detectives it was all made up. When Gabriel was called out by the detective that he was lying, Gabriel didn't say the whole thing was a lie, he just said he exaggerated how often they killed babies, whereas Alisa admitted the whole story was made up. I believe the mother and step father fled the country and the children are now in foster care. Alisa says she has nightmares every night about her father killing them. The full interviews are online but they often get taken down so it's hard to find them.

    for anyone interested in digging into this. Warning, if this is true, it's extremely sickening. This little girl is talking about beheading and eating babies and she isn't even fazed by any of it. Really horrible to watch.

    Guys, this could easily be disinformation.  We haven't even verified where this was originally posted, let alone WHO posted it.  DO NOT spread until we can verify somehow.  The fact that the poster provided no evidence is a potential red flag.

     Where is that photo from?!  It's just there with no mention of where it came from.

     Edit: I did reverse image search, and it looks like it's from Brazil.  Has nothing to do with what supposedly happened at Christchurch.

    Aren't these people Lucifernian rather than Satanic?  One rule in Satanism is to not hurt little children.

      No, this is a very common pattern. Shills will push sensational shit, newcomers and lurkers be like "zomg like in the movies!!" and they -- intentionally or not -- derail any serious discussion. They will lose interest and the veterans remain if they don't make the mistake and leave discouraged by the influx of stupid.
