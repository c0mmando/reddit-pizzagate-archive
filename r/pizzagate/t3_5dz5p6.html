        <strong>A thought about "pasta"</strong>
        <p><p>The podesta email about dominos on cheese or pasta made we wonder about the difference between the two.</p>
<p>Could it be that cheese = child (CP) and pasta = adolescent?  Pasta is best al dente, a place between raw and cooked.  That sentence sure makes more sense in that context than boy vs. girl.</p></p>

        <p><p>Pasta, coke, and kale salads, marijuana, are drug terms. Sometimes cooked pasta, crack, is used. Not to be conflated with pizzas and handkerchiefs. </p></p>
