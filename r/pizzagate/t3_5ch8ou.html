        <strong>Eyes Wide Shut FULL of Creepy References That are Now Very Relevant to our Cause</strong>
        <p><p>Final Scene Here -&gt;&gt; <strong>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4w7Ley4dMI</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the men walk away and disappear from the shot, Helena appears to follow them … and we don’t see her for the rest of the movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two men behind Helena happened to be at Ziegler’s party at the very beginning of the movie. (screen shot below)</p>

<p><strong>ALSO</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last scene of the movie takes place at a toy store – a place full of highly symbolic items. Here, Helena Harford walks by a toy called Magic Circle – showing that the occult elite’s ways seep through popular culture, but are not noticed by those who have their eyes wide shut.</p>

<p>Bill discovers in the newspaper that Amanda was found dead in a hotel room due to an overdose. The way in which this ritualistic murder is disguised as an overdose is highly similar to the many celebrity ritual deaths disguised as overdoses that occur in real life.</p>

        <p><p>His Sublimeness The God Emperor and President Elect of the Free World knows. </p>
<p>He knows. At the Al Smith dinner when he roasted everyone there, he made a comment that turned Hillary <em>white</em>. He said:</p>
<p>"As Hillary is fond of saying, it takes a village. She should know because she's taken several in Haiti."</p>
<p>My bet is he is already assembling a team to take as many of these animals down as possible simultaneously. He's no fool. He's had excellent sources for many years. He used to be on the edge of the elite although never part of it. </p></p>

        <p><p>Something to keep in mind is that after Obama and Trump spoke to each other, one prez to another, Trump said that he expected the meeting to last 15 mins, but it lasted nearly 90 mins and could have gone longer. He also said that he wishes to meet up with Obama in the future and that he would like to keep Obama as 'council'. What if Obama just dropped a massive redpill down Trumps throat and offered to uncover this pedo ring in exchange for protection/amnesty?</p>
<p>Edit:Or what if Obama is going to compromise or in some way dissuade Trump?</p></p>

        <p><p>Well something was obviously said between them, Trump was <em>very</em> conciliatory and respectful toward Obama, if you analyse his body language it was quite submissive, I don't think I've ever seen a submissive Trump. Trump also let slip about Americas 'high flying assets' which is interesting. Trump was also very eager to retain Obama as a counselor and they both said they wanted to continue to meet and speak.</p>
<p>Interesting relationship that'll develop between those 2.</p></p>

        <p><p>MooIt's fascinating to watch. Lord only knows what Obama has seen or intuited in his various government roles. Trump has gone down the rabbit hole. He looked frankly shocked, he was so pale and meek. It must have been either a rude awakening about conspiracies or Intel or Trump realized he's going to be middle management in an organization that wants him destroyed. </p></p>

        <p><p>Trump was in Epstein's little black book. It could be nothing and just a normal celebrity contact but there is a real possibility that he's stuck in this too. Although I really hope that it means that he's been involved with it just enough to have the power to take it down.</p></p>

        <p><p>Have you seen the picture of Trump with his daughter as a young teen? His comments and behavior indicate incestual attraction and an inability to recognize the proper boundary between a father and daughter. Perving after your own child is a very narcissistic personality disorder type behavior. </p>
<p>We also know Trump got his rocks off watching the teens and young women undressing at Ms. America pageants. </p>
<p>Nothing would surprise me. </p></p>

        <p><p>Damn, once this shit broke I knew I needed to watch this movie again. Kubrick has symbols/references in ALL of his movies and huge amounts in this one. Like others have said, he died before the movie actually came out. And I'm sure you guys have made the connection, but Nicole Kidman is the main actress in this, and her father was linked to a pedo-ring a few years ago and died before his trial</p></p>

        <p><p>Scientology matches powerfully closeted gay people for marriages that protect their careers. Then they extort them. In the lgbt gossip communities online, it's widely accepted that stars like Kidman, Cruise, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett, and Travolta are queer and closeted. Any time stars meet through scientology or one is very devout, you should question whether they're in an arranged "lavender marriage." </p></p>

        <p><p>i think its time that someone, somehow, manages to get into one of those parties and get as much intel as they can and exploit it right here on fucking reddit. this shit's gone too far. I remember when I was about 4-years old some old white lady followed me around the mall after I'd branch off from my mother to go with my cousins, and I see now that had I not took my happy ass down to the food court and sat with another family as she galloped past in her fucking black trench coat and dark sunglasses and redlipstick, I would've been one of these kids and it hurts me to my heart, man.</p></p>

Did you also catch the conversation between Alice and that older man who dances with her at the Christmas party? He said he was a successful art dealer... made me think of Podesta's taste in art, and the whole money-laundering through art sales thing...</p></p>

        <p><p>That's funny, I never heard about money laundering through the art trade, but I came to that conclusion on my own. I don't see how else the world's most expensive art is ever bought by anyone. It's all terrible.</p></p>

        <p><p>This film has been known to be an expose of the Illuminati/NWO since its release.</p>
<p>Kubrick was getting old and knew he only had one more movie in him, so he went down sticking it in their craw.</p></p>

        <p><p>And Kubrick died 6 days later after the film's release. His daughter never wants to talk about this film. But thankfully Alex Jones does talk about this film, and much much more. </p></p>

<p>The way in which this ritualistic murder is disguised as an overdose is highly similar to the many celebrity ritual deaths disguised as overdoses that occur in real life.</p>
