    I took a brief look at the wifi access points visible at the addresses of Comet/Besta Pizza (as provided by Wigle.net) and noticed that there is one AP of particular interest in the area.
   </p>
   <p>
    ESSID: Buck's and Comet
BSSID: 20:C9:D0:26:08:D3
Security: None.
Last scanned: 8/14/2016
   </p>
   <p>
    This AP may be a internet connection owned by Comet Ping Pong and the people running Buck's Fishing and Camping the next door over. If someone could connect to this network via smartphone, run a Fing scan, and then upload the results, it could potentially prove useful. I'd be curious to see what kind of devices are connected to this network. Do not attempt to log into the router interface with default credentials or perform any illegal actions.
   </p>
   <p>
    Fing is available on the Android and Apple official app stores, and I am guessing you can get it on F-droid or Aptoide if you don't use the Google services framework. Just connect to the network normally, ensure there is no special authentication needed, and then open Fing and scan. If you have messages you can contact me privately. I would prefer a more experienced script kiddie with a rooted device who can change their MAC address for an extra layer of anonymity.

    Godspeed, pizza hunters.
