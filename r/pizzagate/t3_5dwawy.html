        <strong>Could the Pentagon be involved with selling children? Hear me out.</strong>
        <p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYWbVSY2oPg</p>
<p>This is from a <em>2011</em> CNN report. There were investigations into the Pentagon as literally <em>thousands</em> of people had downloaded child porn.</p>
<p>I don't know how many people work there, but 1700 people were left not investigated as they closed it down.</p>
<p>I got to thinking that there is no way <em>that many people</em> are getting their rocks off to child porn. </p>
<p>But what if pictures were downloaded/sent of underage children that were being sold or "shopped"? </p>
<p>I have seen so much shit now, that this could be something. </p>
<p>If all these thousands of people are involved - there has to be many thousands more. </p>
<p>The reason the Supervisors didn't get in shit is probably because <em>they</em> were involved too - and now I think the investigators may have been too.</p>
<p>Fuck.</p></p>

        <p><p>Apparently pedophilia is just totally rampant.  Every time they bust a ring, its always tens of thousands of people involved - you can guarantee there are thousands of rings that just get away with it.  And it does appear structured, which implies that there is a puppet master</p></p>

        <p><p>Sort of makes you wonder if they're organized like terrorist cells, where each ring only knows other people in that same ring. Maybe there's somebody at the top of all of them, and we've just blown it wiiiiiiiide open</p></p>

        <p><p>Yea - basically how the mafia crime families ran.  They were essentially out of contact of one another aside from boss meetings, and they operated independently.  Limited exposure from one another is basically a safe guard to keep the whole industry from collapsing.  I wouldnt say that we've blown it open though - still limited to basically speculation</p></p>

        <p><p>I think all of this discussion of terrorism is meant to be a really big distraction to keep the people from noticing the far more important issues. It is a manufactured cover up story. </p></p>

        <p><p>You'll notice there are literally hundreds of organisations combatting CP and trafficking, millions of dollars being funded for the best surveillance and intercept yet only a handful of people each week are brought to justice and that's because they can divert the investigations to the small Fry while protecting the big players.</p></p>
