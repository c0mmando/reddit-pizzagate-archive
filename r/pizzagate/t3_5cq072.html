        <strong>READ! Archive! - Dec. 16th: FOSTERCARE</strong>
        <p><p>Sorry, I see now that this is from 2010, but the information is still relevant. </p>

Thursday, Dec. 16
"At Comet on Thursday night, five bands will churn out short, fast and loud songs that should inspire enough trashing about to keep bodies warm in these bitterly cold days. The headliners are Brooklyn's Ex-Humans, a trio that plays a no-nonsense brand of punk, equal strong on the heavy and the hooks. The same can be said of locals the Shirks, who earlier this year released one of 2010's best singles, local or otherwise. Foster Care, Hollywood and the Furries make it a packed evening."</p>
<p>A band called Foster Care?

<p>Considering the Furries are mentioned, I'm pretty sure most of us are aware that aside from furry animal costumes being used to entertain children at theme parks, it's also a sexual fetish.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Considering that Mall of America is in Minnesota, here's a webpage advertising Minnesota's first Ping Pong tournament (2013) to benefit charity.
http://anchorageparkfoundation.org/2013/08/minnesota-ping-pong/</p>
<p>When you scroll down a bit, it's strange that the only question they asked participants is what their favorite pizza topping is. Take note that the address where it's being held is 33rd Ave. Most of us are familiar with 33 being a Masonic number. 
"CHECK OUT THE COMPETITION:</p>
<pre><code>Kris, East Anchorage. Skill Level = “I am good.” Fave pizza topping = meat-lots of meat

J.R., South Anchorage. Skill Level = “Better than Forrest Gump.” Fave pizza topping = sriracha
