        <strong>Are there any LIT. BFA's in this sub?</strong>
        <p><p>If so, your poor choice in collegiate careers in the liberal arts COULD be of dramatic practical use!
In consuming these posts and diving down the rabbit hole myself I feel there's an abundant need for a master thread to organize timelines, POI's, evidence and conjecture into a cohesive grouping of Minutes.
I'm no mod, I'm just making a suggestion that we all need to remember our strengths, personal connections, and backgrounds, and use them to benefit this investigation.</p></p>
