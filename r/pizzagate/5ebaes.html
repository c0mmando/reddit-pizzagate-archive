    Title: Hillary runs prostitution ring in pizzeria? All lie
   </p>
   <p>
    http://veja.abril.com.br/mundo/hillary-comanda-rede-de-prostituicao-em-pizzaria-tudo-mentira/
   </p>
   <p>
    They said that are all lie but in the article is written "the FBI didn't deny or confirm any investigation"
   </p>
   <p>
    Also, they didn't even mention about pedophilia (the main case), really suspect!

    Are you on the ground in Brazil? (if yes, Is your mainstream media just as corrupt as in the USA?)
   </p>
   <p>
    Also as a side-note, the FBI does not comment on what they're investigating. Using that as an indicator that something has validity or not isn't generally accurate.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, according to statements in this interview with Erik Prince indicate that the NYPD has kept a copy of all of the emails (650,000+) to force the hand of the FBI to investigate.

     Yes, I am in Brazil. Yes, our media is corrupt, they see their own interests and runs on it. Our political system is one of the most corrupts in the world, and unfortunately, this reflects on society.
    </p>
    <p>
     Our media did the same job as american against Trump. He is seen as racist here. Look, i am not right or left and I really hate any manipulation from media and I see this all day in media reports.
    </p>
    <p>
     I started reading about elite globalism and everything comes together. George Soros invests in brazilian foundations to plant chaos (people are getting more and more extremists here). Now we have a president that will try to implement parliamentarism which meets the interest of the elite globalists.
    </p>
    <p>
     My country is just a pawn in this whole process, maybe that's why they aren't using brute force here.

    Incorrect points:

   <blockquote>
    <p>
     prostituição infantil, comandada pela ex-candidata à Presidência Hillary Clinton, além de outras figuras do Partido Democrata.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    No, no one here has said Hillary is in charge of it, or that it is a "prostitution ring" - the point has been about sexual abuse &amp; trafficking
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     A amizade casual com pessoas da cena política, além do antigo relacionamento com um jornalista defensor de Clinton, foram suficientes para transformar Alefantis e seu restaurante nos parceiros de uma falsa rede criminosa
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Purely minimizing it: No, it is not "casual friendship" to be in the top 50 most powerful people in Washington and have politicians hold fundraisers at your restaurant. ALSO, Tony Podesta at various times was named the #1 most powerful lobbyist in Washington who was KNOWN to come to this place. I believe even Barack Obama had been there.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     o boato iniciou em fóruns e sites conservadores e se espalhou rapidamente para o Reddit, onde foi lido por 20.000 usuários
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    No again, "conservative forums" did not originate it. Reddit did. Also, there are a hell of a lot more people than just this sub looking at it. Counting all the subscribers of T_D, Wikileaks, DNCLeaks, H4P, Conspiracy, and this sub, it could be well over 500k.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Logo começou a ler ameaças de morte, links para sites de notícias falsas e até vídeos com “provas” do crime.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    The obligatory Fake News reference, which in the article is followed by Alefantis's quote from the NYT which is poor form because
    <em>
     of course if you ask someone whether they are guilty of abetting a pedophilia ring they will deny it
    </em>
    .

    OP let me know if I have made any bad errors
