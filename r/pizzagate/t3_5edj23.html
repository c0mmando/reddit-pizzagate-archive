        <strong>Baby Farm Infant Development Center</strong>
        <p><p>This just makes me feel uncomfortable and 
seems suspicious.  Figured I would share.</p>

<p>Tuition costs seem just a tad high...
http://www.babyfarmabq.com/tuition</p>
<p>especially with how the place looks: </p>
<p>https://www.google.com/maps/@35.1109497,-106.5155561,3a,15y,71.35h,85.37t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sRRqKx4Rb5YTACyu3ARZsHw!2e07i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 </p>
<p>Plus the average cost of a full time Nanny is less than that.</p>
<p>http://archive.is/MMg1Y</p>
<p>They have 2-10 employees and only take personal checks/cash</p>
<p>http://archive.is/3SD9O</p>
<p>Cares for &lt; 5 children?</p>

<p>Even the facebook page seems odd, not many 
pictures for a daycare that costs that much 
and has been open since 2008.</p>

<p>Partner's with CYFD (New Mexico Children, 
Youth &amp; Families Department)</p>

<p>I just wanted this out there for anyone that may live near that area.  Could be nothing or something.</p></p>

        <p><p>You're comparing MONTHLY daycare cost with WEEKLY nanny cost. This is actually on the low end of daycare costs, and most facilities only take cash or check. I'm tired of this hysteria. </p></p>

        <p><p>Which is why I posted it saying it could be nothing for others to downvote/upvote if it is/is not something.</p></p>

        <p><p>Okay, I downvoted it. Do you realize you doxxed someone who is most likely just an innocent caregiver? </p></p>
