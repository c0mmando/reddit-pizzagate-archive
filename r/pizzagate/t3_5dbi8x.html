        <strong>Is #pizzagate trending big in Turkey a deliberate attempt to put off American twitter users from investigating?</strong>
        <p><p>I find it very odd that #pizzagate is attracting the most attention in Turkey. It seems like 80% of tweets about #pizzagate are in Turkish.  I realise the story featured on a big circulation Turkish website, but is  this a deliberate plant so that the hashtag gets flooded with non English tweets and so deflects attention from US tweeters from investigating?</p></p>

        <p><p>Lots of web commercials ,links, floods in turkish facebook and sites like 9gag(turkish one) ppl r clicking link reading topic and starts sharing at everywhere thats how turkish system works -  our ppl  love to make rumors about anythng . And most of 'm dont speak english (just like me lol) thats why there r lots of #pizzagate tags and turkish bullshits / 
but "still why turkey? " thats good question maybe cause we got cases in turkey called "ensar vakfÄ±" almost same subject related with government child abuse etc etc and ppl started caring , dunno </p>
<p>Finally ; </p>

        <p><p>you should search about pedophilia scandal about Ensar foundation which related to Erdogan's government. Its just covered in a few days. They simply just say that to their haters: "you love America(also Europe) so much and hate us because of that. they are scurvier than us." -yes i live in turkey unfortunately. </p></p>

        <p><p>Helsinki Finland was yesterday's most searched.  It's just making waves across the world the more exposure it gets imo</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't think that can hurt spreading of the news by any means. And it is actually a shame that so many people are not interested in this. Also check social media searches at google trends and see how popular social media is, in Turkey. That popularity might be a long time deliberate plan though.</p></p>

<p>Edit:  In other words, the failed coup may connect Turkish motivation to stir virility. </p></p>
