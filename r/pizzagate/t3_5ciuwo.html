        <strong>A professional psychologist's lecture on Multiple Personality Disorder and it's connections to Ritual Abuse (which is possibly at the root of all these pedo rings). EVERYONE IN HERE NEEDS TO WATCH THIS.</strong>

        <p><p>nononononono. some of multiple personality is related to abuse and rituals. that doesn't mean that any significant number of rituals/abuse are related to multiple personality. multiple/split personality is much, much, much rarer than abuse.</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the wording is a bit awkward, but the title isn't meant to imply this at all, only that people have linked the two. </p>
<p>The MPD itself is practically irrelevant the context of everything that's going on. However, it seems that professionals dealing with MPD cases seem to have a disproportionate number of these ritual abuse victims coming to them. And as of now, the MPD research community seems to be the most detailed and <em>credible</em> source on this whole ritual abuse thing that I've come across, because they all seem to have independently stumbled upon the same information practically by accident.</p></p>

        <p><p>MPD is often understood in the context of TV shows and movies- if I remember the stats right it's less than 10% that have this stereotypical presentation. </p>
<p>MPD is an outdated term and frames the illness in terms of alters. The new terminology, Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) gets at the crux of what you are really looking at - dissociation that occurs at the level of identity (and in most cases has little to do with what we think of as 'alters.') </p>
<p>In terms of programming you can't really understand the extent of control unless you really understand what dissociation is, how it occurs (necessity of reoccurring abuse and ritual aspect amplifies that effect), and how it plays out when it's worked in at a structural level. </p></p>
