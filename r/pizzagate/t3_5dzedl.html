        <strong>Stay safe but screenshoot/download everything which might get deleted</strong>
        <p><p>Hi redditors. 
I want to make sure at first that i dont want you to download CP or other illegal stuff. But we need to make sure that everything get saved which might be important. So i want you to Screenshot important threads or download yt Videos with evidence or which might get deleted. Stay safe.</p></p>
