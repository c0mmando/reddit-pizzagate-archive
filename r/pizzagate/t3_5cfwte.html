        <p><p>You know, I really didn't want to believe anything in this sub or r/conspiracy, but all of this evidence is really starting wear me down. This review in particular is very suspicious. </p></p>

        <p><p>this review was compiled by a Zagat's computer program that auto tags and highlights phrases that people search for. </p>
<p>Like "unsupervised children running around" would be a pretty bad thing for me. </p></p>

        <p><p>This seems to be something the website (zagat) did, not the reviewer. The quotes/bold seems to be a sort of 'tag' that shows key phrases associated with the restaurant (google play does a similar thing by grouping reviews on apps). <a href="https://www.zagat.com/r/amelies-petite-charlotte">Unrelated French bakery in Charlotte</a> and any other restaurant has the same kind of thing, for reference.</p></p>

        <p><p>I have been to that french bakery, that review seems pretty spot on. </p>
<p>Attracts hipsters, lots of people camp out. Excellent for people watching (especially if you go to their uptown location) Good pastries. </p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not sure what you're seeing there that's out of the ordinary? It's describing a pizza place that has ping-pong tables for kids (or whoever) and in the night they have live music.</p></p>

        <p><p>It seems weird to address that there are "unsupervised children" running around.</p></p>

        <p><p>Pop on over to r/TalesFromYourServer or yelp and you will find hundreds of people talking about unsupervised children in restaurants.</p></p>
