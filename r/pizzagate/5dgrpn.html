    Russia bans adoption by people from US....
Like I've said before Putin is the King of this underworld. He knows everything.

    Good job! I had known about this but completely forgot about it. Like you said. Putin knows everything. He is playing a chess game with the people who try to run things and he is always several steps ahead of them. This definitely could be the reason behind Russia banning adoptions.

    There was 5 different entities that hacked Clinton's server.  It's strongly believed Russia is one of them. This would be a reasonable response to what was uncovered, and just further corroborates that.  Especially in light of Russia's very vocal welcoming of Trump.

    I don't think gays should be allowed to adopt children.
   </p>
   <p>
    When gays adopt children, they do it for status or bragging rights or out of boredom as if the child is some kind of exotic pet.   A pet that will have their master's will imposed upon it.
   </p>
   <p>
    I see this again and again.  An adopted child to a gay couple seems to be little more than a high-fashion status symbol to be paraded around on social media and shopping trips.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have never seen a gay man who isn't narcissistic.

     Putin realizes that Russian culture is highly homophobic and used that to his advantage. You don't think he gets a report on his desk about the countless child pornography, child kidnappings, child rape etc. that is going on in US. How many times does this come up on the news. How many celebrities go to jail for child pornography or child rape.
    </p>
    <p>
     Don't you think it's strange that Russia banned ONLY US citizens from adopting Russian children. Why didn't he just ban the adoption of children to the countless countries that have legalized gay marriage?
    </p>
    <p>
     <a href="http://www.ktk.kz/ru/news/video/2016/10/10/72822">
      Or how about the fact that Kazakhstan a close ally of Russian, also banned adoption of its children to USA.
     </a>
    </p>
    <p>
     Translated from what it says.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      The Kazakh government does not intend to lift the ban on adoptions by US citizens as long as the US government did not fulfill a number of conditions. The most important of them - to provide timely official Astana detailed information about each adopted child. Today, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic said that Washington is unable to provide it.
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Kazakhstan did not say they were banning adoption of children to US because of homophobic reasons. (Despite also having a homophobic culture). They clearly stated. They want information provided on every single Kazakh child adopted to USA. Their status and well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the video they talk about an 8 year old Kazakh girl and 13 year old boy who were regularly raped by their adopted parents. Another pair of adopted Kazakh boys were killed by their adopted father.
    </p>
    <p>
     Russia and Kazakhstan are in close ties with each other and share secrets. Let me just spill in another conspiracy.

      Russia and Kazakhstan have been buying and raising its gold reserves for the past 3-5 years
