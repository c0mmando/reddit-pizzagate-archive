<strong>(Warning: Conspiracy/Noise/venting post) Anybody seeing/hearing things differently since being red pilled?</strong>
<p><p>I've always loved this song by Smash Mouth, but I never understood what the hell they were singing about.  Now, when I hear it and read the lyrics, I can't help but being a little creeped out.  Its only more interesting that they were hugely adopted/endorsed by Disney.  Perhaps this song is only about <strong>shaming commercialism</strong>; but regardless, just trying to vent this</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM2z60kDdZo</p>
<p><strong>Walkin' on the Sun</strong>
It ain't no joke I'd like to buy the world a toke
And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
<strong>And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars</strong>
Hey I know it's just a song but it's <strong>spice for the recipe</strong>
This is a <strong>love attack I know it went out but it's back.</strong>
<strong>It's just like any fad it retracts before impact</strong>
<strong>And just like fashion it's a passion for the with it and hip</strong>
<strong>If you got the goods they'll come and buy it just to stay in the clique</strong></p>
<p>[Chorus:]
So don't delay act now <strong>supplies</strong> are running out
<strong>Allow if you're still alive six to eight years to arrive</strong>
And <strong>if you follow</strong> there may be a tomorrow
<strong>But if the offer's shunned you might as well be walkin' on the sun</strong></p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago <strong>they spoke out and they broke out</strong>
<strong>Of recession and oppression</strong> and together they toked
And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire
Just singin' and clappin' man what the hell happened
Then some were <strong>spellbound some were hellbound</strong>
Some they fell down and some got back up and
Fought back 'gainst the melt down
And <strong>their kids were hippie chicks all hypocrites</strong>
Because <strong>fashion is smashin' the true meaning of it</strong></p>
<p>[Repeat Chorus]</p>
<p>It ain't no joke when a mama's <strong>handkerchief</strong> is soaked
With her tears because <strong>her baby's life has been revoked</strong>
The <strong>bond is broke up</strong> so choke up and focus on the close up
<strong>Mr. Wizard can't perform no godlike hocus-pocus</strong>
So don't sit back kick back and watch the world get bushwhacked
<strong>News at 10:00 your neighborhood is under attack</strong>
Put away the crack <strong>before the crack puts you away</strong>
<strong>You need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate</strong></p>
<p>I realize this is sort of a shitpost and unsubstantiated; but just an example of how I am seeing/hearing things differently since coming here</p></p>

<p><p>I would tend to agree with you - but its hard to know for sure anymore, because there have been many occurrences that I figured were as simple as they seemed to be, but turned out to be much more.  If the lead singer of smash mouth got arrested tomorrow then this post would be totally relevant.  But yea, that was why I put a disclaimer on the title saying this was more venting than anything.</p></p>

<p><p>Someone else is researching music, perhaps you guys can focus on the writers of the songs? Maybe we can start tying some of these bands together through the people actually writing the message?</p></p>

<p><p>I have been onto this since last month. My family is about to commit me. It's like the movie "They Live."  Actually I may have to watch that again. Probably a warning to us all!</p></p>

<p><p>Maybe we are all meant to help everyone else when this hits. We are ready and have accepted the real reality. Everything that was bad is good. Everything good is bad. All you loved you now loathe. </p></p>
