        <p><p>Speaking of fake news....</p>
<p>The only thing MSM is focusing on is how we are claiming "hillary runs her sex ring in the backrooms of comet ping pong and hundreds of fake articles say things to this degree." Please if anyone can show me a single post from here or chan that actually pushed that idea as the main theme? I must have missed it. Also, wtf are they talking about news? This hasn't been picked up by any actual news sources until the NYT article. I haven't seen anyone link an article or info-graphics and claim it to be legitimate "news." It's bullshit, but at the same time I expected nothing less than this from MSM.</p></p>
