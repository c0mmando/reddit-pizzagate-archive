    What is the motive behind the child trafficking, pedophilia and rituals?
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Everybody I have told about pizzagate keeps asking me one question that I can't seem to answer, WHY? Why would the Clinton's and other high profile people get involved in something as horrible as this?

    If you don't investigate the occult aspects you'll never get the full picture.  You may or may not believe in in, but it's very obvious THEY believe in it.

     Great perspective. It's just really tough to get people to believe when the motive is hard to pin point. I guess we'll find out soon.

      Yeah you really can't use that to introduce this to people or you'll lose them. One of those things you connect sooner or later.

       That's my issue right now, what's the best way to introduce people to this without scaring them off thinking it's just another conspiracy theory.

        Try pointing out other things that have been proven that are hard to believe.

        Dahmer used to drill holes in his victims heads and fill them with acid to make living zombies. Cops had caught him with his victims before and let him go. Hard to rationalize his motives and understand how he didn't get caught sooner, but it doesn't mean it didn't happen.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are plenty of things even more fucked up than that. Hell, look at the holocaust or Unit 731. A lot of evil is in this world people don't realize. Ask them to keep an open mind since there is a chance children's lives ARE at stake, and if we don't take this seriously even more could be in danger.

        I know I would rather look like an idiot and be wrong than find out a ton of kids died because I was scared of looking like I was wearing a tin foil hat.

         In 2016, where technology is at our fingertips at every turn, to still laugh at people and call them "conspiracy theorists" is just so detrimental to them (the ones pointing and laughing). Like, is it REALLY soooooooo difficult to believe that maybe, just MAYBE all these people shouting about something happening MIGHT have some creedence to it? Like what, this whole sub is a bunch of people making up a big story because we are bored? Or could it be that there are concerned citizens who think pedophiles and child traffickers are horrible people that should be brought to light? Hmmmm........

        Find one of those sights like the D.C. Wordpress that is a basic intro of how we got to this point and link that.  I haven't seen a single person yet argue that we are deluding ourselves after looking into this.

     False. The reason is control. If you want into the inner circles, you have to compromise yourself in order to a part of the fraternity. It's like an initiation ritual. It's basically like "prove that this is more important to you than anything, any previous morals you might have had."
    </p>
    <p>
     This both gives the elites control over you because of what they could expose you for, and proves your commitment. Anyone who wants to make it to the big leagues with the true international power brokers, has to at least partake occasionally. And obviously some are more into it than others.

      I don't understand why an elite believing in the Christian god is pretty much expected but the idea that the same types are interested in the occult practices is somehow unbelievable.
     </p>
     <p>
      There would be no belief system more appealing to a sociopathic person than something like satanism that elevates ones ego to the level of god.
     </p>
     <p>
      I've been researching this for about 20 years, to say there's no occult aspect is laughable.

       I'm not saying there isn't some creepy occult shit going on too, definitely there is, but the practical side of it is to have that power of you. Once you do something like that, you are sort of all-in, and they can control you, which leads them to trust you, and the wheels keep spinning on their sick agenda.

        I'm with you man. There's definitely a huge blackmail element. Somebody posted the other day about a real life experience he had where 2 mothers tried to bait him into having sex with children. After you take the bait they own you.

     Think of all the millions of dollars in charitable donations to trafficking groups operating under the guise of legitimacy. How much do you think it would cost to bribe a police captain in some sub-Saharan wasteland to ignore the disappearance of a few people? (Or worse get them to assist.)
    </p>
    <p>
     Then they take these people and pimp them out constantly as a source of revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
     If they can be pimped out to wealthy, powerful people then they've just made an astronomical return on their investment. They've got all the cash from the numerous direct transactions. The real jackpot is the favor gained in social/political capital by threat of blackmailing powerful people for their heinous acts. You threaten a senator by exposing their affair with a staffer and it might get you a vote. If you threaten a senator by exposing their rape of a child you get whatever you want for life...

   <p>
    My take on it:
   </p>
   <p>
    Sex makes money. Sex with someone unwilling creates a sense of power and control. Children are weak and easy to take advantage of, especially immigrants and poor children. Unfortunately, there are people out there that (literally and figuratively) get off on this. Being able to pull the strings gives you the ability to blackmail and control these people into working for you, thus, giving you more power and money.
   </p>
   <p>
    Just my two cents.

     Also corruption/brainwashing of innocent children = more power but also sort of playing God because you are totally shaping another human's reality by taking advantage of them at such a young age

    Not sure about the rituals but here's my best guess:
   </p>
   <p>
    There's a secret society.  To gain entrance you'd have to make the newb do something abhorrent in order to make sure they don't leave and rat everyone out.  What's the best way?  Fuck a kid on top of a hanky, film it, take the hanky complete with DNA for safe-keeping.

    Money and Power.  They use the kids for satanic rituals, prostitution,  and blackmail.
   </p>
   <p>
    The rituals part of it answers a lot of questions.  There's an underground satanic movement that most people prefer to ignore.  Also they kill or blackmail anyone who threatens their power.
