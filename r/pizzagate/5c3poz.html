    I'm not 100% sure I buy David Shurter's story. Heard him on Ground Zero Radio the other day.

   <p>
    Is it really true or just something sensational to hold onto? When the pitch is 'buy my book' I have a hard time following after that.

     I have David Shurter as a Facebook friend, he seems to hold on to a lot of anger and it makes it hard to listen to him. And i agree, pitching to buy their book is a huge pet peeve of mine lol

      Thanks for that. I looked at his book on Amazon. Most of the reviews were overwhelmingly positive, but the negative reviews seemed to indicate that the book was an absolute mess.

      David claims his brother was a photographer for the pedophile ring and was killed or died. Any truth to that?
