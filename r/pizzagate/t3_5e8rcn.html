<p><p>I think they're getting scared. They had to come out with this because pizzagate is spreading across the internet, especially after our successful twitter campaign today. It was time to "correct the record".</p>
<p>Anyways, this article tries to dismiss all concerns one may have about pizzagate--by simply saying that the James Alefantis is scared by attacks on social media. It does not address:
-creepy insta posts
-coded Wikileaks emails
-the nearby businesses
-Tony Podesta's ""art"" collection
-the Clinton's and Podesta's friendships with convicted child molestors</p>
<p>And then they have the nerve to call US "fake news".</p>
<p>Fuck the New York Times. On the plus side though, this will get us way more exposure, and I'm sure some free thinkers who come across this article may do some research on their own and become redpilled.</p>
<p>Thanks MSM for telling me how to think! /sarcasm</p></p>

<p><p>Except most people don't know where to start, and the sidebar is unhelpful in that aspect.</p>
<p>The mods need to make a comprehensive updated summary with all the best and most relevant evidence, put in an easy-to-digest layout.</p>
<p>It's currently just a big wall of text with one link to a little bit of evidence. There's so much that could be added.</p></p>

<p><p>That will only serve to drive public outrage. Let them, in fact invite them to do this. Do they think we're suddenly going to stop talking about it because a subreddit disappears? We'll just disperse like a miasma to other areas of the internet while regrouping in other strongholds. </p></p>

<p><p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect</p>
<p>"The Streisand effect is the phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely, usually facilitated by the Internet. It is an example of psychological reactance, wherein once people are aware something is being kept from them, their motivation to access and spread the information is increased.[1]"</p></p>

<p><p>I like the description of us as a swarm of bees, although I think we are more like a bunch of angry hornets. Sting, sting, bite and sting again. They are not going to get us to leave them alone just by ineffectively swatting at us. There are way too many of us and we are pissed. </p>
<p>It was almost cute how they complained about the harassment they are getting. Maybe the powers that be should have given more thought to protecting children from pedophiles. People would not be swarming on this story like this if the authorities had actually been protecting children all these years. We have a lot of built up anger and frustration. </p>
<p>By reading through the comments on pizzagate reddit posts, anyone can tell that many of us have personal experiences with authorities who were in in it. I know I sure was. My anger over it will never go away either. Not until they are all locked up and every victim is safe.</p></p>

<p><p>Yes. You repeat an alleged attribute long enough, and people eventually accept it as valid.  I wonder if there's any psychological studies on this, </p>
<p>"Over time, studies have shown that repetition leads to familiarity, which is the key to fostering belief. In a 2007 paper published in the journal Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Doctor Norbert Schwarz, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, had this to say:</p>
<p>"Perceived familiarity exerts the observed influence because, under natural conditions, frequent exposure to an opinion is often a valid cue that many people share it, providing the social consensus information that figures prominently in Festinger's ''secondary reality tests." Moreover, daily conversational conduct is based on the assumption that communicated information is truthful and relevant (Grice, 1975), again fostering acceptance, in particular when it seems that one has ''heard this repeatedly.''"</p>

<p>They're going to pin that "fake news" attribute to the alternative media.  How do you counter?</p></p>

<p><p>I think it is the Clinton team strategy. They knew this news was out there, their ONLY defense is to call it all a lie, or in this case, "fake news." </p>
<p>It is what pedophiles always do when they get caught, viciously and vigorously attack their accusers. I know this for a fact because it happened to me when I exposed one. They will utterly destroy your reputation in a heartbeat in order to protect themselves from the accusation. It is a well oiled machine too. They have a lot of experience ruining people. </p></p>

<p>At first, I read this article and got pissed, but then I realized that they still don't get it. The media doesn't want to come to terms that the American public is either awake and aware of their bullshit and not listening, or just not listening because they don't care. </p>
<p>They're coming off an election cycle where they convinced (probably more than) half the country that Hillary was unbeatable, based on "empirical, infallible, SCIENTIFIC polls--" and turned out to be laughably wrong. Their trust is at an all time low, and their plan is to attribute it to "fake news?" </p>
<p>As the terrorist in Taken says, "Good luck."</p></p>

<p>Don't be naive. They know <em>exactly</em> what they're doing. We all know who distributed fake news throughout this election. The "normies" don't. The mainstream wants to remain the arbiter of truth so that they can continue to twist it.</p></p>

<p><p>Yes I get the agenda but the point is this "fake news" agenda is a signal of acknowledgment that they cannot control the narrative and that trust levels in the MSM have collapsed completely. The Fake News agenda is desperation - they know it is jarring and they are aware of the Streisand Effect and that they are maddening and radicalising people who know what hey are up to. But they are all out of ammo, and this strategy is an attempt to keep idiots on the plantation and to buy time for what hey have in mind (complete internet censorship and blame on the UN since Obama handed it over almost unnoticed).</p>
<p>It's a great sign and the fact they are forced into it will wake others up. Very few people like to be told what and how to think. </p></p>

<p><p>And this is why you are also hearing the president constantly talk about "fake news." They have a plan to take down or make it appear that sources that don't tell their narrative are false. Basically, anything they don't like will be called "fake" and they will start dismantling our network. </p></p>

<p>Notice how it wasn't an issue before the election???</p>
<p>It's for dealing with Pizzagate, now that the heir apparent has lost power.</p></p>

<p><p>Exactly. </p>
<p>We have been flooded with fake news from the NYT for years. They lied us into several wars. It is actually amusing that only now they start making claims of there being fake news out there when that is exactly what they do for a living. </p>
<p>One of my favorite videos ever is the one of 9/11 truther outside of the NYT building. I mean it is really funny to watch the reporters trying so hard to avoid a really huge story. They have their made-up version and they are sticking to it. </p></p>

<p><p>You know the NYT is in on all of this, right?  I think people are getting closer to accepting the fact that our world is fake.  Banks, corporations, media, politics, all are fronts for a criminal enterprise.  What we think and feel about our world has been spoon fed to us very carefully.  Think about your education growing up...Is the gap in knowledge between you and the powers that be so vast that you simply cannot understand them, or is it more likely you have simply never been taught things that those in power have been taught?  We've been intentionally kept in the dark for decades, probably longer, this article is just one more example of that.  So glad people are starting to recognize these patters.</p></p>

<p><p>Hahaha I hope those overpaid puppets see this. The best part is these idiots are playing it all wrong. By writing about it they're just giving it more attention. And when she lies about Alefantis not ever meeting Hillary and omits key details about David Brock it gives more information for people to discover. Good, send more traffic this way and let the people see the actual evidence and then see you've been lying NYT. People don't trust you in the first place and they definitely won't when they see this article is void of important info. </p></p>

<p><p>All the 9/11 truthers already know for a fact that the NYT is a lying piece of trash, this just confirms it. </p>
<p>I think the paper should be facing lawsuits. There are a lot of people with a lot of damages from the lies presented as truth by this rag. The people who work there should be held responsible for that. </p></p>

<p><p>It is like their team players are not even interested in discovering any truth. They want to be told what the story is that their team has agreed on, and then amplify it like a good little foot soldier. </p>
<p>I think it is a mindset that is taught in cultures where there is pedophilia to hide. It is like a group agreement to NEVER talk about it. Just do what you are told.</p></p>

<p><p>"He found dozens of made-up articles about Mrs. Clinton kidnapping, molesting and trafficking children in the restaurant’s back rooms. The articles appeared on Facebook and on websites such as The New Nationalist and The Vigilant Citizen, with one headline blaring: “Pizzagate: How 4Chan Uncovered the Sick World of Washington’s Occult Elite.” "</p>
<p>They literally just made shit up to try to tinfoil hat us. It's like if they tried to summarize 9/11 conspiracy theorists by saying "They believe that george bush piloted both planes that hit the trade center, and that he bent the steel beams with superhuman strength because 'Jetfuel doesn't melt steel beams, but George Bush does.' Sources report that everyone who believes this unanimously also believes that our world is ruled and populated by shapeshifting reptiles."</p></p>

<p><p>I'd LOVE to know where these 'dozens of made up articles' are. I don't think I have seen one person claim that Clinton herself is raping kids in the restaurant's back rooms.</p>
<p>You nailed it. They are making shit up just to tin-foil us. I love how they keep reiterating how they are from 'fake news articles' linking to their own articles about how to avoid fakes. Bitch, please, have you ever read your own website? At the very least, link to the information so people can make up their own minds instead of spitting out what you want them to believe and only supplying links to your own god damn site. They don't even link to the 4Chan article!!</p>
<p>/rant I'm so sick of this.</p>

<p>no, its like saying "they believe that innocent arabs who were under mk ultra mind control led an attack on the usa which the cia and mossad knew about in advance which is why they secretly planted explosives in the building to help because they knew the plane impact wouldnt cause enough damage to the building and why they didnt scramble aircraft quickly and then they also flew a missile into the pentagon but littered some aircraft debris around to make you think it was a plane impact and also israel or something"</p>

<p><p>Shouldn't of said "proof", but Alefantis cooked for a Hillary fundraiser at the podesta home, received a hand signed letter from Hillary, and was dating david brock, a long time Clinton confidant. Also he was listed as the 49th most powerful person in Washington. So to conclude he would have never met her in that time would be highly, highly unlikely.</p></p>

<p><p>I thought that was a little weird too, but I don't remember seeing any pictures of Hillary at Comet. Just Obama. IS there any proof that they've met, at all?</p></p>

<p><p>Shouldn't of said "proof", but Alefantis cooked for a Hillary fundraiser at the podesta home, received a hand signed letter from Hillary, and was dating David Brock, long time clinton aide and head of CTR. Also he was listed as the 49th most powerful person in Washington. So to conclude he would have never met her in that time would be highly, highly unlikely. </p></p>

<p><p>Eh. He honestly may not have. None of that would necessitate Hillary's presence, that's what Podesta is for. These fundraisers probably took place all over the country, she couldn't be at all of them.</p></p>

I can't even show my friends this place as much as I appreciate the more substantial evidence being uncovered (secret logins, portals with possibly massive files on a pizza website, weird reactions from pizza shops under scrutiny).</p>

<p>Try again. I'm really not trying hard at all. Nobody here is trying hard enough. It doesn't take much thinking or scrutiny to see why a lot of what people have taken as the gospel truth or "evidence" are not as definitive as so desperately want to believe.</p></p>

<p><p>When I saw WITH MY OWN EYES the boyfriend of my brother in law fondling my six year old son's junk, I told everybody about it. All of a sudden it became a big deal for me to have to provide "proof." Now, if I had had my wits about me when it happened, I could have maybe snapped a picture and maybe produce "proof," but I didn't. </p>
<p>What did amaze me was that my word on it was suddenly not good enough. "Proof" was DEMANDED and if I didn't have proof, it was proof that I was the liar. It ruined a lot of relationships I had with a lot of people. </p>
<p>In retrospect I'm glad I didn't have proof. If I did, I would've pursued it and I don't know who this guy was. I only know his first name. But what I do know is he came from a very rich and powerful family of southern lawyers. If I had had proof, I might have been killed. He destroyed my reputation with the rest of my in laws. It was really terrible what he did to me. I'm just glad I kept him away from my son, he was grooming him for sex and the rest of the family refused to even consider it as a threat. </p>
<p>What is wrong with those people? Were they molested as children and thought it was normal? I sure couldn't figure out why they would want to harbor a pedophile and insist that my son and I accept him with open arms. Yikes! </p></p>

<p><p>I empathize with you sister. I tried to protect my little boy from his father, with photos of injury and hospital reports, dozens of professional reports, and ONE cps worker who denied the abuse occurred. They forced my child into the sole custody of his abuser and put a protection order against me. Unfortunately, I know thousands similarly situated. In fact, even pedophiles with multiple victims/convictions have unfettered access to victims despite long drawn out years in court due to CPS being inept/funding driven, and misogynistic representation by DA of CPS/PD. As you said, it's nearly impossible to protect children in US. It's quite simple to protect pedophiles. Most BAR members are complicit, including judges. Boston Globe wrote an article 1/31/15 I think my mom believed me' which shows how tragically failing the system is. Perhaps BG would be willing to take a shot at #pizzagate. They did produce spotlight under intense scrutiny. 
They may be our only hope. </p></p>

</p>
<p><p>This sort of reporting disgusts me. I'm starting to get really pissed off so I sent them a message. </p>
<p>"Hello,</p>
<p>I'm becoming very concerned at your level of journalistic quality. For some reason this article is called a fact check, but you do not highlight any of the independent research done by citizens who have began to to your job. This is no conspiracy, the only conspiracy here is the media conspiring to brainwash every day people into not questioning the information they hear, and then when nobody questions anything anymore, determine the issue to be with the sources instead, meaning people must be helped along with the truth and have entities like you deciphering fact from fiction for us... when in reality, you create the fiction.</p>
<p>So you are aware, James Alefantis had some extremely creepy photos on his instagram. His family restaurant with ping pong had paedohpillic art on the walls - by an artist who is depicting her own child rape in that art. There is a picture of a little girl in the restaurant taped to the table, which could be in jest - normal people do not jest this way, why is there masking tape in the dining area? This alone can be disregarded, but the mountains of creepy photos on his instagram which has all been archived should be considered. James Alefantis is David Brock's ex boyfriend, and director of correct the record - this may not mean much to you, however. Recently paid up, was it $800,000 in a blackmail case... I wonder what they were blackmailing him for that made him pay up? Keep in mind, Arun Rao, attorney charged with prosecuting child pornography and abuse liked the worst of these photos on Alefantis' page on instagram. That is interesting.</p>
<p>Next door is Besta Pizza.. now you haven't covered anything about this, and I'd like to know why? Besta has a FBI unclassified document CONFIRMED paedophile symbol as it's logo (which has since been changed). The owner of this restaurant is Andrew Kline, one of four attorneys appointed by Ms Clinton herself to deal with child trafficking. So now please explain how Kline would not be fully aware of the paedophillic symbolism he is using in his logo. </p>
<p>We have the fact Podesta had pedophilic art of half dressed children around his home. This is no smoking gun, but if I discovered any of my close life long friends to be child rapists, like Clement Freud, or Dennis Hastert, or Epstein (disproportionate to the percentage of pedophiles in population, an anomoly), I would IMMEDIATELY cut these people from my life. The Poestas however choose to remain in close contact with these people. Strange decision indeed.</p>
<p>1 of Podesta's emails was an invite by Granma Luzzotto to Lorettaville farm where she lists her step-grandchildren, with ages included (to these people joining her at a private personal party), before refering to them as 'entertainment' for the night. Now This grandmother has a babysitting website... a comment about one of her younger babies is, " and you can spend time with her alone and uncut for a limited time only". Make of it what you will.</p>
<p>If you continue to spread this disinformation and squash the revelation of paedophiles on all levels of government you are an accomplice to these crimes and will be held accountable. Do not think because most people are brainwashed by the media (including people receiving this email, you are most likely screwing your face at me for being a 'conspiracy theorist' right now). This is not about you, this is not left, this is not right, this is not about me. This is about our little babies, and about our liberty. You simply cannot disregard this crowd sourced investigation as if serious, questionable information has not been found, because it has.</p>
<p>If you are going to debunk this research, you best have facts and counter arguments to come up with. This article I reference above is nothing but buzzwords and manipulation. Make people feel bad for investigating a possible international wide paedophile ring... these investigatiors are doing something that is a natural insinct to most... protecting the children.</p>
<p>By the way, I am fully aware that this paedophile ring exists. As your article mentions, people no longer seem to possess the power of independent research - well done for your contributions to the dumbing down of society and a step towards democide. Unfortunately, there are people who are still awake, and refuse to believe we have slipped into Aldous Huxley's 'Brave new world'. It's true.... we are not (yet) restricted from the truth, it is just swimming in a sea of falsehoods perpetuated by the likes of the mainstream media.</p>
<p>How about you do some REAL investigative journalism. This is disgusting coverage and belittlement of people who are trying to save YOUR children, OUR children. If you remain complicit and do not look into these things I have mentioned....whoever is reading this, I hope you realise what you are perpetuating. </p>
<p>I hope this gets lost in your emails and becomes another example of the truth amongst the lies. I sincerely hope you realise what you are doing to society and how damaging this is to both culture and 95% of people. </p>
<p>Please change.</p>
<p>Sincerely,
An appalled citizen from across the pond."</p></p>

<p><p>Great summary. One correction: the artwork on the wall at Comet is from a guy called Arrington De Dionyso—not related to Kim Noble. </p></p>

<p><p>I found this and was about to post it before I found it here; this shit made my blood boil. </p>
<p>First, I was like what shitty, irresponsible journalism. Then I made the logical next leap that the NYT doesn't do fact-checks -- they do hit pieces and cover jobs, this being the latter. The masses are to believe it's just all "fake news," because they say it is. These innocent shop owners, who are loosely connected to, eh, just the strongest, most elite members of government are being harassed! How awful! </p>

<p><p>It disgusts me beyond words how the very media sources who have come up with the most one-sided propaganda and BS, are the very same ones who shill and lie for the Elites. No coincidence it's the Carlos Slim Blog who backed Hillary to insane levels and destroyed their market brand.</p>
<p>This "fake news" agenda they are pushing now is simply censorship dressed up as concern for the poor misguided public. It's so Orwellian. Same goes with this "fact checking" BS and especially the fact checker websites. They are simply one sided opinions, skewed and carefully written to present one side as 'the truth' and the other as 'misinformation'.  Same goes with Obamas "truthiness" test.</p>
<p>It's symptomatic of the public waking up, discarding the dinosaur media which has become increasingly biased towards a globalist agenda (currently Liberal but really the Establishment of left-right everywhere is Globalist faux-democracy). As people rejected it, new discourse took place on social media and the alternative media blossomed. </p>
<p>The Elites lost the argument with Brexit and now with Trump. Despite the combined might of academia-media-pop culture - their plans were thwarted by populism (which is only right wing in he sense that those parties have taken advantage; elsewhere there is populist Leftist movements which are alien to the NeoLiberal agenda).</p>
<p>So his truthiness / fake news / social media censorship / MSM demonisation / fact checker / CTR AstroTurf trolls agenda is a desperate attempt to quell open debate and steer us all back "onto the plantation" of the Leftist Globalist New World Order. </p>
<p>Who would doubt this now - given the extreme reaction to Pizzagate? It's CLEAR we are onto some thing when we have had a very strong backlash.</p>
<p>KEEP FIGHTING! This is not Left-right. This is Good-Evil. It just so happens the evil Elites have co-opted Leftism because it's adherents are more prone to brainwashing, dogmatic thinking, and unquestioning acceptance of authority figures (be they pundits, historic newspapers, academics, politicians, pop stars).</p></p>

<p><p>It is clear the 'fake news' is the result of a post-election think-tank. Let this be a lesson to everyone, research, use the information gained wisely and with critical analysis, and stay away from threats and the like that will cause the law to investigate us instead of what we find. We have to be smart about this. </p></p>

<p><p>The backlash is already up, though... not a single Twitter person saying, "nice article" or "good read." All backlash with posting pictures. </p>
<p>I used to think the most of the media was smart and the most of the public was stupid. I've now turned a 180 in that perception.</p>

<p><p>They literally did not address ANYTHING. Also, there are not "dozens of articles" saying Hillary is directly involved. What utter nonsense.</p>
<p>I have to say, my editor and I were pretty amused/excited for the New York Times to finally bestow us the title of "fake news" LOL</p>
<p>For the record, THIS ARTICLE is all we've done about it. I totally erred on the side of caution. Now I'm only more determined to keep giving this <em>conspiracy theory</em> a fair media hearing.</p>

<p><p>I gave that bullshit 3 paragraphs. So they did mention HB...</p>
<p>Isn't it telling how long the article is? </p>
<p>You know when you accuse someone of something and then they just ramble on and on about how they're innocent? They think if they keep on talking they can convince you. The article reminded me of that behavior. So, no, I didn't read it all, but it's amazing they mentioned HB. I think it's just too easy at this point. The perpetrators are truly too dumb <em>or</em> they think the general population is too dumb to figure it out. I think the truth is both. They're too stupid to cover it all up, but the majority is too mindless to read into anything. Most people read headlines and move on today.</p></p>

<p><p>I advice people to simply ignore NYT and not give them any clicks or views. This election proved that their "journalists" are nothing more than lobbyists and PR-workers for Hillary Clinton and her circle of deviant pedophiles and criminals. You don't have to read a word NYT publishes about "Pizzagate" to know that facts and truth about the horrible crimes committed against children will NOT be included. </p>
<p>NYT said goodbye to real journalism a long time ago, and now their readers and subscribers are saying goodbye to them. Just go bankrupt and disappear, NYT, it is well deserved. You are vermin protecting the scum of the Earth.  </p></p>

<p><p>They are getting scared.  And didn't address any of the evidence one bit.  Bias corrupted New York Times is just working her those that are trying to keep this story silenced.  It's funny how they cling on to this narrative of fake news yet employ it's very tactics.  It looks quite unprofessional and unsophisticated to those with journalistic ears.    We all understand something extremely shady is going on there.  Questions need be demanded and answered. </p></p>

<p><p><a href="http://www.newnationalist.net/2016/11/11/belgiums-dutroux-pedophile-child-rape-affair-a-road-map-for-deep-state-criminality/">Cover-up techniques</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dummy up. If it’s not reported, if it’s not news, it didn’t happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wax indignant. This is also known as the “how dare you” gambit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Characterize the charges as “rumors” or, better yet, “wild rumors.” If, in spite of the news blackout, the public is still able to learn about the suspicious facts, it can only be through “rumors.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>4. Knock down straw men. Deal only with the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Even better, create your own straw men. Make up wild rumors and give them lead play when you appear to debunk all the charges, real and fanciful alike.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Call the skeptics names like “conspiracy theorist,” “nut,” “ranter,” “kook,” “crackpot” and, of course, “rumor monger.” You must then carefully avoid fair and open debate with any of the people you have thus maligned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impugn motives. Attempt to marginalize the critics by suggesting strongly that they are not really interested in the truth but are simply pursuing a partisan political agenda or are out to make money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invoke authority. Here the controlled press and the sham opposition can be very useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dismiss the charges as “old news.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Come half-clean. This is also known as “confession and avoidance” or “taking the limited hang-out route.” This way, you create the impression of candor and honesty while you admit only to relatively harmless, less-than-criminal “mistakes.” This stratagem often requires the embrace of a fall-back position quite different from the one originally taken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Characterize the crimes as impossibly complex and the truth as ultimately unknowable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reason backward, using the deductive method with a vengeance. With thoroughly rigorous deduction, troublesome evidence is irrelevant. For example: We have a completely free press. If they know of evidence that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) had prior knowledge of the Oklahoma City bombing they would have reported it. They haven’t reported it, so there was no prior knowledge by the BATF. Another variation on this theme involves the likelihood of a conspiracy leaker and a press that would report it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require the skeptics to solve the crime completely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the subject. This technique includes creating and/or reporting a distraction.</p>
</li>
</ol></p>

<p><p>Days before the presidential election, James Alefantis, whose name happens to mean 'I love Children' in French, owner of a local pizza restaurant called Comet Ping Pong, noticed an unusual spike in the number of his Instagram followers.</p>
<p>There, fixed the opening paragraph. </p></p>

<p><p>For the record, "James Alefantis" does not mean "I love children" in any language, let alone in French. 
We need to stop parroting these "factoids" and focus on the legit stuff.</p></p>

<p><p>The phrase would be "J'aime les enfants" in French, so you can't say it's a match.</p></p>

<p><p>French news site "Rue89" has translated most of the article and it's almost the only french speaking source you can find so far about the pizzagate</p>
<p>http://rue89.nouvelobs.com/2016/11/22/fake-news-cauchemar-dune-pizzeria-washington-265716</p>
<p>the only other source I found in french is from "Egalité &amp; Réconcilition" wich has a very bad reputation in France because of it's owner, the notorious Alain Soral (very know in France for speaking a lot about conspiracies and hating on the jewish people) </p>
<p>http://www.egaliteetreconciliation.fr/Pizzagate-les-internautes-ont-ils-decouvert-un-reseau-pedocriminel-d-elite-impliquant-le-clan-42647.html</p>
<p>But actually, his article is the only one stating a lot of things instead of just saying "it's all fake !"</p></p>
