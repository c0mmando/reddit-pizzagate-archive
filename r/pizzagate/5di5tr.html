    Was looking for some info on Helena Blavatsky and happened to watch this documentary:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL4vG9NFQBs
   </p>
   <p>
    This covers the proto-Nazi Thule Society and their rumored use of child sacrifice. While occult practices and seances weren't unheard of in America in the early 20th century I haven't found accounts of ritual sacrifice or cannibalism among Alistair Crowley's following. Everything has been debunked and I believe that Crowley was basically the KISS/Howard Stern of his time: https://ac2012.com/2011/12/20/aleister-crowley-myths-busted/
   </p>
   <p>
    After looking at all of the other horrors of the Nazi Regime would be more inclined to believe that they were in fact sacrificing children. A lot of orphans after WWI.
   </p>
   <p>
    So, how would child-sacrificing occultists make their way into the CIA? The rush for Nazi rocket scientists was one factor. Probably through various channels as well but there is one connection that stands out.

    Here comes that Bush family again. Not going to tie this into Skull and Bones society as I don't have any links other than GW Bush himself being a member. Like the Georgetown connection between Podesta and Clinton these groups could be recruiting fronts for the NWO/CIA pedos.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now this is speculation but the potential use of kids as sex workers could also be used to generate blackmail over world leaders and power players. We know about the UK pedo ring, and Jeffrey Epstein had video cameras installed to get black mail material on his "guests".
   </p>
   <p>
    Thought I'd throw these dots out there and see if adds up with the broader picture and trying to figure out the origins of this mess. Kind of makes sense to me considering the MKUltra connection.

    Yes, this is the most likely scenario. Ritual abuse victims often

    , and report

    .  Nazi ideology is also a
