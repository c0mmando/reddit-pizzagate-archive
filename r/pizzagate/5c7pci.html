    The "heavy breathing" one has a line in it, "what are you, a pedophile?"

    The video with the weird voice celebrating a 'lord' has been debunked. If you watch the whole video instead of some doctored clips you'll realize it's somebody celebrating their own birthday and they're making a joke calling them self a 'lord'. As creepy as it all is, there are some odd characters out there.

     Did you watch it?  The Announcer with the creepy voice is celebrating the birthday of Sasha Lord, a young woman affiliated with Comet Pizza. The announcers creepy story about euthanasia of a newborn baby was really appalling.

     I was actually more concerned about the rest of those videos in the upload history. Not sure what to think about them. Some pretty weird stuff there.

       Latest upload is titled "Secret Pizza Party" and it appears to be a reading of some sort of children's book. Others are "reviews" of Comet Ping Pong, Politics and Prose and an apparent music video for the band Heavy Breathing, all of these names are in the "Friends" section of the Comet Ping Pong website as well. Two others are of a "puppet" who have been addressed on 4chan

        Shit like this is why I believe this is absolutely real.  What the fuck is with all the pizza references everywhere?  Why are those who defend these people as normal and harmless not explaining all this fucking bizarre evidence we keep finding?
