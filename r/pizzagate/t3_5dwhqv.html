        <strong>Former FBI agent Sibel Edmonds says government PURPOSEFULLY appoints the most criminal people to leadership positions for blackmail</strong>
        <p><p>For those that do not know her she was an FBI whistle-blower in the aftermath of 911.  She was a translator who had heard some criminality taking place b/w US officials and Foreign officials.  She was gagged for many years and went to court and testified. Regarding PizzaGate. She says the gov performs deep background checks and appoints the most criminal prospect so they can use what they found to control them later on. Discussed in the first 9 min of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XMoejT3lKs&amp;t=9s</p></p>

        <p><p>This is really the most plausible explanation. To say all major political powers are pedophiles is a bit ridiculous. To say that there is an established system of power engaging in this that uses it to implicate and control incoming political powers makes much more sense.</p></p>

        <p><p>It is what we are observing. I mean, what she says matches with what we can see. It is a network of really evil people and we can see that fact very clearly if we judge them by what they do; and more or less ignore what they (and their presstitute echo chamber) tell us. All that stuff is just a bunch of brainwashing. </p>
<p>It is kind of funny that these people staged 9/11 in order to seize power and yet that act set people like Sibel in motion as planetary watchdogs against them. The 9/11 truthers, anti-spyers, whistle-blowers, etc, figured out and demonstrated that our government was fully corrupt, it is getting publicly exposed. Karma, hubris? They asked for it. Their nest of vipers is coming out of the darkness, the sunlight is creeping in on them. </p>
<p>I assume political figures are not pedophiles until I see some evidence that makes me think that they are. That is a good fail safe position to take, same for the movie star types. I assume they are not until there is evidence that incriminates them. I think that is pretty much the standard for most people, I hope it would be. </p></p>

        <p><p>That is one of things with pedophilia. It is literally the most damning politically thing you could do outside of treason. Talk about having something on someone imagine if a video of some senator was released having sex with a 7 year old. The outrage would be fucking out of this world.</p></p>

        <p><p>Absolutely.  Scary.  Hearing her explain why/how this happens had a chilling effect on me b/c you automatically ask yourself "What percentage of officials are where they are b/c of their skeletons and not b/c they were the most qualified for the job?"   It definetely explains why our government was caught spying on everyone - even our so called allies (Thanks Snowden).  They were looking for any dirt that they could use as blackmail on an international level. </p></p>

        <p><p>while that's probably true too, I think that function is provided mainly by the institutions that purportedly help children in need like Child Protective Services, in tandem with the institutions set up to combat human trafficking.  They may indeed help <em>some</em> children, but it's all a vetting process to find the easiest targets and to cover up any messes by conducting fake investigations. </p>

        <p><p>I think her videos would be vastly improved if she dropped her "ads." Every time I see her, she follows any real news I might want to hear with a big harangue about her audience, other people, etc. It is really nasty, IMO and it seriously detracts from her popularity. It is like bragging about being irritating in the most irritating way possible. She can really use a little bit of advice my mother told me, "if you can't say anything nice about people, don't say anything at all." </p>
<p>Speaking as her POTENTIAL audience, I don't want to be told we don't give a damn, or whatever burr she has under her saddle that day. If she just dropped the vitriol, editing works, then I think she might become a LOT more popular. </p>
<p>In other words, I'm NEVER going to send any money to anyone who is so verbally abusive. Not in a million years. I don't even want to listen to it. I think she comes off as a VERY unpleasant person and that is too bad because it is true she has good information, but I sure don't want to dig through her abusive videos to try to find it. No way. She is just not that special. </p></p>

<p>From this interview I decided to read her book, <em>Classified Woman.</em> It's absolutely mind-blowing, and I think if you picked it up you'd be on your knees thanking whatever deity exists that people like her still exist. </p>
<p>It's incredible what she went through during her time in the FBI to "do the right thing." She did this all in the face of a nebulous shadow government filled with their criminals working in our own govt. </p></p>

        <p><p>TL;DR: We are a country run by criminals... which is all by design. Great video.</p></p>
