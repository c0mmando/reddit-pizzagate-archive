        <p><p>That... wow...</p>
<p>Anyone else getting the inkling that Mr. Culkin is talking about it without talking about it? When you think about it... isn't home alone a soft core pedo-fantasy series? They never actually get the kid, but they wouldn't be able to show it anyway.</p>
<p>But Culkin, the Coreys, the Disney Kids... yeah...</p></p>

        <p><p>You say that, but honestly, if this is as big and old as the stories, then it's likely that MJ was involved as a child too. Mike always gave me the vibe that he was a victim and not a pedo. He was just peculiar and hermetic, so it's easy for people to assume.</p>
<p>I mean think about it, a grown man whose house is basically a theme park. I remember him saying that he was basically stuck as a child in his head. Hmm. I wonder what could cause that kind of dissociation? MKULTRA ... sexual abuse? I dunno ... He surrounded himself with kids. Maybe even kids that he knew had gone through the same or similar things as him, hence the Macaulay connection in this post. He was tragic, yes. Horrible, I don't think so.</p></p>

        <p><p>I wasn't saying Mike was a ringleader or even a serious player. </p>
<p>Mike was most certainly abused as a kid, physically that we know of for sure.  Joe Jackson, his father was notorious for punishing the whole family if they put on a poor performance.  Most, if not all have spoken about it publicly. </p>
<p>Was he sexually abused? Subjected to mind controlling torture tactics like have been suggested here? Perhaps. </p>
<p>I think with Mike he was just kind of fucked up from his childhood.  He started making music, people loved him, he became the King of Pop and <em>then</em> he was brought into the fold.  Maybe he was noticed earlier on as a potential vehicle to deliver a message and once he gained fucking intergalactic superstardom he was approached.  It was always weird to me how the content of his music changed from very light hearted and enjoyable topics to racially motivated, politically charged content. </p>
<p>Maybe his content matured as he did.  But he completely switched formulas from what made him so popular. </p>
<p>Maybe whoever is in charge of recruiting is able to spot weaknesses in people that make them more attractive to them because I don't think Mike was born into it given his race and his upbringing in Gary Indiana.  Just doesn't fit. </p></p>

        <p><p>All of this has gotten me thinking about a lot of deaths.  </p>
<p>MJ and Prince for the reasons you mentioned.  Stanley Kubrick dies weeks after Eyes Wide Shut is released.  Heart attack with no history of heart or health problems.  Just up and dies after releasing a movie that is eerily similar to what we're looking at here. </p>
<p>Justice Scalia. Dies suddenly on vacation.  Pronounced dead by the justice of the peace without even seeing the body.  No autopsy ordered because the bumfuck West Texasaw enforcement officer that found him said there was no foul play.  The last remaining constitutional conservative on a Supreme Court already filled with liberals just dies? Right before SHE was supposed to win their election? </p></p>

        <p><p>The thing with the occult is that it has to be demonstrated in public (they don't actually lie exactly). It's about deception. It's similar to having to invite the vampire IN. They only get their kick if they've annouced it, no matter how cryptically it's done. These occultists ALWAYS give warning etc, but it's coded. It's part of their fun.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is a little off topic, but I just watched a new release on Netflix called The Late Bloomer.  Its about a guy who's like 30 and is just finally starting to go through puberty.  There's a lot of creepy per-pubescent sex "jokes" throughout the movie, but something else caught my eye.  </p>
<p>In the very beginning of the movie during what you would call the opening credits, it flashes different things on the screen, including pizza and hot dogs (remember the Podesta emails referencing hot dogs as well as pizza?) </p>
<p>I think this shit really is completely entrenched in Hollywood</p></p>

        <p><p>What in the actual fuck. I would've gotten the feeling that he'd been abused as a kid if I saw this video even before coming into this sub and the others dealing with this pedo ring. Now I can't unsee it. </p></p>
