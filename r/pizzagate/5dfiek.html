    Peep these excerpts from a profile of David Leiter and Tamera Luzzatto in N (Nantucket) Magazine, 2014. Tam Luzzatto emailed this to John Podesta, which you can see here:
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/40966
   </p>
   <p>
    The feature compares them to Frank and Claire Underwood from "House of Cards":

   </p>
   <p>
    David Leiter and Tam Luzzatto first met at "private" Camp David getaway for close Clinton associates in 2000:

   </p>
   <p>
    Tamera Luzzatto started out working for Sen. Jay Rockefeller:

   </p>
   <p>
    Tony Podesta replied that he "loved the photos" in the magazine feature: 
http://imgur.com/a/p5vd1
   </p>
   <p>
    Here's my favorite:

   </p>
   <p>
    David Leiter on the bad reputation of Washington lobbyists: "It's like any other profession; there are those with whom you would trust with your children and there are those who you would not want your children to meet." (!!!)
http://imgur.com/a/rA6ZP
   </p>
   <p>
    For those who need a reminder, someone found this creepy fucking website featuring "Gran Tam" and her granddaughters called Evie's Crib..."Something sick going on here":
http://imgur.com/a/FB4ur
   </p>
   <p>
    The top of the site reads: 
"Evelyn is growing up, soon she will be the Queen of the entire US of A, right now, for a limited time only, you can spend some time with her online, raw and uncut. Take advantage of this now, as in the future she will have the power of life and death over you."
   </p>
   <p>
    WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN?
   </p>
   <p>
    Someone on 4chan identified Gran Tam's 3 granddaughters as also popping up on the website of a sketchy "infant massage therapist" based in Easthampton, NY (playground of the .01%): 
http://imgur.com/a/Z5994
http://imgur.com/a/8x6i4
   </p>
   <p>
    Oh look, a picture of Bill Clinton on his website:
http://imgur.com/a/KVx4k
   </p>
   <p>
    David Leiter's nickname is "Vudu" - given to him by "his Portuguese grandparents" - here he is playing with the same kids from the "Something sick going on here" website...his grandkids:

   <p>
    Tamera posts pic of granddaughter, commenter says "enjoy the bananas wrapped in ham and topped with cheese sauce!" um?:
http://imgur.com/a/okwDd
   </p>
   <p>
    One more thing that I noticed in the chain of "Farmers L party" emails...
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=%22farmers+L+update%22&amp;mfrom=&amp;mto=&amp;title=&amp;notitle=&amp;date_from=&amp;date_to=&amp;nofrom=&amp;noto=&amp;count=50&amp;sort=6#searchresult
   </p>
   <p>
    one of the guests, Drew Littman, makes this joke:
"Thanks for remembering me, as I was planning to use the farm as the backdrop to announce my candidacy for Speaker of the House."
   </p>
   <p>
    One of the responses is: "Might as well. I'll live blog it"
   </p>
   <p>
    http://imgur.com/a/FcfWK
   </p>
   <p>
    Lots of inside-baseball jokes in this email chain, but I checked and Drew Littman is a powerful tech lobbyist and currently senior counsel in the Dept of Health and Human Services. In other words, he's not a Congressman and thus would never be running for Speaker of the House, which means this is some kind of joke.
   </p>
   <p>
    One possibility: this party was in October 2015, not long after Former Speaker of the House (and longtime friend of Tony Podesta) Denny Hastert finally got nailed for raping underage boys. Could he be making a sick joke about becoming Speaker of the House because they're about to go full Denny Hastert on Tam's poor granddaughters?
   </p>
   <p>
    There's more information on them floating around between 4/8chan and r/pizzagate, but TAMERA LUZZATTO and DAVID LEITER need to be researched as aggressively as James Alefantis. These two are a high-ranking power couple, and Tamera was directly responsible for managing Hillary's schedule for 8 years - the same period of time that Bill was flying around with Jeffrey Epstein to pedo island.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her farm parties in Lovettsville, VA sound as sketchy as Tony P's underground video art vault. She
    <em>
     appears
    </em>
    to be trafficking her own grandchildren to rich and influential people. What other explanation is there for the Evie's Crib website? Who the fuck needs to spend some "Raw and uncut" time with a newborn baby?

     Can someone cross reference these "infant massage" parlors with the massage parlors that were circled in Epstein's book? Is there any way to make a connection here?

        You did NOT talk to Bill Murray the actor. I just called &amp; spoke to this guy and he was very nice to me, but extremely confused as to why people were calling him. I told him that I'd let you guys know this is NOT Bill Murray the actor &amp; to stop calling him and he said he appreciated that. Also, these area codes are for Virginia which has nothing to do with Bill Murray the actor.

        Just posted this in another thread, but it's the same contacts lists so relevant:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Don't know where this applies, but in Sid Blumenthal's contact list that was leaked, cometpingpong@gmail.com was auto-added to his contacts - like all email software does to frequently-emailed addresses that aren't found in contacts.

          I've watched them all.  They contain satan worshipping, incest, nudity, a horse's ass, a drugged out girl being sexually assaulted while blood pours out of her mouth.  It is absolutely disgusting.  I havent even watched the zombie video yet

        The "demon egg sacks" thing is an ascii rendition of the line art of a famous 1850's naturalist, I've seen that art on Wikipedia before along with other similar scans of his works. He did a lot of depictions of sea creatures and shells. I'm on mobile or I'd offer a link with a name, but I don't know offhand.
       </p>
       <p>
        At least, I think. I'd be amazed if I'm wrong.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why someone would make this, or host it on this strange page, or anything else to do with it, I don't know.

        Somebody should just send a mass email to everyone on that list letting them know what is being looked into.  If they were innocent they'd call the fbi.  If guilty, they might not.  If they do then you will opened up a dialogue with the fbi.

          I'm confused.  How is Bill Murray tied into this and how did you talk to him?  I guess I'm a little behind.

             Yes he did. Bill Murray in Virginia who is completely unrelated. I called as well &amp; the poor guy was so confused as to why people are calling him and I told him I'd come tell everyone to stop because it is NOT Bill Murray the actor.

       I'm not clicking this shit. Shills on 4chan posted a similar link that attempted to run a script in the background.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: your history points to you not being a shill, so not accusing you of anything, just letting you know that others were doing this.

        This guy claims the website was around before 4chan and the video is creepy. I don't know what running a script is or anything, but this was apparently pre-4chan.

         Gotcha. Just so you know, people were   linking to .html sites that run scripts in the background that do god knows what. A script is essentially just a program. Can be harmless, but I wouldn't trust any of them on sites that were visiting here.
        </p>
        <p>
         You should be using Firefox if you're not. It should alert you if a script tries to run.

          Please relay this to 4chan for extra digging, if you're on that forum. This has been discussed in the past, according to google, and has led to nothing, however, I believe there is relevant info to be gained from this. I don't know where it is or how to get it, but I know it's there. This is not a 9 year old troll site with 100's and 100's of pages and links for nothing, involving murder/sex/blood/etc. This has to be relevant.

           To tired to further google this, but if you talk about the weird video on the google post it is really very old, a well known "internet mystery" and most likely linked to a school project somewhere in eastern europe. I forgot what the evidence was tho.

          If Firefox would do that you would have notifications all the time :) Ether you use NoScript or you talk about WebWorkers which is something different. None of the browsers will warn you about scripts beeing run, also there are only very few things Javascript (the language used) can do on your computer, none of which are really scary. Assuming you dont use flash or Javawebstart because that shit is scary.

            I dont think so actually. I havent used firefox in a while, so maybe it has some kind of warning for some things by now. But as far as i know browsers only notify you about specific things like: Writing to the harddrive, Using microphone or webcam, installing a background worker, ...

        Luzzatto@aol.com was searched on google. 4th page this shows up. LHOHQ.info seems to be a 9 year old, elaborate troll to the max, or sometimes very strange and very dark that is relevant to this investigation. Neither have been proven, but I'm leaning toward the latter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Get this to anyone that knows what they're doing. There are 100's and 100's of pages with links and massive walls of text.
       </p>
       <p>
        Luzzatto has a few hits on google relating to various rabbi's, etc. I'm wondering if gematria could play a role in the schizo-text?

        Almost all of the pictures are links. There are 100's of pages. There is text on almost all of them. Text ranges from military sites around the world (even apparent black sites like area 51), talk of pedos and pizza, extraordinary renditions from Iraqi Freedom/Enduring Freedom, the planes used, etc., etc., etc.

          There is some info to gloss through. Very interesting considering the current investigation. They even mentioned stratfor, which was mentioned in the WikiLeaks as creating the "pizza website" that made millions.

           TL;DR: The government wants to control perception and quell dissent. One way they do this is by using Apple's unique identifiers to assemble a giant database about our name, zip code, etc... and use phones as a tracking device.

        The site was talked about since at least 2007. Apparently it was weird then too. There is updated info from at least 2015 as well.

        It is definitely active and contains real info, like the VIP contact dump.

      I had an idea but I can't really handle it in here, so I'll just comment here and hopefully someone will pick it up. The first season of True Detective suggested all of this and then copped out in the last episode maybe because of pressure. I think the creator Nic Pizzolatto may know something. Just a suggestion. Again, I can't really help you guys as this is way too much for me, but that's a thought I had if anybody wanted to look into it. Thanks.

       Would explain why the 2nd season was such a total failure, if somebody connected to this leaned on the studio after season 1 was too close to home. Forced them to drastically change the subject and content of the show and sink its ratings. Our maybe Pizzolatto just burnt out.

        I didn't watch the second season because of the massive cop out at the end of the first.  However, I think he left so many clues as to suggest the "ending" wasn't a happy one by any stretch.

          Come on man, there were suggestions that there was a vast conspiracy and pedophilia ring. And it turns out it's just a weird lawn mower guy? They spent the entire show littering clues throughout about Marty's daughter, the governor, etc. My personal theory is that Marty was involved. If you look he has a similar ring as the head of that church. He is a degenerate sexually, his daughter is beyond fucked up, he's the one who kills the guy at the hidden compound (why? because the guy could recognize him?) Marty blows the whole lid off this entire decade long case, how? With the most mundane piece of bullshit evidence ever witnessed on a tv show: green ears. On a show called True Detective the biggest detective breakthrough was a guy with paint on his ears. No. what I think really happened was that Marty knew that Russ was never going to stop. He knew that he would be exposed sooner or later. So he had to make a choice: either kill Russ or find another way to make him stop. As you recall when they meet on the road he does consider killing him. Instead, he throws Russ a bone. He fingers Errol and they go after him. Despite mountains of evidence of a vast conspiracy, Russ is all too willing to accept this bone. He is tired, he wants more than anything in the world to have closure for his daughter, so he willfully ignores the bigger aspects of the case and settles for Errol. At the end, he opines that the "light is winning" or some bullshit. This is just him rationalizing to himself that he doesn't need to keep going. Marty gets off scott free and we pan to the night sky where, is the light really winning?  If you look at the behavior of Marty and his daughter throughout the season, you'll see what I'm talking about.

      This has been done and I'm all but certain Reynolds' name appears in Epstein's book but is a slightly misspelled. "Raynolds," perhaps? The word "massage" is proximal to his name which makes for a stronger tie.

    This is a side note from the #pizzagate-related efforts -- as I first started to comb through the all the leaks using Tamera Luzzatto as the search term... I was immediately jarred/confused by an strange email she sent to HRC in reference to 9-11 (https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/1747):
   </p>
   <p>
    "Finally, finally, and hope I didn't say this already, I started yesterday am sending an anniversary greeting and ode to Team 9-11 Clinton to everyone there when we waited for you to come in (for the Mrs. Bush testimony coincidentally) and watched the 2nd plane, and of course the rest was our amazing journey together of work to be so proud of. I even included Ramon on the chain!!! Impossible it now seems."
   </p>
   <p>
    Am I the only one extremely confused by the context/nature of this email?
   </p>
   <p>
    Anyways... aside from all the "Farm L party" references, I picked out a few below.
   </p>
   <p>
    https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/33373 - Responding to a cryptic cooking reference from Karen Sack (Podesta Cc'd): "this is great, and I can report that Chef John is cooking away to raise a different kind of dough for our next president! xoxo, T"

   </p>
   <p>
    https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/12621: Farm, lettuce, and herb reference
   </p>
   <p>
    https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/47943: "We had a Luzzattopalooza yesterday, with Marisa-Paul-10 month Evie staying 
with us already while their house gets painted, and Ben-Alex sledding their 
3 over to "help" us decorate the tree. When the parents got back to 
retrieve children, they threw in the towel (and about 19 pieces of winter 
clothing) to stay for tortellini and an overnight. So, 6 grownups with 2 
toddlers and 2 infants spread throughout the house, and sure enough one of those toddlers was rubbing my nose at 5:45.........." This is not normal
   </p>
   <p>
    https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/18471: More vegetable reference "Tomatoes galore, beans, yellow squash, okra, and more. He will drop me off at Dulles today at 2:30--I'm flying to hook up with my father for a service for one of the 3 remaining of his 9 siblings until we lost one last Tuesday, and he was a fave uncle, to Minn--so the farmer can do drop offs on way into DC. Best to all. Xox, Tamera"

     So I looked into where Laura Bush was
     <a href="http://911blogger.com/news/2012-06-18/laura-bush-911-why-was-presidents-wife-left-vulnerable-and-unprotected">
      on 9/11/01
     </a>
     . At 10, she was "scheduled to appear before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and talk about early childhood education.
    </p>
    <p>
     [She] thought the Senate hearing should perhaps be canceled, because New York Senator Hillary Clinton was supposed to attend it. Bush has said that after learning of the first crash, 'I thought we probably should cancel, because Mrs. Clinton was on the [Senate education] committee and she's from New York, and she'd probably want to rush home at that time.'"
    </p>
    <p>
     So yeah, looks like Mrs. Bush very much expected to testify before a Senate Committee (and Hillary) that morning. Why is Luzzatto interested in that? And what does any of it have to do with health, education, labor, and pensions? And why mention Laura Bush? It's probably not very helpful, but I felt like I should mention it.

     <p>
      Good work. Here's my take, based on Luzzatto's bio in N Magazine:
     </p>
     <p>
      TL had just started working for Hillary as chief of staff in her Senate office. Luzzatto was probably at the Capitol waiting for Hillary to arrive for the committee hearing when the 1st plane hit the towers. Being the junior Senator from NY, this would be a major event for Hillary's staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      It's unclear from her syntax whether or not Hillary arrived by the time the second plane hit, but it seems to suggest that Hillary ultimately did show up to the Capitol, and was with Laura Bush during the Pentagon attack, collapse of the towers, etc.
     </p>
     <p>
      I think the "(...Mrs. Bush testimony COINCIDENTALLY)" refers to earlier in the email, when Luzzatto spoke about good vibes between the two first ladies to a Politico reporter for some puff piece.
     </p>
     <p>
      It's probably nothing, but can anyone find press/book excerpts about Laura Bush and Hillary, and Where They Were on the morning of 9/11? Was Hillary with that big group of Congresspeople who sang "God Bless America" on the Capitol steps?

       I found
       <a href="https://youtu.be/PZe3jL7CXPs">
        this interview
       </a>
       the night of 9/11/01 with Hillary and at 3:17 it's mentioned that she was in the Capitol Building when it was evacuated. It's not clear whether or not she was on the steps with everybody else, but the way they're talking it sounds like she probably was.

    excellent work.  Thank you!  I feel like a small team of young FBI agents could bust this open easily in a few weeks.  Are higher ups covering up?

      over at r/conspiracy, one theory is that Comey has an elite team of "untouchable" agents that are gonna bust the whole thing open and save the day.  I hope so but I'm too cynical to expect it.

         Don't trust them either, I'd say some of the cops wud spill, but the brass I'd say is corrupt as anyone, and I'm sure they have ways of making an investigation die...someone in nypd or FBI is gunna hafta break ranks and blow the whistle the agencies as a whole will not do it

     i wish someone in the FBI would start leaking.  We want to believe there's at least some people in the FBI who want this shit cleaned up but its clear the FBI is involved in some sort of power struggle that is hampering the investigation.  Some individual agents need to step up and start leaking or its getting harder to believe the FBI is actually interested in cleaning up any of this child trafficking/pedo shit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Supposedly, the NYPD threatened to leak stuff if the FBI didn't get off their bum.  Haven't seen anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     Individual officers/agents need to realize the system isn't going to clean itself.  Individual officers/agents are going to have to take responsibility for making sure the Clintons get the sunlight they need to disinfect the rest of us.  Investigations are being stalled.  The Clintons and other pedos are going to not just get away with it but be allowed to harm more kids.
    </p>
    <p>
     From here on out, every agent aware of the evidence against the Clintons but acquiesces to stonewalling is complicit to every child the Clintons and their associates fuck up.

        Can we get some Jewish folks to check out this guys poems? Possibly someone with an ancestry.com account to check if the Luzzatto's are related to this old rabbi. Could this confirm their use of gematria? SOMEONE READ HIS POEMS

     <p>
      The link appears on the 4th page of results, "How is your consciousness like their own monstrous unitary dumpster"

      there are links after links after links of weird webpages, it's insane, almost a work of art, no clue what it could mean though, it's really insane, the flashes are potentially epilepsy inducing, if you have a history of this, maybe pass your turn

      Thank you for OP.   This is by far the most damning evidence yet unearthed.   Even more than Jimmy's instagram and Tony's art collection/Hastert link.   This info needs to be at the top of every analysis of pizzagate.

      there is something that you can click in the top left hand corner and then there are a ton of images that start cycling. i nope'd out right away. not sure if someone else can replicated that. it was weird, like a translucent bar with a broken icon that said "apple" something. and then the tab at the top changed to a bunch of vertical lines like: ||||  ||| |||||| || |||||

     MK Ultra Stylings. I've seen a few sites like this that lead to DIY Church that had contact information from security workers in train depots and ports. As I was downloading the sites, some of them were taken down, but there is a whole rabbit warren of them, with the weird symbols and colors.

       Clicked the "Pinks attempt to penetrate the Orifice." link on above link, and it lead to a forum speaking of a strange poster. The poster links seems broken though. https://web.archive.org/web/20161117144654/http://www.blizzhackers.cc/viewtopic.php?t=357587&amp;start=0&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=

       But do notice some of the symbols used by various users on the board. I wanted to upload a images to my pizzathrow imgur account, but it simply wouldn't let me. Don't wanna jump to the conclusion, that the account is being censored. It does seems strange though.

        The pedo heart-within-heart symbol is displayed on one of the comments, someone quotes "Jason Fall, The State of the Comet", "I don't care what they say, I don't care if I'm the villian, I don't need their acceptance, I only need your hand."  Along with a quote from Lewis Carroll: "Still she haunts me, phantomwise; Alice moving under skies; never seen by waking eyes." Alice in Wonderland. Alice is a symbol to pedos too because of Carroll's alleged relationship with the girl he based it on, thus the pedo holiday "Alice Day"

        If you google Bentley Ptythylhlyl's unusual last name, you'll find flicker, linked-in, and even a facebook account. That leads to a website full of pseudoscience babble. I almost think somebody was creating a character for an ARG -- an Alternate Reality Game. Having a unique name makes it easier for players to avoid bothering real people.
        <em>
         shrug
        </em>
        But that's just my take.

         Possible but I think unlikely because it's so old. The site may be slide, but all the contact information that's listed just seems odd.

     Even more strange is that the music sounds very creepy and familiar, like the Heavy Breathing music.

     The captioned gif that is too fast too read says "Erotic dolls or the work of a twisted murdered? Few can say".
The gifs are nsfw btw.

     CTRL+F "Clinton" comes back with 118 results, it also has a phone number next to her name.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why would a nsfw .gif page have her name and her phone number 118 times?

         Make it weird and ruin the aesthetics of it, and people won't bother delving into it. But I'm totally done for today. The last link was as far as I'm willing to go at this point.

    Yeah this right here should be enough of a red flag to be investigated. Also, infant massage therapist? I went to the link you posted and dude it's not even close to believable. The whole thing read like a person who just didn't really know HOW to lie try and cling to a lie.

     In the field of infant massage, the practitioner teaches the parent how to perform the massage. It is taught that the parents should do the massaging as one of the goals is connection with the child, and that should not be done by the therapist, just the parent. There's something definately wrong if that guy is doing the actual massages. I'm a massage therapist.

    I'm not a parent, but I have many friends who are parents and grandparents. None of them have a blog dedicated to the daily, mundane actions of their children or grandchildren.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you follow the links of the followers, it takes you on a strange trail of identically-themed blogs; each dedicated to apparently benign posts of small children.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm struck by the following idiosyncrasies:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Same template and style of blogging for numerous sites.
    </li>
    <li>
     Followers and commenters are strange. Seemingly random foreigners and not much feedback from actual friends and family (I would have to spend hours tracking down the breadcrumbs, but that's the general impression I get).
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Someone should dig into this person's
    <a href="http://rockhopers.blogspot.com/">
     other blog/s
    </a>
    . Wish I had the time to make all the connections.

      Someone needs to archive everything on every one of these blogs. I suspect that this is how they advertise the farming out of these children. Incidentally, lots of farm-related posts and discussions.
     </p>
     <p>
      It's as though these children are livestock...

      There are hundreds and hundreds of pages. Try saving every picture you see to see what it was labeled. There are some that are very "cryptic." I can't think of any examples off the top of my head, it's been a long time looking at this shit.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is evil hidden in there.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is a pastbin somewhere with all the contacts listed. There is also another page somewhere with more contact info but I lost it.

This was created by the shills at the z-sec. There is someone apparently from z-sec moderating this thread now. Their answers don't really match up and lead to more questions, which they've dodged. Mods are deleting posts questioning them, some have been banned. The fact that they came here to "save face" with such a bullshit story only further proves their guilt. Be careful.

         Okay, I've pretty much moved on to looking at Bollywood style jewelry on Amazon right now.  :-)  I worked hard all day, I think I'll just stick the "news," such as I can find it on our MKUltra'd internet ...

       Thanks. Glad I didn't see The Donald or Bernie in there.  My friend thinks this site was built by foreign agents to distract us; I said it's definitely a distraction, but probably the CIA is MKUltra'ing us some more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or ... I had this thought, maybe this is the new "numbers stations?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Or ... maybe this is a schizophrenic's life's work and s/he has also been following WikiLeaks, PizzaGate, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if some of the coordinates leading to military installations are in the WikiLeaks too.

        Idk what to think but that website has to be legit. It could be a schizo conspiritard that stumbled into a real case. "Reverse engineering the Bush presidency" was his stated goal. Did he stumble upon this while digging?

    That infant massage therapist Kevin Reynolds...I did a Google Image search for this man and one photo stuck out, which brought me to this website:

    I really want this all to stop coming full circle, but it won't stop...
   </p>
   <p>
    paging /u/garydeepwebb ~~I think he'll want to see this.~~ lol I should have finished reading your post! As it turns out, the same photo with Bill is on his vacation concierge website.
   </p>
   <p>
    You highlighted the second paragraph at his massage website, but it's the first paragraph that really bothers me:
   </p>
   <p>

   <p>
    So he outsources the actual babysitting to a candidate??

    Theres a line between busting a pedo ring and becoming the sjwfeminazi that calls the police on the single dad who takes his daughter to the park.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     "This is pretty self-explanatory pedo talk"
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    No, it's not. I mean, I guess it might be, I'm not an expert on pedos, but I do know that old ladies always talk like this about how their houses get filled up with family members. If it is pedo talk it's indistinguishable from normal grandma talk.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now the blogs and the websites and the choice of words "raw and uncut" "something sick" is fucking strange as hell and super suspicious.
   </p>
   <p>
    But be careful. Not every one who interacts with children are raping them. Don't cross that line. If you turn that into clearly pedo talk, then millions of grandmas across the nation are suddenly indistinguishable from child rapists.

    Doesn't one of the e-mails talk about waiting for the grandkids so they can gobble up/destroy some cheeses?  In context of the other e-mails, could this be introducing/reinforcing "dominance" among the grandkids?  Like teaching/reinforcing the grandkids are entitled to power over others as part of the "natural order"?
   </p>
   <p>
    If I was a parent introducing my kids into this fcked up sht, I'd probably want my kids to be the dominant ones, in control of whatever situation they found themselves in.

      Pasta means adolescent.  Think al dente.  It makes more sense when it's child vs. adolescent than boy vs. girl.

    Can I just say, why the fuck would you HEAT up a pool and talk about children ages 7 to 11 joining you in that pool and refer to that as entertainment? This emails are public, where the FUCK are the sirens?

    The address provided for that farm get together lists a business and possibly another person there tied to an E Street Gallery with 2 websites registered to the same address. THIS needs a pede investigation to confirm or throw it out... ICANN on whitewillows.com appears to lead down another rabbit hole. the images provided for the art gallery appear somewhat disturbing too.

    Concerning this instagram comment "enjoy the bananas wrapped in ham and topped with cheese sauce!". I guess she was referencing this buzzfeed post https://www.buzzfeed.com/ariannarebolini/truly-upsetting-vintage-recipes?utm_term=.deNjymKRp#.ixWG3M560                            The 2nd and 16th pic are "banana dishes" that reminded me of her comment.

    Not sure if people noticed but a post a few days ago pointed out that the Rockefeller Foundation gave the Center For American Progress(Podesta's PAC) a grant of $900,000 that just ended Oct. 31st this year.  The reasoning given was "Strategic Partnerships".

     This doesn't come off as a natural photo. It's more like a, "look what we have for sale" type photo. Normally, the previous statement could be laughed off as a self-fulfilling prophecy, but the strange/cryptic dialogue makes it seem very dark. There's something very bad going on at "evie's crib"

    Many of your points are total conjecture. You need to do better if you want this to go anywhere. I'm seeing a lot of this in our subs. Conjecture. It damages the credibility of the legit stuff others are exposing.

     i'm not saying the info above is smoking gun-level truth, but I've noticed that people are generally rushing past the Luzzatto link, and I wanted to remind researchers that she's not just some Washington woman who knows Podesta; she was HILLARY'S CHIEF OF STAFF for 8 fucking years in the Senate.
    </p>
    <p>
     John Podesta was Bill's chief of staff, and he's a prime suspect in the pedo hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tamera Luzzatto was Hillary's chief of staff, she's deeply connected to the Nantucket/Martha's Vineyard/Caribbean islands crowd, she apparently associates with a sketchy infant massage therapist...
    </p>
    <p>
     All I'm saying is keep her name in the back of your mind as you research

      I get it, but it's still harmful to the cause IMO. it's becoming McCarthy-esque and as a community we need to be aware of it and filter it out. Some of the other stuff people are now throwing around in conjunction with your work is pretty absurd. The lady just looks like a proud and happy grandmother to me. The massage guy, if you had a special needs kid you'd understand that better. It's a legit profession. Kids born with muscular or skeletal issues need hours upon hours of corrective massaging so their limbs will grow and function properly. But nobody brings up THAT possibility. My point is, people are seeing dirty pedo shit EVERYWHERE they look and I'm starting to think a lot of the people here simply WANT to see it no matter what. And it's making us all look like fools. There's an astonishing lack of objectivity going around. A photo of a proud grandmother with her grandkids and her private blog about her granddaughter is spun as some kind of pedo outreach instead of what it in likely is. It's counterproductive. Her email about the party and the kids and the pool, same thing. Nobody around here is interpreting the info the OTHER way, and that SHOULD BE cause for concern. Some of the researchers around here are seeing pedo shit EVERYWHERE. As I said, it's getting pretty McCarthy and the shit needs to be checked before it fucks us all up.

        dude, fuck both you. you can't handle logical rebuttals. shout down as CTR/shill anyone who disagrees with your patently obvious conjecture? i've been doing this BBS shit since modems had receiver terminals. I'm TOR'd up, change accounts regularly. Stay on Podesta. THAT'S THE FUCKING STORY. You're just jacking yourselves off with this grandmother and her blog.

    I'm not sure what all this crap is but I opened the 
http://octagon.lhohq.info/justin-bieber.html (OK weird)
If you click anywhere on the page it brings up some more weird stuff
http://octagon.lhohq.info/francais_institut_octroyer.html
There is a not so obvious link at the bottom of that page in pink which brings you here:
http://www.lhohq.info/laughing_horses_orifice_corporate_headquarters.html
and then more possible links;
http://www.lhohq.info/laughing_horses_orifice_corporate_headquarters.html
   </p>
   <p>
    I have no idea what half of this shit is supposed to mean but if you are looking for rabbit holes this is the place to find them.
   </p>
   <p>
    The trick with these pages is to look at the source code in your browser and look for links there rather than looking for them normally.
They are deliberately hidden.

    If you click on the profile of Mr. T on the Evies crib blog, this Mr. T has one other blog (edit, he is a contributer to this blog, it has about ten), CHECK THE TOP POST it's about the duggars molesting their children.

    The rest of the blog is super odd too, why do these people have the shittiest looking blogs ever?

    What the heck is this nonsense?
   </p>
   <p>
    The Koch Bros. issue one mild reading between the lines missive and all of a sudden the unruly children are picking up the play area. Amazing what a few billion dollars can do to refocus the political mind, especially one whose place in power has been bought by that same money in the first instance and whose only economic alternative is as a shoe or car salesman. (Does the blatant ignorance of these Tea Party representatives not scare you?) - Of course it is great fun to manipulate the gullible voters through their prejudices and mythologies, and to hype the evils of "big government" when in pursuit of lower taxes and stymying regulation of your extraction industries etc., if you are a self-centered billionaire, but a whole lot less fun when the morons you have sold to the gullible public start to really act on all that BS you have underwritten them to say; threatening to turn the world economy and all your vested wealth into a vapor of chaos, which is were everything goes in the absence of rational government. I love the laundry list of government agencies the Reps. have been feverishly voting to reopen, it reminds one of Perry's debate, as it would seem that even collectively now, they can't remember what part of the government it was that we did not

     On Mr. T's other blog, http://rockhopers.blogspot.ca/, they seem to call themselves Clan Snoddy. When you googled clan snoddy, the only possible connection I found was on: https://www.houseofnames.com/snoddy-family-crest
    </p>
    <p>
     Under contemporary notables of the name Snoddy, there is a John C. Snoddy who was an American Republican politican, delegate to Republican National Convention from North Carolina in 1924.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe these blog contributors are all descendants of the Snoddy family and connected in some way to the pedo ring?
    </p>
    <p>
     EDIT: They refer to themselves as Clan Snoddy on several posts. Here are some:

    Before I am downvoted all to hell for mentioning this... the comment on that image "enjoy the bananas wrapped in ham and topped with cheese sauce!" sounds just like the kind of weird, but thoughtful food combos a lot of kids come up with to present to their parents. Most likely an innocent comment from a family member...

    Leiter's nickname doesn't appear to be Vudu but Vuvu. Look through the Facebook photo posts of Tamera Luzzatto. Did someone fake the screencaps? https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3994854024851&amp;type=3&amp;theater

    If you google 'bananas wrapped in ham' this is actually a thing.  There are many pictures and website recipes talking about bananas wrapped in ham with cheese sauce over it.  Just saying.

     Coupled with the email and her involvement with the farm parties, I don't see how you can come up with "Evie's crib site doesn't look off to me."

     Spending time with infants "raw and uncut" is NOT how infants should be spent time with. That one statement is enough of a red flag to raise attention. Remain skeptical, but not entirely dismissive.

      this is pretty much how I felt reading it "Yeah looks like normal grandmom/extended family interaction, nothing off there.  WAIT A MINUTE!  RAW AND UNCUT???? WTF!"

       That's the type of wording that would immediately make you think of a porno or something...."Raw and Uncut!" like wtf... there is absolutely no context where that statement would be normal to use when speaking about infants....
