        <strong>Not sure if this is relevant, but since Elijah Wood came out about the pedo rings, it's notable that Macauley Culkin's band is called Pizza Underground, and they cover Velvet Underground songs to be about pizza. :(</strong>

        <p><p>Notice how he says "I just finished pizza." Not "I just had a slice of pizza." And how he stares off like he did something wrong after he eats it for a whole minute. It's weird. Nobody else seems too interested in the Pizza Underground stuff on this subreddit though</p></p>

        <p><p>Did you also know that the Pizza video was a direct copy of a video by Andy Warhol eating a cheeseburger</p></p>
