<strong>Imagine this...</strong>
<p><p>Imagine your a deeply liberal, political, homosexual that's deeply into s &amp; m and deviant sexual behaviors. Your also a meticulous egotistical gourmet pizza cuisine chef. You are also a dark, new age, hipster. You also own a thriving commercially successful restaurant in a low key locals area of the most corrupt concentration of political power in the world. Youve somehow created and maintained a niche market in the means of a chuck e cheese type place, except with ping pong instead of arcade games. A kid friendly environment in DC. it's a pizza place that doubles as a gay bar by night essentially, and it is often  a haven for today's young adult liberal hipsters, mainstream counterculture, with deviant dark undertones tho. Alot of responsibilty lies on the parents/patrons of this place that deem it acceptable to make this place by getting their kids mixed up in this, deeming it acceptable to bring them here and trusting them to the dark undertones, thus transfusing them and assimilatimg them into this dark culture. But isnt that what we like to do, once we justify something as ok, i.e. trick ourselves into accepting that whatever ones natural inclinations are is healthy and ok, thus gay people are awesome, and family friendly so lets bring or kids here and mingle them in it too, even though they aren't mature enough to evaluate this stuff yet , but all in the name of the idea that because sexuality and s and m and whatever your into is something to be proud of because its what your into and your honest about it and you dont choose what your into..! Err..  morality becomes relative. So besides just taking ourselves down this experimental theory , Lets indoctrinate our children too,  into our beauiful open mindedness. Well James alefantis is the poster boy of this new "twist" on things , he has branded this and is the blind leading the blind , and many employees and families are subscribing inadvertently to  this brand of some weird shit that is begging to get out of hand quickly if it hasnt already. So I'm thinking the kids are loyal patrons family and employees children being allowed to come around these  sick twisted events /concerts. And people like the podestas are happy to come enjoy the youthful spirit, as all old people are drawn to youth, aren't they so cute and full of life and vibrant? The only pure and innocent thing left in this sick world. this is very mich more dark and or possibly sadistic to me than your avwrage admiration of youth. At any rate, what would you expect the owner james alefantis instagram to look like? and this little world that has been created by so many intertwining strange components? I would expext it to look just like this. Illegal or not, what he's doing is boldly arrogant on display, and we need to find our if beneath it there is truly nefarious activity. The appearance alone is almost in my mind punishable just for creating false pretense </p></p>

<p><p>As long as you are not equating homosexuality with deviant sexual behaviors I completely agree with you.  There is undoubtedly disgusting innuendo on display in all of the social media accounts surrounding Comet Ping Pong.  I have said the same thing, Alefantis is a small potato that has effectively provided a playground for the "elite cabal" we think Podesta is involved in.  Everything else aside, the suggestive social media posts are disgusting, and no morally responsible adult should subject their children to the deviant undercurrent we have exposed at Comet Ping Pong.  I think you are exactly right, most of these people believe they are part of an "open-minded", progressive movement, and may not even be cognizant of the disgusting shit going on.</p></p>

<p><p>For that matter, we shouldn't be associating deviant sexual behavior with pedophilia. Fetishes are fine, unless they involve someone who hasn't or can't consent. These people fuck kids, who can't consent.</p></p>

<p><p>Pedophilia is deviant sexual behavior.  Kids, young children, do not need to be involved in sexuality whatsoever </p></p>

<p><p>Yes, it is. But some people consider BDSM, lactation, foot worship, and other harmless fetishes "deviant sexual behavior" as well. We are against pedophilia, not ALL deviant sexual behavior.</p></p>

<p><p>I've heard an argument about this being the liberal-globalist process.</p>
<p>Split up the family nucleus (Clinton passed the marijuana bill to lock up inner city fathers, making single-parent families rely on welfare.)</p>
<p>Push the agenda that sexual deviances etc are acceptable (this is becoming a lot more prevalent in our current gender-flux society.)</p>
<p>Spur the genders against each other as much as possible (feminism, MRA)</p>
<p>Suppress dissent (PC, SJW)</p>
<p>It makes it a lot easier to distract people while you take power, while at the same time making all NAMBLA-esque preferences more socially-acceptable.</p>
<p>Haven't made up my mind about this, but the links are there and it's an interesting thought-process. </p></p>

<p><p>The culture is definitely becoming more and more desensitized. We're already seeing pedophilia begin to be classified as a "disease" and some are sympathic to the victims it afflicts not only the children they abuse. Penalty's are often less than that of deug traffickers which to me is unacceptable </p></p>
