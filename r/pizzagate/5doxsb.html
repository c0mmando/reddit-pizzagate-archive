     Seems buggy maybe? Not trying to nitpick but it seems like every month has a few days of nothing (when you look at month by month, average per week hides it). It's a strange pattern - several days of relatively high activity and then dead days. It might have to do with the way Google records and reports data, perhaps? Also, didn't she die much more recently than July?

      Or it could have to do with someone who is working on her case and only works during the week/certain days?

      Yes obviously I am saying he said the textbook was awfully researched and continually offered the opportunity for a student to write a critique, she then made it the focus of her term paper and spent years after writing a 110 page thorough critique &amp; that he is still looking for publishers. I understand her death was suspicious in Haiti but theres a chance this reference of his was separate and simply telling of her dedication that probably led to her death

       he did mention "we may never know what happened to her"
pretty sure he doubts her cause of death and he seemed very close to her.

        A friend of hers said in one of the comment threads on FB that she was murdered. I'm upload screenshot now, will update in couple minutes.

         Ya, people need to demand a police report about this, there should be pictures, as gruesome as that is to say. Yet if we are just going by the word of Haitian police and leaving it at that, yea, people are going to doubt the suicide.

            I actually am not sure it's legit. Not ruling it out though. It's possible that what seemed like a suicide yesterday escalated since then to a likely murder investigation - who knows - maybe we helped put the pressure on the local police.

           That last comment - "We are in a state of shock ... We may never know what exactly happened to her" - begins at the 43:45 mark.

            I just watched the video. The "report" she wrote was simply a report to show research flaws in a textbook. A textbook written by a famous person in the field of human trafficking (that's the demagogue the prof is talking about). Writing that report was a project that her professor (guy speaking) suggest someone try to do...and she did. The prof says its going to be hard to find publishers because its an academic critique of a famous textbook...thats all... Sorry to point this in a different direction but the ONLY thing this guy said that really relates to our cause is that he said: "we may never know what happened"...

             All right, so maybe we could find a lead by looking at which textbooks on human trafficking are most well known. Possible place to start digging: https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/human-trafficking

      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       "Current Associate projects involved an examination child trafficking in Russia,
       <strong>
        a critique of Haiti’s restavik system
       </strong>
       , an analysis of vulnerability reduction techniques to human trafficking used by women who have been displaced by the armed conflict in Colombia, and an examination of the complexities of male demand for prostitution and how it directly affects sex trafficking. Associates work in coordination with partnering NGOs, international organizations and government agencies on topics that HTC partners identify as priorities."
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I believe this is what she was working on. Either that, or she disagreed with an official analysis of the situation in Haiti which she suspected was bought. Remember, this ring has tentacles in every part of the trafficking scene - including prevention, education, and prosecution - it is very likely she detected a suspicious report and suspected a colleague of doctoring evidence.
