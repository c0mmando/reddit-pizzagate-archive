    Looking for volunteers for research initiative.
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Hi folks,
   </p>
   <p>
    I need some help with a research project that is going to approach Pizzagate obliquely. There is a mountain of available evidence from multiple international VIP pedo scandals that needs to coordinated against the knowns of Pizzagate. If we can compile lists of perps, victims, businesses/owners, we should hopefully find some correlation to the Pizzagate assholes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Frankly there is so much information out there I don't think I'm going to be able to do this on my own. I don't have the time or tech skills needed to really give this the full research power it needs.
   </p>
   <p>
    I really need help on this.
   </p>
   <p>
    What I'm asking for is for people who would like to take on a piece of a larger project in a collaboration to find links and resources which we could tie back to Pizzagate.
   </p>
   <p>
    Please, if you think you might be able to help out a little with some research let me know and I will PM you some additional information on the project.

    Sure. Sounds like what you want is a database that can basically do an analysis like on big data, find connections etc. right?

     Pretty much, yes. I think if we can create a huge list of perps, victims, locations, etc... Then some of these might correlate and help us find newer and better leads with Pizzagate. I think it's extremely unlikely the international incidents are not connected.

      Best thing would be to set up a private IRC group through OnionIRC via Tor. Install either Tails or Kali Linux (requires additional terminal commands to install Tor) on a live USB to boot into.
     </p>
     <p>
      I use Ruufus to make my live USB's. Here are some links to download the software needed for Tor and Rufus.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rufus: https://rufus.akeo.ie/ 
Tails: https://tails.boum.org/ 
Kali Linux: https://www.kali.org/
Tor Bundle (If decide not to make a bootable USB): https://www.torproject.org/
OnionIRC: https://www.anonymousvideo.eu/anonymous-network-onion-irc.html

        That's what the word on the street is saying that the exit nodes are compromised. Although I do not know how many nodes exist,however I do know that 96% of all internet content is located on the deep web so that's a lot of ground to track for them and it offers a hell of a lot more security than Safari, IE, Firefox, Chrome, does in terms of privacy

         Right right in not trying to dispute that's where the info should be looked for, I've just been staying away since it's easy to get linked to something wrong.

          I understand but know this, merely by posting in this sub and other related subs, they already know who you are and where you're located. Snowden didn't expose the NSA for nothing. But at least on Tor you're better protected than you are discussing this investigation and our findings on the top web.

           For sure. I've used some programs on Kali..not nearly versed in it as required. But it's fun to play around with. Keep me updated on anything ya find?

            The terminal commands to install tor are easy and there's multiple google search results with tutorials that make it simple. Trust me, if wiki is compromised and some of the subs are compromised then discussing our investigation on the surface is only impeding our efforts and could lead to more cover ups and silencing. If you're all aboard the investigation train, we need to go under the surface.
