        <strong>Anthony Podesta lobbies on behalf of cocaine smuggling ring?</strong>
        <p><p>To start, Miroslav Mišković is a Serbian business magnate and the 2nd richest person in Serbia. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2007 Forbes magazine estimated his net worth at more than $1 billion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/05/world/europe/tycoons-trials-rivet-serbia-land-of-graft.html</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The owner of “Delta Holding”, Miroslav Miskovic, laundered dirty money of the fugitive drug lord Darko Saric, published today the Informer newspaper, citing the police report from a joint Serbian and Dutch police and prosecutors investigation, to which, according to the newspaper, it had access, reported Tanjug… According to Informer, “East Europe Investment Fund”, of which Miroslav Miskovic is the “hidden” owner, paid for alleged consulting services to Saric’s company “Financial Angels LLC” EUR 2,500,095 in only one transaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://inserbia.info/today/2013/07/miroslav-miskovic-did-money-laundering-for-darko-saric/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the newspaper reported, investigators claim that this was a fictional deal and that Miskovic actually took the “dirty money” from Saric, which he later legalized through his business with a large percentage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company Financial Angels LLC was incorporated on January 23rd 2006, by two Serbian Internationals. The registered office was that of the agent, Harvard Business Services Inc. </p>
<p>https://www.reportingproject.net/peopleofinterest/documents/Darko_%C5%A0ari%C4%87,_Companies_287.pdf</p>
<p>From HBS’s Website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You do not have to live in, or even visit, the state of Delaware in order to form a Delaware company. Other than residents of restricted countries (Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea and Syria), anyone can form a Delaware company and operate lawful business activities from anywhere in the world. You do not have to be an American citizen to form and/or operate a Delaware company… Delaware's corporate law structure does not impose restrictions on ownership or management of a Delaware company by a non-resident of the United States.</strong> Although Delaware corporations and LLCs are not required to have a physical presence in the state, you will need to enlist the services of a Delaware Registered Agent, as all Delaware companies are required to retain a Registered Agent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An additional piece of evidence tying Mišković to Darko Saric is Stanko Subotić, a Geneva-based Serbian businessman who was sentenced to six years imprisonment for abuse of office. </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanko_Suboti%C4%87#B92_Interview.2C_16_March_2010</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Šarić is a fugitive suspected of heading a drug clan responsible for an attempt to smuggle several tons of cocaine from South America to Europe. Mišković, owner of Serbia's largest privately-held company, Delta Holding, gave his statement for two hours on Thursday… Stanko Subotić in 2010 spoke about these alleged ties for B92, when he said that it was known that the brothers Šarić are friends of Marko Mišković, the son of the Delta owner.</p>

<p>Additionally, in 2012, Mišković and his son were arrested for embezzlement. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Serbia’s special prosecutor for organised crime said Mr Miskovic and a business partner were suspected of embezzling money and property worth about 2.87bn dinars (€25.4m) from privatised former state road companies. The tycoon had been questioned twice by police and prosecutors in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Mr Miskovic, 67, is one of the country’s most influential figures, whose Delta Holding has interests spanning real estate, retail, insurance and agriculture in Serbia and elsewhere in the Balkans. His group sold its Delta Maxi supermarket chain last year to Delhaize, the Belgium-based retailer, for €932.5m – one of the largest foreign investments in Serbia.</p>

<p>As far as the drug guy, he turned himself in around 2014 to authorities to “avoid a bloodbath.” </p>
<p>https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/2378-serbia-darko-ari-surrenders-to-avoid-bloodbath</p>
<p>There is a bunch of other illegal stuff, and the money connects to Tony Podesta.</p>
<p>Delta is actually structured under a company named Hemslade Trading Ltd, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hitomi Financial Ltd. “Hemslade, a wholly-owned subsidiary of HTM, will implement a partial demerger…” The SEC filings can be found here: </p>
<p>https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/930309/000119312511172887/dex49.htm</p>
<p>The SEC filing shows Miroslav Mišković with the power of attorney over Hitomi Financial, signed with Nenad Popović, former Vice-President of Democratic Party of Serbia as the witness. The buyer (Delhaize) isn’t important yet as far as I can tell.</p>
<p><strong>This article shows all the ties to Tony Podesta:</strong></p>

<p><strong>And the original Wikileaks cable:</strong></p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07BELGRADE1065_a.html</p>
<p>Additionally, Tatiana Ieronymides, who was head of Hemslade, resigned after corruption allegations against her husband.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR It seems that large chunks of The Podesta Group’s net income is the result of embezzlement and possible drug money from Serbian businessmen and politicians. The Podesta Group is basically paid to assert influence on U.S. politicians in order to apply international pressure on foreign governments to reduce the punishments of Serbian criminals in corruption scandals.</strong></p></p>
