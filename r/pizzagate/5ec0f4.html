    Ugh, I mean it's great that these guys are actually asking Alefantis questions to his face and getting his response - but could you guys try not to sound so stupid while you're talking DIRECTLY TO THE SUSPECT on camera? And maybe ask some more important questions than what you did? I mean, it sounded like you guys were really nervous 5 year olds unable to really articulate anything. I'm not trying to be mean, but if people are going to do things like this then they need to make sure they can handle it properly and be good at it. Anyways... Alefantis does seem to take this as a joke. His body language and demeanor... and that Jay Z reference... shady.

     Yeah this looks like paparazzi swarming around someone to stumble through some poorly planned questions. Guilty or not, I'm not surprised he's channeling some nervous energy. If someone were to approach me at a time like this my hands wouldn't be far from my concealed pistol. I guess it's hard to tell if they initiated the conversation more calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
     I wonder if JimmyComey would be willing to sit down for a more structured interview. I also wonder if he's lawyer'd up at this point.

      They did not expect to see Alefantis and confronted him spontaneously. Just as an explanation for why the guys seem a little bit stumbling.
     </p>
     <p>
      Just imagine wanting to take a look at the place and suddenly you talk to the man. I'd be nervous as fuck too. Even if you were prepared this kind of confrontation would be pretty frightening to say the least.
      <br/>
      Btw, I downloaded the vid and will back it up.

       Exactly! You see him on the spot, offcourse you are not a prepared journo at that point!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what it is now! News won't cover this one bit, so it's up to some smucks doing this. Offcourse It's gonna look a bit amateurish..
      </p>
      <p>
       These people who expect everything on a silver platter, why don't they go out there and confront this Alefantes and see how they stumble... These kids are soldiers!

       If I had received death threats and people approached me unnannounced, without clear intent I would make sure it's accessible. Age is irrelevant.

       For guidance in answering questions. There may be actual issues needing counsel, i.e. building w/o permits. Or his case with the cleaners. I'm not imagining an attorney present. But for guidance, yup.

     Agree. I don't think random, wanna-be-heroes confronting these people is very productive at all. You're making yourselves look like idiot conspiracy nuts, which is precisely what we don't want. Let this the open source investigation happen and gain some momentum on the internet, as it's been doing quite nicely. When it becomes big enough, the msm won't be able to ignore it anymore. We are at a time in history where they can't hide it anymore because of the Internet.

      Yea, I don't know wtf specifically he is talking about either. It's strange that he has an immediate response about Jay-Z to explain one of the photos as a "joke", even though I don't really know what the "joke" is supposed to be and I'm assuming the majority of people don't either. I, too, would like an explanation to what he's talking about.

      In the video for Blue Magic Jay-Z flashed a stack of Euros and the news went crazy over it.  https://i.imgur.com/IeU8Cai.png

      I wouldn't call it mainstream knowledge but I guess if you're a rap fan maybe you'd know about it.

     From what I understand he was there from Philly just to protest and hold #pizzagate signs outside, not to conduct an interview. Alefantis came out &amp; approached him and talked to him as I understand it. (based on the 'interviewers' twitter posts)

      The thought that this could be a counter-op has definitely crossed my mind as well.

     It is hard when it happens in the moment and you're not prepared. It's not like they had time to prepare specific questions, they are doing their best. I've been in similar situations and you can sometimes struggle to bring the most compelling evidence to the front of your mind, and then the pressure of the moment makes it even harder to do so. Then when you pause at all it makes you look less credible, so you just do your best.

      Sure there's a chance.  You know how people usually find these types of things out?  Through a criminal investigation.  Because that's what investigations are for.
     </p>
     <p>
      You know.  raids.  gathering of evidence.  surveillance.
     </p>
     <p>
      All
      <strong>
       BEFORE
      </strong>
      proving anyone guilty of anything.

     <p>
      I'll hold my breath for one to happen! (I won't)

      The thing is, if he is JUST a pizza shop owner, why so low scale? He is on the list  of 50 most powerful peeps in DC. If he was running a legit pizza place, one would think he would run one that matches his status. Secondly, one would HAVE to ignore his INTIMATE connections to David Brock, and that takes SERIOUS wilful ignorance. I have been saying we need Sibel Edmonds to finally get the more "mainstream" recognition she deserves. She connects the Clintons back to their co-Presidency, CoIntelPro2, she gave testimony to Congress, depositions in which she provided VIDEO, AUDIO, PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE of Hastert and other raping amd torturing kids. Literally video after video after video of these fuckers raping  children. http://www.bradblog.com/?p=7374

        Brock runs/ran Correct the Record (CTR) for Clinton, and just so happens to be James Alefantis' ex-gay lover/partner.
       </p>
       <p>
        R/The_Donald has some great threads on CTR. They're shills and basically peddle propaganda. Like something out of the USSR. The totally compromised/took over Reddit and other social media platforms. Very fucked up.

        Brock dated Alefantis, and if I recall Brock paid 850k in hush-money to an ex-lover to prevent him from leaking
        <em>
         something
        </em>
        damaging/incriminating about Brock and his organization Media Matters that would get him in trouble with IRS and if I recall Alefantis was a witness or co-defendant or something.
http://dailycaller.com/2012/02/27/media-matters-brock-paid-former-partner-850k-in-blackmail-settlement/
       </p>
       <p>
        From what I read the 850k settlement wasn't all the payments the blackmailer received as before it went to court he had paid him in smaller amounts in attempts to keep him from escalating
       </p>
       <p>
        Edit: That
        <em>
         something
        </em>
        is money laundering. Thanks to /u/LookAheadLolIDK for the link: http://www.thecitizensaudit.com/2016/09/19/money-laundering-david-brock/

      So the cage in the background of the picture of him rolling in blood is fine.

       The cage at comet is where the beer etc is locked up so it can't get stolen, pretty normal for restaurants.  Not sure that picture is of him though.

        They lock up beer on top of a ping pong table? That's a weird place for that.

         I deliver beer to restaurants for a beer distributed during the summer... it's absolutely normal to keep it locked up like an animal.

     Being accused of pedophilia is a potential death warrant. Societies reactions to stuff like that can be truly heinous. In certain situations, under certain circumstances, being publicly accused of pedophilia can turn into a lynching.

     You'll be beaten to death while a crowd cheers for your killers. Execute first, establish guilt later.

      I have seen enough connections to Comet Pizza to get me asking questions.
     </p>
     <p>
      I hear what you're saying. If he invited me in, I would take that as an open invitation to inspect the property for any wrongdoing. And that's what should be done. All speculation aside, I think we can all agree it deserves professional investigation.

      He knows there is no real evidence on him, and he's an insider to the point he's untouchable. That's what I think.

     OK, in his defense though, it's not everyday you're accused of heading up an international child trafficking ring out of your pizza parlour.

     Maybe because a bunch of insane people believe he's running a massive child pedophile ring?
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe because he and his staff are getting death threats from people they've never met on the internet?
    </p>
    <p>
     Just a thought.

      So if you're getting death threats do you walk outside to speak with protesters? Do you invite them in your establishment?
     </p>
     <p>
      He's not afraid. He's trying to talk his way out of it. Silence for weeks when this all broke and now suddenly he's firing back. I think those weeks were spent covering tracks and creating alibis. They think they can deescalate now, but the movement is just picking up steam and sticking their necks out now is practically a taunt.

       If I were him, I'd be afraid. Wouldn't you?
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, if I realized that a number of people had developed this theory, I'd probably want to answer questions to defuse the possibility that some unbalanced person was going to walk into my business one day and murder me or my staff under the belief that I was torturing children downstairs.

        What I'm trying to point out is that a person who is in fear of their life would only take an interview in a controlled setting, not on the fucking street with amateurs.
       </p>
       <p>
        This illustrates that he clearly isn't afraid.

         Regardless of his potential guilt or innocence, that just isn't rational.
        </p>
        <p>
         He owns a pizza parlor, and people are now camped outside it. Him going outside his own business is evidence that "he clearly isn't afraid"?
        </p>
        <p>
         If he stayed inside and slept there, would that be evidence of his guilt as well?

          It's not so much him going outside as it is how he attempts to dominate the interviewers who are trying to ask him tough questions. They weren't prepared so they flounder and don't press him, this is when he invites them in because he's able to see that they aren't prepared.
         </p>
         <p>
          If he was truly afraid of death threats he wouldn't be so casual with people shoving accusations at him. Innocent people tend to become upset when they're accused of something they didn't do. Especially with something this big. Have you ever been accused of stealing something from a friend/family member? Were they completely convinced you did when you know absolutely that you did not? Would you calmly deflect their accusations or would you become a bit emotional?
         </p>
         <p>
          He's not exhibiting any of that behavior. This means he's not concerned about his own safety from possible radicals, but rather he's already realized these guys aren't radicals and he's taking the opportunity to appear innocent to try and drive away the accusations.
         </p>
         <p>
          These people are sick, but sickness doesn't automatically mean stupidity. Imagine how often they'd use tone of voice and such to dominate children. Do you not think someone like Jimmy is quite well-versed in manipulative communication?

           I guess I don't see him trying to dominate his interviewers. They're asking questions about pictures cherry-picked from his Instagram, and he's answering them. When asked if they want to come inside, they say no.
          </p>
          <p>
           You are assuming there is something going on here that is evil, and maybe you're right, how would I know? But you're also viewing every action and piece of evidence through that lens, and filtering out anything that doesn't fit your pre-conceived notion.
          </p>
          <p>
           Maybe, just maybe, this guy isn't guilty of anything except for being a gay man who owns a pizza parlor and has avant-garde taste in art.

            Granted it's not an easy thing to see. It's very subtle and their ineptitude exasperates it even more because they make it so easy for him to deflect. It's no contest for him really. He dated David Brock ffs and is explicitly involved with the Podestas, both of whom worked with presidents.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, he's someone who knows how to act publicly and knows how to appear innocent. I'm sure he believes it himself (part of being a great actor is truly devoting yourself to the role).
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, isn't it convenient that the little girl is his "God Daughter"? There's literally no official document that could prove or disprove that fact. Why is 126 weeks so important to Alefantis? He makes a point to use that as a way to derail their questions. 126 weeks is irrelevant when the nature of the images is what's in question, but the way he says that to them, as if to say, "It's so old, why does it even matter?" is clearly a misdirection that he succeeds at pulling off.
           </p>
           <p>
            He's clearly prepared and they clearly were not. He probably had a laugh with whoever helped him prepare after this. Would be like Tom Brady playing a pick-up game with teenagers. He can dominate and never break a sweat.

      Not sure why you get down voted on this comment so hard.  Not every one who subscribes to this theory is insane, but it's definitely reasonable to assume they are getting death threats and have insane people showing up.  Not sure what the ratio actually is, but I'd imagine for every ten rational people, you probably get at least 1-2 nuts.  It's just the way the internet is.  Especially when it comes to conspiracy

       The downvotes make no difference to me. I just think everyone on this sub needs to take a hard look at what apophenia means before concretely deciding that people whom they've never met and have no connection to are running international crime syndicate sexually abusing and trafficking children, all on the basis of vague statements in emails and random pictures of Instagram.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll be the first person to applaud this sub if any of these allegations are founded, but it runs a very serious risk at this point of encouraging an unbalanced person to go "take justice" into their own hands.

     Let this be a lesson to us all. They've been silent for weeks preparing for a tumult of questions. Surely he's rehearsed enough so that a pop-up interview by amateurs isn't going to rile him up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Plan your questions. Plan for him to try and redirect. Plan questions to get back on track. Ask him to elaborate on
     <em>
      everything
     </em>
     . Tell him to explain it as if we're children. Use some subtle psychological cues to twist him up. If he's willing to do a candid interview, that's the best chance to get him to slip up.
    </p>
    <p>
     These guys seemed scared and dumbfounded. Obviously they've built him up as a villain and couldn't get past their emotions to remain objective. It's OK, though, not all is lost. We've learned from this that James is willing to entertain questions. Now let's get him on record flailing.

      Someone needs to make a list of 5-10 questions that reference the most damning evidence. Don't be afraid to bring up Podesta and Podesta emails. Remember, the Podesta connection is why we're here. It's not just about Comet.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ask him about how he knows Podest so well, about going to his house. Ask him about the hanging statue he took a photo of in Podesta's house, the Jeffery Dahmer one.
     </p>
     <p>
      The stuffed animals in Podesta's bedroom despite not having kids, the collection of Pedo art he has, the photos of naked teens in his bedroom.
     </p>
     <p>
      The countless sexual inuendo on Comet IG posts despite it being a 'family friendly' place. The interview with the manager where he says we look out for our customers and they look out for us.
     </p>
     <p>
      The band poster for an event there that literally depicts ritual child rape.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also, really really important is, ask him about sleepovers involving kids at Comet, because we have evidence that has occurred. (IG post) Ask him about the tunnel that was being dug from an IG post, ask him where that is.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ask him about the pedo logo at Besta, ask him about Besta, ask him who owns it, etc.

       Most importantly is to answer these questions beforehand in an effort to reduce guilt and deescalate. We should know what answers to look for and be able to counter those answers with more questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good rule of thumb to ascertain when someone is keeping things from you is when you ask for elaboration and they simply repeat their answer. This is a clear indication they've either rehearsed or are holding back and can't come up with a cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       The questions should be formulated in a flowchart with possible answers from Jimmy branching to different questions or asking for elaborations. He's been prepared, so any interviewers should do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like a good writer can plan their essay down to each sentence, a good interviewer already knows the answers to their questions. An interview is less about investigating and more about establishing a recorded dialogue. Then the next interview is conducted in a similar fashion, but the branches of the flow are inverted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone who has rehearsed their answers is more likely to be confused by the disorder and likely to flounder, whereas someone who is only speaking the truth would not suffer the same confusion or hesitance.

      Or maybe we could focus on documenting people and not try to harass them. Strangely, I'm more comfortable with a full server hack and wikileaks than I am with confronting people on the street with a camera. Could be my autism, but I don't think we should be walking up to these people.

       We all have different levels of comfort. I would feel most comfortable as an infiltrator because I'm a natural actor, but I just don't have the resources to do it. Best I can do is try and give advice to those with resources and less talent at manipulation. It's ironic that living my whole life questioning the very fabric of existence while being subjected to a constant barrage of conditioning has accumulated into who I am now. I learned manipulation because I saw it take root in those closest to me and was able to watch as an objective observer.

        The DNC wikileak was actually done by infiltration of the DNC. They probably killed the guy responsible, because it is unlikely to beat yourself up, then shoot yourself repeatedly. His wallet wasn't taken. So... that's a possibility.

      I agree.  Staying the exact number of weeks that picture had been posted struck a chord with me.

    Come on guys calm down, breathe, and ask about the protected part of his website, the sudden logo change of Besta Pizza, the motif of the artwork featured throughout his social media, who is dave flinstone, why was your twitter retweeting the allegations at first... that kind of stuff.

     As far as the retweeting of allegation by their own Twitter account. That was likely automated to always retweet if "Comet Pizza" was mentioned in others' tweets for PR. People had mostly good things to say about their pie.

      There is no basement. You all fabricated that from 1 or 2 pictures and made yourselves believe there was a basement.

       Notice the extra ping pong table in the background. Sorry for being inquisitive? Construction like that usually results in permits being issued.

        Obviously it's not a basement as the door is open with natural light coming in. And how are you 100% sure this is comet too? What if he took this at someone else business?

         I don't.. that's why I'd ask. Nobody here is claiming 100% of anything. There are plenty of skeptics here, but we don't shit on everything as we go. These are questions that we have, not assertions.

          You sound pretty convinced there is still a basement even when just about an hour ago James gave a tour of the place to some people that were "protesting" out front. No basment.

           You are literally commenting on my post that acknowledged the twitter video tour.  I also just said in the comment you replied to "Nobody here is claiming 100% of anything". ie: not convinced.

      this is what needs to be asked about imo. that's a known hashtag specific to pedophilia that he used on a photo with a young child in it. I really don't see any way for him to talk his way out of that one as a "joke".

     It is. That's what it's starting to look like to me, atleast. When this all first started there was legitimacy.

     I feel as if this guy kept his mouth shut as long as he needed to clean all evidence in his place. Now all he has to do is take care of the media, and it's working.

     There's no reason to be a dick. They did their best. When you talk bad about your fellow investigators, people who are trying to help, you discourage anons who might want to participate for fear of ridicule, for fear of not doing a perfect job.

     These guys have Alefantis trying to answer questions on camera. The fact that he would even bother answering any of these claims is very telling.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Imagine if you owned a totally legitimate business that was being accused of what he's being accused of. Would you calmly answer questions and try to explain yourself??? No!! You would be fucking LIVID that they were destroying your life and business and welfare! Do you see any outrage in this man? NONE.

       This is a throwaway. The post I made this account to post (https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e8lg7/the_nyt_just_published_an_article_on_pizzagate/daanuow/) addresses this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        EDIT: And because I KNOW this is going to be a point that some individual is going to highlight to dismiss my entire reply, yes my account is new. It's a throwaway. I'm a relatively active redditor otherwise. No offense, but a lot of people are gawking at this because it's curious and interesting, but it's also really embarrassing how a lot of people are conducting themselves here and at least in my case, I don't want to be associated with the nuttiness. I can't even show my friends this place as much as I appreciate the more substantial evidence being uncovered (secret logins, portals with possibly massive files on a pizza website, weird reactions from pizza shops under scrutiny).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sounds harsh, but you can read the rest of that post for more context (although it is long, so I understand if you don't want to but I basically just said this place needs higher standards).

    Yup, just a nice friendly guy. Like Sandusky ... and Gacy ... It's funny, but with all the pics I post, I never posted one with me covered in blood ... or one of a kid duct tapped to the table.

    Does anyone have the full video?
Also how can we archive the video? I tried it but the video doesnt load on archive.is:
http://archive.is/zczLK
   </p>
   <p>
    Also the guys were unprepared and did not ask the important questions because they did not expect to meet Alefantis.

    There is a much better way to go about this, as others have mentioned. With respect and more preparation instead of just yelling out things. Alefantis does look really creepy and did act/say strange things. Take him up on his offer, go inside and take a look around. Better yet, pretend to be a skeptic of all this and go in as a devil's advocate but keep a high attention to detail of anything inside. Evidence of things moved, fresh concrete, paint etc, etc.

    Whoever these guys are, they're fucking idiots.
You guys just asked questions with nothing to back yourselves up and got completely fucked.
Good job asking him about things that he can easily make up excuses for, because even if there is some dark shit behind those pictures, like we assume, his answers do fucking check out and now it's going to be much harder for future interviewers to get anywhere with those questions.
Also, these morons don't even know what a fucking Gyro (Pronounced 'Euro')  is. I audibly fucking kek'd. 
Can we please not let the socially inept be our interrogators? Please? Can we just get someone that actually knows how to discuss, debate, interrogate, and read body language/facial expressions?
Stop going in half-cocked with nothing other than "HEY LOOK AT THIS PICTURE THAT SEEMS EVIL BUT TECHNICALLY CAN HAVE A LEGITIMATE AND NON-EVIL REASONING BEHIND IT".
You fools didn't even have anything to retort with when he gave answers, you simply switched to another picture. Flooding the target with multiple pieces of evidence will get you shallow answers to all of them; Focus on one fucking question, one piece of evidence, and DIG INTO IT DEEP. 
You need to present counter-arguments whenever the subject responds to what you've said and keep it going until you can find a disconnect in their story(ies) or outright catch them in a lie.
These people are not a bunch of fucking amateurs. They're not a bunch of fucking idiots with Periscope accounts and Guy Fawkes masks that post "I'm woke af" all day on their fucking Facebook page.
You might have the right idea in mind, but you have absolutely no ability to follow through on it.
Also a lot of you fucking forget that WE STILL HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT IS ADMISSIBLE IN A COURTROOM. If you want to take this shit we have now and try him, fucking do it. Get a lawyer, call the police, press charges on speculation. Local PD will arrest him and hold him for a night until he pays his bail and give him a court date. That date is where you have your chance to make your argument and show your evidence, and actually try to put him away. Problem is, you have NOTHING SUBSTANTIAL.
I am 100% invested in Pizzagate and the Emails etc and my tinfoil hat is strong, but SPECULATION DOES NOT HOLD UP IN COURT. You are living in a fantasy world. This is not some movie where we can tip off one badass vigilante cop and then the bad guys all get cuffed and we save the day with nothing but our wits, instinct and gut feelings.
This is real fucking life, and the real fucking way to handle all of this is to actually put a case together with hard evidence and take the subject(s) to court where a jury will decide their fate.
Oh did you guys forget that bit? YOU DO NOT DECIDE THE OUTCOME OF THE CASE. Unless they magically pool the whole jury from this sub or /pol/ , we have no legitimate say on whether these people walk free or face jail time.
   </p>
   <p>
    Go ahead and call me a shill and CTR and shit. Go ahead and tell me I'm wrong and that your gut feelings will decide a court battle. Go ahead. I'll fucking relish in it and laugh at you, because most of you are just as fucking bluepilled as the morons that protested in the streets two weeks ago and I find it fucking hilarious.
   </p>
   <p>
    In my heart? I believe the whole pedo ring is legit and want it dissolved and all members arrested or dead.
In my brain? I know we have no fucking evidence to put them away.
   </p>
   <p>
    Oh, and to get the evidence to put them away? You have to actually do physical investigations, not just sit at your fucking computer all day. Go find a piece of clothing from one of them and check it for DNA. Follow them and see if their routine puts them at certain places with certain people, so you can actually make legitimate links instead of speculated ones.
Oh is that too much? Then accept that you're just fucking LARPing for fun and Youtube views/Twitter followers/Likes/Shares.

    These guys have Alefantis trying to answer questions on camera. The fact that he would even bother answering any of these claims is very telling.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Imagine if you owned a totally legitimate business that was being accused of what he's being accused of. Would you calmly answer questions and try to explain yourself??? No!! You would be fucking LIVID that they were destroying your life and business and welfare! Do you see any outrage in this man? NONE.

    You know, if he had said, "you're right, taken out of context, those pictures paint me as creepy as fuck," I'd of second guessed my interpretation of those photos. 
Instead, he goes, "what, it's cute, it's a Jay-Z reference."
   </p>
   <p>
    Confirmation bias run amok, but to me, watching his body language... he looked to me like somebody who was caught doing something, and is very uncomfortable. Now, I'm not saying what that something is (could have been, "I let a baby put money in its mouth, and thought that was funny. What a shitty person am I, and the world knows it" or "SHIT THEY'RE ON TO ME!") I'm not drawing any conclusions from this video.

    This is deplorable. You guys should be ashamed of yourselves. Leave an innocent local business owner alone. It's all fun and games until you're the target of conspiracy theories fueled by fake news. Freedom of speech has its limits and this dude is rich. He will have no trouble suing your asses for slander. And I hope he does.

    Like I said before. This place and that guy have nothing to do with CP. There is absolutely ZERO evidence he is involved in anything. The whole point was to use the leaked emails to find ties between the known pedophiles and the people that they still associate with, then investigate those people. But a pizza place has some images, with no backstory or context, and people think it's proof of cp or some other non-sense. Go look over your own profile pictures as if you were a suspected pedophile, and assume the same things about this place, then go through all of your friends pages and see if there is any weird shit on there, then turn yourself into the FBI for being a pedophile.

     Just checked everyone's Instagram who I work with and I can 100% confirm no art of people performing a "69" on a slice of pizza, a screencap of gay porn with the dick replaced with a slice of pizza, a pic of a new walk in freezer with people tagging #killroom, photos of toddlers eating wads of euros or walls in a "family friendly" establishment with "shut up and fuck" graffiti scrawled all over it.
    </p>

     Cheers for the heads up I was worried for a sec.

      Yea, I checked my friends too, and even some friends of friends. Didn't find anyone posting images of child-related "jokes", overly-sexualized pizza, connections to bands that promote music and imagery that alludes to child rape, torture, etc.

      Alefantis is weird. That doesn't mean he's a pedophile. When people say, "this doesn't prove anything," they don't mean that something isn't fishy. They mean that the information presented as evidence doesn't align with the stated conclusion being drawn about it.

       Agree to some degree but...
      </p>
      <p>
       ...if I was as "weird" lets even say "eccentric" as Alefantis and running a business that was trying to be on the hipster edge, with all the art and private parties hosting bands like "Heavy Breathing" AND with high level political and media ties I would completely distance the WHOLE THING from children &amp; minors, it just raises a LOT of questions.

        It only raises questions if you have some desire to discredit or smear the guy. Consider that, as someone with as many political ties as Alefantis has with prominent Democrats, he's probably got some people that don't like him or would gain by pushing him out of influence or grace with these people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Were these people to exist, they would probably see an ample opportunity to smear this dude by encouraging this shit and leading people to take massive leaps in logic and make heinous assumptions on thin evidence as a justification to harass him. As you can see, it wouldn't even be hard. The mere idea that that is possible should give everyone here pause and maybe encourage people to be more careful in the conclusions they draw.

         Looking at this from a purely business point of view and trying to block out the noise it's still damn disturbing.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's a bit like opening a Pizza shop, that's staffed,owned and frequented by people with both strong views and "niche" interests from the mundane to the macabre (some incredibly provocative if not offensive)...
        </p>
        <p>
         ...and then saying "let's get the kiddies in here!, toddlers, infants...come on families, you'll loveeeee it" and not thinking eventually something like #pizzagate would happen.
        </p>
        <p>
         Something just isn't right about it.

          I don't think this place is featured as the pinnacle of family-friendly establishments. It's not like the kids themselves are following this Instagram, either. It's a place for DC people to unwind, and kids/people with families are welcome. It's advertised as such.
         </p>
         <p>
          It's not Chuck E. Cheese. This is a severe misunderstanding of a different cultural perspective than your own.

     Etc. Etc.   I suppose if there was just one sexual reference accompanied by a picture of a toddler it might be excusable, but we're talking about dozens.   Sorry but it's pretty obvious what's going on here.  If you think this is normal you must have some pretty fucked up friends.

      It's no secret he's gay. If you have ever had gay friends, you would know that sexually, they are much more open. If you're straight, you know that typically, the girls control the brakes, and the guys are on the accelerator. Not always the case, but imagine if you had to accelerators. You'd be on express way to pizza boner pictures from friends. Being gay doesn't make you a pedophile. As for the remainder, I've said worse joking around because I have a dark sense of humor. I'm not easily offended. No joke is off limits.
     </p>
     <p>
      So this guy has years of pictures shared, and the best 'evidence' of him being a pedophile is some captions on pictures, that we don't know the story behind. Then, 20,000 people rush to call him a pedophile, but somehow there is no actual evidence turned up, despite tens of thousands of people looking at his whole life through a magnifying glass.
     </p>
     <p>
      He's also being held accountable for people he has loose affiliations with, which in some cases, finds a way to take the focus off the other person, which is odd because they are much more likely to be pedophiles based on what we have gathered.
     </p>
     <p>
      I think Tony Podesta probably is a pedophile. I can't place the mentality for a 50-60-70 year old man wanting to surround himself with paintings of children in those restraints in some kind of bathroom, the diaper picture and the Dohmer.. thing. He also has a big ass underground 'art' room, and much deeper ties to people that have been convicted or strongly accused of pedophilia.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice, I suspect Tony Podesta, but I don't have proof, so I'm not going to blast his shit everywhere. I would rather try and find solid evidence. Reason is, I'm not a big enough asshole to just call a person I don't know a pedophile without proof.
     </p>
     <p>
      But no one digs anymore. They just eat the puke ideas the previous guy spat up and chuck that out to the next new guy. It's the same shit info going in circles, and everyone thinks they are detectives.
     </p>
     <p>
      This could have been what we needed to actually gather real intel on pedo rings run by high level officials. Now PizzaGate is a bunch of inconsiderate assholes declaring everyone in Washington a pedo and everyone that disagrees a shill.

       I have a dark sense of humor.   It would never occur to me to make dozens of "jokes" about child rape with my friends when they post pictures of kids.   I mean, it could be harmless, and I'm not saying it's been proven that he's a pedophile, but I think the investigation is warranted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other problem is that these "loose affiliations" aren't so loose.   One of the emails to Tony was signed xoxo.   Tony had his birthday party at Comet.   Or look at Amanda Kleinman, who also has a habit of making "jokes" about pedophilia.    I LIKE dark art.   I love horror movies.   This is something very different:

       (stills from one of her music videos).
      </p>
      <p>
       That looks an awful lot like pedophile dog whistling (and sadistic pedophilia at that), not edgy art.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or look at the Luzzatto connection and "the farm."   In one of her advertisements she literally refers to "raw and uncut" "one on one" time with a toddler.

        What I'm saying is the investigation into him is pretty exhausted, and nothing turned up. He has no control of how people sign cards to him, and like I said before, all the evidence against him is really just evidence from other people. You say there is smoke, and we all saw that smoke a long time ago, but thousands of people have looked and didn't find fire. I'm starting to think all the new idiots just make claims because they want there to be something because they are committed to it, but when nothing turned up, they didn't know how to move on, so they started treating this like a team sport rather than an investigation. Cheering for everyone to call him a pedophile rather than investigating and either trying to prove his guilt or innocence. It's just lazy, and worst of all, now tens or hundreds of thousands of people think he's a pedophile, when no one has proven shit. Then, the whole thing gets put on the Right, and this sub has created an easy case to call the Right a bunch of irrational assholes.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you want to call him a pedophile, go prove it first. Getting dumb fucks to agree with you is not evidence, it's being and an asshole. You could get 50% of America to believe you, but that makes no difference to the truth.

         We're not law enforcement.   We don't have the resources or ability to search his home or interview the kids on his instagram.   Unfortunately this stuff appears to go right to the top, so I don't expect a real investigation any time soon.
