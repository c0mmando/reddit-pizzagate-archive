        <strong>So why doesn't everyone here just flash mob these supposedly strange pizza places and look around?</strong>
        <p><p>just started reading all this madness but these places like comet and cult pizza are restaurants anyways right? so it seems to me that all these places that may be secret dens could benefit from a quick couple hundred eyes looking over these places.</p>
<p>you either find something, put the scare in them so they stop/move, draw attention to these places, or find out they are legit.</p>
<p>what is there to lose?</p></p>

        <p><p>Considering the DOJ connection as well as a bit of military folks...the risk is after the mobbing, you have a giant high power spider looking you square in the eye from their nest</p></p>

        <p><p>but couldn't you just like charter a bus and give everyone some stupid matching sports jersey?</p>
<p>its not really out of place for like a traveling bus full of football players to hit up a pizza joint all at once on an away game trip.</p></p>

        <p><p>Because that would be trespassing, and given what we're suggesting they are doing it's a pretty bad idea in the first place.</p>
<p>They're keeping the implicating stuff in private areas anyways.</p>
<p>And lastly, if you want to do this scheduling and organizing it in a public forum is a bad idea.</p></p>

<p>buying pizza at a pizza place is trespassing now?</p>

<p>if everyone wants this to go public then maybe getting super tinfoil about it is not the best idea?</p>
<p>lots of conflicting messages from people here it seems.</p></p>

        <p><p>They have the right to boot you out at their discretion is all I'm saying. This also is not a toothless entity if the connections as outlined are credible.</p>
<p>And if you want to go there don't do anything to mention a specific time in a location where they might be aware of or alerted in advance of you arriving. Be more unpredictable about it.</p></p>

        <p><p>Flash mobs is an incredibly irresponsible idea. The outcome is likely to solidify public backlash against the tinfoil conspiracy theorists. Reason and logic and a lot of circumstantial evidence can be persuasive enough. </p></p>
