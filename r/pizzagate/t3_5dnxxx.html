        <p><p>The concern trolling is out of hand, and this is what it looks like.</p>
<p>The investigation is moving along swimmingly, as more and more connections are being made every day. </p>
<p>Is it moving as fast as everyone would like? Maybe not, but this takes time and work.</p>
<p>So, rather than be a part of the concern trolling problem, just go ahead and start an excel spreadsheet and list every person, place, financial institutions of interest and keep learning about the players behind all of this because it goes straight to the top.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p></p>

        <p><p>Stop derailing the sub. Just screaming "compromised"means nothing. Until the mods either destroy the sub or do something that is counter our goals there is no reason to believe they've been compromised. Until then I'm going to consider anyone doing this a shill and/or a retard 6th grader</p></p>

        <p><p>Not calling PixelBot a disinfo agent but i've contributed to this cause (check my history even if it's only 3 days) so if it's worth anything... I can be 99% sure this sub has not yet been compromised. This does not mean it won't be compromised in the future. Mods have taken measures to prevent this sub from becoming compromised and countermeasures are in place if this sub does look more and more suspicious. But to those of us investigating we do not think this sub has been 100% compromised yet. Please stop spreading disinfo and especially from /u/pixelbot</p></p>

        <p><p>Then who the fuck are all of these other people who have been added to the mod team? I literally just made this new throwaway (now my 4th one) but on my previous 3 throwaways, I had contributed a lot of insight, made many posts making the top page, and had many highly upvoted comments. Never once was I asked about being a mod. So who the fuck are all of these new people? AATA is not the only one - he's just the only one we have some evidence on based on his mod history.</p></p>

        <p><p>And the new tactic, call everyone concern trolls who brings it up. This is literally the same thing that happened in r/wikileaks several weeks ago. It's even the same moderators that were assigned to the takeover of that sub.</p>
<p>The suspicion is that they are there to curb us from getting too close to critical pieces of the investigation. For example, the disappearance of Julian Assange. Myself and many others were trying to piece everything together between his internet being cut, the situation at the air port, the cross Atlantic flight, and how there hasn't been the slightest attempt at a proof of life. This moderator specifically was one of the mods shutting down ANY discussion and deleting the threads. Then when called out, banned us. </p>
<p>I was a regular contributor up until that point and have read tens of thousands of emails personally. This isn't concern trolling, this is a legitimate concern. I want to get to the bottom of this ring more than anything else, but this is a valid issue that needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>I personally witnessed the takeover of r/wikileaks and haven't been back since, on any of my accounts. </p>
<p>I could just as easily call you a troll for doing the same and derailing a thread that is curious about the questionable mod activity, but that gets us nowhere. </p>

        <p><p>FINAL EDIT: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5don4v/attn_addressing_concerns_of_subreddit_compromise/">See this post</a>. I'm now locking this. Thank you everyone.</p>
<p>EDIT UPDATE UPDATE: He has been removed from the mods because of valid concerned about his connections to /r/wikileaks . The mod team here has always been paranoid about the events at Wikileaks and /r/wikileaks. We apologize that we were only recently aware of /u/AssuredlyAThrowaway 's status over there (thanks everyone who brought our attention to this last night). We wanted to address this with /u/pizzathrowaway777 in private. He's come online right now (thankfully) and we've all agreed that the best course of action was to play it safe and demote /u/AssuredlyAThrowaway. Let's ALL HOPE that Wikileaks clarifies all of the concerns the people (including us) have <strong>as soon as possible</strong></p>
<p>EDIT2: We are under a lot of pressure from Reddit admins regarding TOS violations, specifically personal private information. /u/AssuredlyAThrowaway has been VERY helpful with his experience in this regard. We certainly do wish we could benefit from him but we want to exercise every precaution. Including keeping ourselves safe from wikileaks until we know that the organization and DOM can be trusted again.</p>
<p>If you look at the <a href="https://ceddit.com/r/pizzagate/about/log">moderator log</a> you'll see that he hasn't really participated. He is a mod of /r/wikileaks and was made to be a mod 6 weeks ago during the alleged takeover of Wikileaks. All the evidence would show that Wikileaks is in someway compromised, and that /r/wikileaks is in some way compromised.</p>
<p>A couple of us on the mod team here at /r/pizzagate have been made aware of /u/AssuredlyAThrowaway and his connection to /r/wikileaks recently. Of course everyone is right to be concerned that wikileaks is compromised right now.</p>
<p>We cannot address the issue until /u/pizzathrowaway777 comes back online. We were hoping to address the issue of this ONE moderator with him and get /u/AssuredlyAThrowaway demoted or removed (he hasn't been contributing to mod duties anyways, which is fine he looks to be spread quite thing).</p>
<p>So for now, hope that /u/pizzathrowaway777 comes online soon as you've not started the clock! It's just a race between him and /u/AssuredlyAThrowaway (assuming /u/AssuredlyAThrowaway is actually nefarious and not just tainted by his association with the coup over at /r/wikileaks 3 weeks ago). </p></p>

        <p><p>I don't doubt him/her. Check his/her posting history. He/she's a positive influence for Reddit. I'm glad he/she understands the decision and appreciate his/her work for this Reddit. I hope after this mess gets resolved he/she will be re-modded. This is just the best step to take in light of all of these news posts trying to derail positive contribution to the case by claiming this subreddit is compromised.</p></p>

<p>Its a very important subject, and mod teams are inflitrated far easier than one would imagine (hint, hint ; what just went down here).</p></p>

        <p><p>If you have evidence to support your claim, please bring it forward and present it to the entire sub in it's own post, as we all need to see it. We will even sticky it for you. Otherwise you are contributing to division in this subreddit, not working to correct it. Which is exactly why we decided to remove your privileges, it was not meant to be seen as a conviction of guilt, but as a way to quell subversive activities within this sub. </p></p>

        <p><p>Most google results are from sunredditdrama, drama, and topmi dsofreddit ; the very concern trolls who would do anything to undermine the work of a moderator transperency advocate. Go listen to lush future #10 if you want to hear a real interview with me.</p>
<p>Read through the lines.</p></p>

        <p><p>Ive been on this site since it was a three person operation run out of a small apartment in medford mass (I worked at a pizza place where three scraggly looking kids used to come for dinner in Davis square a few times per week.)</p>
<p>Obviously I identified more with the one kid out of the three who really seemed to be an ideological Kantian of sorts, always talking about how we as a society had to engender the free flow of information. A maxim that has stuck with me throughout my life now that I think about it.</p>
<p>Anyway, so I lost touch with those guys after they moved to brooklyn and eventually that kid ended up in a "fired" shirt, lamenting reddit's sale to codne nasty.</p>
<p>So, the years keep coming, and I get older, make new friends, start grad school, become disabled, and end up at home due to that disability; however, through all of that I was still using reddit (albeit under a different handle).</p>
<p>Then, one day, I decided it was a good idea to start a war with alexis and erik martin over their IRL connections to a certain group of mods. When that battle ended, most of my accounts were shadowbanned and I ended up with my current throwaway account.</p>
<p>To that end, I have spent thw last 5 years acting mostly as a moderator transperency advocate; encouraging the use of gol1dfish's tools along with vigilent community oversight as a mechanism to ward off nefarious malfeasance.</p>
<p>Eventually, I uncovered that alexis ohanian had started a PR firm called "antique jetpack" and was consulting for people like startfor. I have been attempting to uncover more about that organization for the past few years.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was asked to mod pizzagate by the top mod, who told me he was new to reddit and wondered if I could assist with helping him protect the subreddit from a potential ban.</p>
<p>As he predicted, we were contacted by the admins about a week later with regards to content on the subreddit, and I was tasked with ensuring we complied with those admin directives in order to aave the sub.</p>
<p>So yea, apologies if this was disjointed im on mobile and its hard to proof read; at the end of the day, Ive been on reddit for a long time, very much value moderator transperency, and have made some enemies as a result. The favorite tactic of those enemies  happens to be sewing discord between myself and communities I moderate. </p>
<p>I suppose I should be used to it after all these years, but it is still frustrating nonetheless to be taken off a mod team due to the malicious actions of a few concern trolls.</p>
<p>Thats reddit I guess though.</p></p>

        <p><p>We've made a huge concession here in my mind. The ridiculous bullshit about this sub being compromised is going to end from here out unless you have proof. If you don't want to be productive then get the fuck out. </p></p>
