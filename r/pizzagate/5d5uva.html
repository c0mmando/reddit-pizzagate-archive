    Excellent Work.  I assume you have screen shot this as well.  Apparently archive was compromised (at least yesterday that was the thought).

     I've had issues with redirects to archive.ec, and page not found when not using https. Changing the url has been useful in my digging.

    Shit, they're across the street from Comet.

    The whole street is implicated. My guess is tunnels.

Time stamped to the tunnels.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      The next case I worked of a major consequence was the McMartin preschool case in Manhattan Beach California. The children there claimed there were tunnels under the school. They were taken into the tunnels and through the tunnels up into the trap door of a bathroom in the triplex next door, placed in automobiles and prostituted in the community.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      These are two three and four year old children before they enter kindergarten. In addition the children claimed that they were flown into the mountains where they were involved with adults in robes. Black robes, chanting, candles. They talked about the brown babies who were sacr- who were cut up. Actually sacrificed. And in checking into this and researching this of course this was obviously a satanic ceremony.

    Am I the only one that doesn't think it is strange that besta and this site would change their logos?  I don't think it's an admission of guilt, as much as acknowledging perception.  They obviously know about the accusations by now.  If you told me my shirt I was wearing indicated in some way that I was a pedophile, I'm changing my shirt, whether or not I'm a Pedo (spoiler alert: I'm not)

     Usually a company that's out of line makes a PR statement or clarification on their website - they stand by their actions and are transparent about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two completely different businesses on the same street with symbols eerily similar to pedophilia is hardly coincidental, maybe if it was one place sure. But TWO places that silently change their pedo logos once caught?
    </p>
    <p>
     Their silence is an admission of guilt. People don't just go out and speak publicly about something people are saying about them online unless someone is hitting a nerve. When someone is crazy, why would you lower yourself to them and clarify yourself if you've nothing to hide?
    </p>
    <p>
     When people do this it is either out of insecurity or guilt, and based on the evidence we have seen of these peoples' interests, gonna go with the ladder. It's the bigger picture.
    </p>
    <p>
     I see so many people saying "this doesn't seem right" and yeah when you look at the small elements of things, sure, it seems innocuous, but these things are grisly on the large scale, when you pull all their bits together.

      I don't know I am kind of torn on that one.  Trying to look at it objectively, I would say that I wouldn't want a PR statement because it draws attention to the fact, and possibly raises awareness.  Tough to be transparent when you don't want to draw attention.
     </p>
     <p>
      My main problem I suppose is that the alleged pedo symbols are so basic and common I could definitively give anyone the benefit of the doubt.  A spiral?  Lines following the borders of the triangle?  Little hands/hearts inside big?  I am not saying these don't exist as real symbols, I know this is from the FBI and they absolutely do, but these seem like things that are so common I could pull thousands of business that resemble one of those designs.  I especially feel the ping pong paddles are a reach.  If they wanted to reflect the butterfly design, seems like it would be much more accurate to use a red and blue paddle design, which is arguably more recognizable as ping pong paddles.
     </p>
     <p>
      But I am definitely not a total skeptic, interested to see where a lot of this info leads.  And dying to have someone search for the tunnels

    The heart symbol seems pretty common but almost all of these are business that have something to do with children.

    A review left on their Trip Advisor account

     "Pizza to Die for"

    . Odd that yet another place on the block serves pizza...Even more odd that their menu does not list Pizza (

    The double hearts were the most obvious pedo symbol out of all of them and yet I felt like there wasn't a lot of follow up on Terasol.

     That's weird. No pizza or Tiramisu on their menu (

      The owner of Terasol wrote
      <a href="http://www.wrmea.org/1994-april-may/midwest-foundation-helps-iranian-children-needing-medical-treatment.html">
       this piece

      in 1994 about providing medical treatment to Iranian Children, who are brought to the United States for treatment. She only wrote two other articles for the same publication, spending most of her time on sales.

    Pardon my ignorance, but what is the significance of this symbol? Is it listed as an known pedophile sign?

     LITERALLY the same thing happened to another FBI verified pedo symbol-bearing pizza shop on the same block (Besta Pizza) right next to Comet Ping Pong last week, as the investigation was heating up.

     Incidentally, Besta means beast in Portuguese. It's probably nothing.

      "Number of the beast."

     <p>
      Beast I.E "Moloch", who demands sacrifice "animal / child", sacrifice also includes but not limited to torture; regardless, they're criminally insane.
     </p>
     <p>
      So beast pizza becomes Moloch Pizza // Moloch Sacrificial Worship Centre.

    Just cause they change their logo after receiving this kind of negative attention from you guys doesn't imply anything sketchy in and of itself. Just sayin

     I believe it does, actually. In fact, it has many implications.

    They must be really stupid criminals if they actually publicly advertise with symbols like that, it would make them soooo easy to identify.

     Criminals love to leave evidence in plain sight for everyone to see, they are just positive that nothing will be done to stop them. Countless serial killers used this method of hiding in plain sight, it has a lot to do with feeling power and ads to the thrill..

     Hardly, the best criminals are the ones who hide in plain site. Incredulity is what they bank on entirely. People like you validate their cover.

     "Why would a pedophile own a pizza place when pizza is a known symbol for pedophilia, that'd be too bold, no one would do that.."
