        <strong>Smuggling / Human Trafficking? Clinton Foundation</strong>
        <p><p>Hey guys- </p>
<p>I stumbled into this link and think there might be some stuff here worth investigating. In the emails cited, they use the codeword "carp", which the author thinks might allude to humans. I mean, who ships multiple shipping containers full of carp? Also, Anthony Weiner is involved, so that sends up a red flag as well.</p>
<p>I have not had the time to really dig into this. I stumbled upon it looking into Clinton Foundation stuff, before pizzagate. But, since no one else seems to have stumbled onto it, and because the preliminary research is already done, it seems worthwhile to pass it along and see if you guys have any ideas.</p>

<p>Its very clear that this is/has been going on for a long time (SWT started in the 1960s) but I cant find any information that directly links the CF to it. It all seems to work on the same premise as tor, hide in a sea of legitimate use.</p>

        <p><p>FBIanon (who was spot on with at least his first two AMAs back in July) was very specific about telling us to keep digging into the Clinton Foundation. A lot of us got sidetracked by pizzagate, but the Foundation deserves equal scrutiny, imo.</p></p>

        <p><p>i had figured sex trafficking and money laundering.  the normal day in day out people just know they are getting $$ from non-profits and corporations and countries.  I'm sure not everyone knows about the trafficking unless that's why that one chick was freaking out and going suicidal.</p></p>

        <p><p>If anyone reading this thinks it has merit and warrants further investigation, please consider posting it to /pol/. I don't 4chan (I'm way too old and the wrong gender) but would love to pass this onto the expert sleuths over there. This has the potential to open a whole new can of worms.</p>
<p>In and of itself, just having a new codeword (carp) gives us a whole other avenue to go down.</p></p>
