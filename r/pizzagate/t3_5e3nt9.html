<p><p>theres hundreds of folks who can attest that people on 4chan used to say "cheese pizza" as a code word for child porn.</p>
<p>was a common thing for years.</p>
<p>i definitely never heard anyone say just "pizza" as a codeword though, it was always cheese/cheesy pizza. </p></p>

<p><p>Confirmed, I've heard "cheese pizza" mentioned  as a code before. </p>
<p>There are too many strange occurrences of the word pizza in relation to this though.   </p>
<p>James Alefantis as a producer in Automatic At Sea. Plot Summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a whim, Eve, a young Swedish traveler, accepts an invitation from Peter to vacation on his family's private island off the coast of New England. As a series of unexpected delays prevent other guests from arriving, Eve discovers that she has little in common with the increasingly erratic Peter. Gradually the idyllic natural beauty of the island gives way and Eve finds herself trapped in a state of surreality punctuated by bizarre visions, dimensional shifting and secret pizza.</p>

<p><p>I saw mentioned in another thread that speculated 'cheese pizza' = child porn and 'secret pizza' = snuff porn. </p>
<p>May not be too. </p></p>

<p><p>Anecdotally, I agree with Cheese Pizza (because it shares the letters of Child Porn) being known code for years.  One of the first warnings you would read about before going on the dark web years ago was to avoid places advertising Cheese Pizza or Lollies (Lolitas).  </p>
<p>Never heard anything about the stand alone pizza or the pizza coded according to the FBI emails but it stands to reason.  </p>
<p>Here is an important distinction I would like to point out:  I don't think Cheese pizza was ever a code word.  I think it was a logical substitution.  Meaning, they weren't trying to hide the fact it was actually Child Porn to unknowing eyes, it was just to avoid trigger filters for investigation.  I don't really think there was any plausible deniability at play like most code words, there was no doubting the fact that you were looking for Child Porn.  </p>
<p>I lasted all of 10 minutes browsing the darknet.  I was picturing hitmen, and red rooms, and fedex drugs, nope I tried clicking "normal" looking porn links and saw CP one of my first clicks.  Haven't been back on since.  Saw all I needed to see and Noped outta there</p></p>

<p><p>Seriously? Any two words the first one with a c the second with a p. There are way more than the pizza one. Been like that for decades.</p></p>
