    Turkey Hill is now the owner of the abandoned property. Kroger which is a huge supermarket chain with most of its locations being on the South and East coast of the United States owns Turkey Hill. Kroger has many shareholders to list as co-owners but the biggest shareholder they have is Capital Research and Management Company. The CEO and Chairman, as well as Principal Financial Officer for Capital Group / Capital Research and Management Company is Timothy D. Armour. PAC and Lobbyist. Gives a little money from alot of different places. Need to know here is he has contributed to Clinton Group and Bill and Hillary Airport. Theres alot more. Seems to make small contributions but from both his company to the company he operates. Heres some screenshots.

     The murder was in a few different articles. If I was able to find a little more info on it I would have added more.

    Wanted to add in retail chains could easily be involved in trafficking children because they are always having trucking arriving/departing. Also there have been obviously suspicious things going on with different Walmart locations being closed for no reason at all/suspicious construction.
   </p>
   <p>
    People speculated before that it was related more to trafficking all humans during martial law, but with the underground work being done it could also be trafficking children currently

     Nobody is going to inspect any freight containers or trailers labeled Kroger or Walmart either.

      They spent a ton of money on infrastructure there. No reason for that trucking company to look somewhat abandoned too. But, again this links 2 pizza shops to Kleinman and Clintons. Itll keep getting wild. Idk if worth exploring further but this Timothy D Armour guy has very little to find online. Except an open letter from his ex-wifes company letting the world know that she got royally shafted in divorce court and is still getting 8 figure salary. Hes hiding a ton of earnings too. Might be wealthier than Trump if also a trillionaire as one article mentioned.

     Automation would certainly disrupt that paradigm. Maybe they're coming up alternative with ways to haul cargo since trucks aren't going to be as convenient/efficient soon.

     Theory seems likely.
