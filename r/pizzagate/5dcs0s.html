    If we find some bombshells we can post them on /r/the_donald
   </p>

    we dont need shills and derailing people. I think all who are invested are already in.
   </p>
   <p>
    we still can ask for vouchers.

   <p>
    i dont want this to become /pol/ nothing productive will come if we grow to big.
   </p>
   <p>
    We dont want to become a meme site.

    People are primarily learning about this by accessing this sub. It needs to be a full blown movement, not just a subreddit. Since we're going to get nothing from mainstream media and probably nothing from agencies who should be doing this job the only thing we really have is being too loud to ignore.

    Because /r/the_donald isn't a meme-driven subreddit (ala the circlejerk that is /r/murica) as much as it is a serious one? Don't get me wrong, that place is both informative and serves comedic relief, but you can't be serious..
   </p>
   <p>
    The moderators and dedicated posters are working very hard to keep the shills, derailers, and sabateurs out of the picture.
   </p>
   <p>
    This will never be a meme site.

      Try and tell them about it, get them involved. Anyone impacted by child abuse definitely has the platform to advocate our search.

    You could always start a discord and invite the people who are focused on investigating, good way to filter out noise. And if you invited a shill or some one acting shady you can just kick them
