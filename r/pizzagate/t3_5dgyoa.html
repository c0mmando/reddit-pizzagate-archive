<p>Most pages are talking about Iraq/Afghanistan, Extraordinary renditions etc.</p>

<p><p>It has the coordinates of every single US military installation, including black sites on it.</p>
<p>So, it may be DISTRACTING. But, I think it was a sincere effort to impart knowledge and it has information as recent as last month.</p>

<p><p>You touched on something important here. I believe this page is setup to take advantage of the page you mentioned http://phonograph.lhohq.info/addentry.php. This page utilizes a service/script called 'chipmunk guestbook'. If you post something here, it will add an entry to this page http://phonograph.lhohq.info/. </p>
<p>Chipmunk Guestbook is pretty vulnerable to SQL injection <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-2839/product_id-6041/Chipmunk-Scripts-Chipmunk-Guestbook.html">(See CVE site here)</a>. From the CVE site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chipmunk Scripts Guestbook allows remote attackers to obtain the installation path of the script via a URL that causes an error message to be displayed, such as a URL that contains a single quote (') in the start parameter of index.php.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can even see botched attempts on the entry page http://phonograph.lhohq.info/. If you look at the top of the page you'll see </p>
<pre><code>Warning: session_start() [function.session-start]: open(/home/content/71/9972971/tmp/sess_uvr85q9rrtftm7gtfpt5r9ifp0, O_RDWR) failed: No such file or directory (2) in /home/content/71/9972971/html/lhohq_subdomains/phonograph/index.php on line 2

<p>My Theory is that this site is used as a hub of some sort to upload intentionally shitty web pages via SQL injection. The info is probably real (until 4chan figures out the SQL injection). It's used as an untraceable source so it can't be taken down like pastebin, github etc. </p>
<p>It's a very basic site, no JavaScript or jQuery. Just an apache server for PHP. Here's the builtwith page https://builtwith.com/lhohq.info. </p>
<p>Lastly, if you go to this page http://www.lhohq.info/container/sudanese-error-strike-africom/libor-swift-gchq-parliament-echelon-five-eyes-xkeyscore-query.html, There is a statement from anonymous or some such organization. Just view source or inspect the nodes to see it. Here's the pastebin link. I couldn't figure out the pastebin embed. http://pastebin.com/raw/x68k2UfV </p>
<p>*edit: This story broke in 2012 https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/09/04/apple-device-id-hack/</p>
<p>There's a statement in there about data: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: We like beer and the use of manipulated bacterial ADN to transmit encrypted data. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you google that you get a few results: This one is most interesting https://twitter.com/ovnicraft/status/242968239414603776  but I don't have any more time right now. I'll pick this up later.</p></p>

<p><p>Looks like instructions/commentary about using a window manager for virtual machines. http://fvwm.org/ specifically. Virtual machines are often used for privacy or nefarious reasons. Can also be used for DDOS attacks. This frankly sounds like a forum post. There are random words thrown in, misspellings, deleted words, punctuation errors, etc. http://fvwmforums.org/phpBB3/</p>
<p>Downloading for candy means downloading the list of iphone users and their data from the links provided.</p>

HOW TO GET THE CANDY ONCE YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED THE FILE

first check the file MD5:
e7d0984f7bb632ee19d8dda1337e9fba

(lol yes, a "1337" there for the lulz, God is in the detail)

then decrypt the file using openssl:
openssl aes-256-cbc -d -a -in file.txt -out decryptedfile.tar.gz

password is:
antis3cs5clockTea#579d8c28d34af73fea4354f5386a06a6

then uncompress:
tar -xvzf decryptedfile.tar.gz

and then check file integrity using the MD5 included in the password u used to
decrypt before:
579d8c28d34af73fea4354f5386a06a6
^ yeah that one.

if everything looks fine
then perhaps it is.

enjoy it!

<p><p>In one of those pages, there is a hidden letter written from Elvis to Agnew. It seems that the letter was Elvis asking to get a spot in intelligence or something to 'help the country' from the hippies and drugs. Apparently they were ok pals.

<p><p>Idk it may be. I remember someone saying this was/is all/partially a guccifer leak. </p>
<p>I'm looking for what was said. Wtf what if it's guccifer's website? Why have so many of these pedo trails lead to Russian/Serb/Marina Abramovic types? Did you read his letter? Holy shit.</p></p>

<p><p>Exactly, I've seen those as well. I've even seen the video of how to hide images in sounds using an algorithm. I'm starting to wonder if Marina has a connection to Guccifer.</p>
<p>Could that contact list be from Guccifer hacking into Marina, whom was connected with all of those "elites?"</p>
<p>We need to start referencing the list from LHOHQ to Marina's guest lists.</p></p>

<p>I don't know shit about computers, but I know when I try to copy paste things, sometimes it screws up the format and makes an unreadable, babble wall of text. Could the ramblings in LHOHQ be a result of copy+paste errors?</p></p>

<p><p>"Domains by Proxy" is a service that makes your information hidden in the WHOIS directory. Anyone that looks up your domain's WHOIS sees stuff such as "Registration Private" and "Domains By Proxy, LLC" instead of your real information. The scammers listed on that thread used the same service. Sadly, lhohq's WHOIS doesn't have any information relating to the real owner at all.</p></p>

<p><p>It's an older MS program, apparently for conducting computer searches and then securely storing all the information. Like an easy way to make a fast data dump. Many of the images and the text was taken directly from http://cipha.net/special/cofee_user_guide_v112.pdf</p></p>

<p><p>Inspecting the elements of http://www.lhohq.info/libor-report/financial-security-and-national-security.html</p>
<p>I found a lengthy report about historic FBI wire taps and "spike-mikes".</p>
<p>I haven't read it all line by line because it's a wall of text, but if anyone just inspects the element maybe you can read it more. Strange. This seems like someone's college thesis on wiretaps.</p></p>

<p><p>There are hundreds of articles like this. They mostly focus on Iraqi/Afghan wars, extraordinary renditions, aliens, smuggling, etc. This person was deep into government fuckery. I wonder if they stumbled upon the pedo ring and were stopped...</p></p>

<p><p>Someone was talking about that last night. Many many many of the pictures are originals, which raises even more questions.</p>
<p>It seems like most of the suspected pedo folks are working with kids, charities, humanitarian stuff for a cover. It's just like the Clinton campaign was run. Make yourself look good and accuse your opponent of everything you do.</p></p>

<p><p>So apparently there's an active forum on this site?</p>
<p>The recent posts are well... I'm starting to think this site was made to troll us. Just have a look for yourself. WTF?</p>
<p>The following are recent posts:</p>

<p><p>If you go to LHOHQ.info and click contact, you come to the page that posts messages. http://phonograph.lhohq.info/ is where, if you have broken in, you can post messages.</p>
<p>If you check the dates and contents of the messages, people have known about this site for years and messed around with it. The site has existed in it's current form since at least 2007 and updated regularly since then. The style of the site and most of it's contents suggest it was created much earlier than 2007. The site resembles many sites that were unearthed from links in LHOHQ, most from the 90's. We've suggested amongst each other that the designer of many of the other sites is the same designer as this, and possibly the same designer as such sites as Drpong.net, cometpizza, etc. Definitely not a troll, per se.</p>
<p>Still an unknown creator, but links have been made to Milwaukee via posts in the early 2000's that talk about an "ancient Egyptian cobra" symbol with the letters LHOHQ that was found at 330 Kilburn in Milwaukee. The building is Tishman Speyer, Tishman was the builder of 666 5th ave, 1 World Trade Center, some Disney buildings, to name a few. About as satanic as you can get IMO.</p>
<p>Has yet to be determined a troll. </p></p>

<p><p>Interesting. All of the places to go and she found this place.</p>
<p>What if it's created by her alternate personality or something? It seems everyone involved with this, especially the women, seem to have alternate personalities that were abused.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm not following the logic here. The registrar of both ihohq.info and Marina Abramovic's website are Wild West Domains (one of the worlds biggest registrars) therefore Abramovic operates ihohq.info?</p></p>

<p><p>Maybe you should dig and look for truth before you discredit. There are HUNDREDS of pages with HUNDREDS of links with relevant info to this investigation, including children, murder/sex, pizza, etc. Too strange to be nothing. This is something.</p></p>
