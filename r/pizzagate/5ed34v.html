    I think if trump was fully involved, then the whole system wouldnt be working so hard against him.  Also, I think if he were involved, they would have leaked a death blow unto him and bagged him up before he could retaliate.  I dont think trump is 100% clean, but i wouldnt categorize him there with epstein based on the limited information that we have.

       I imagine a billionaire would be a lot of fun to hang out with, let alone when you put two billionaires together.  And of course, they will hang with younger women.  But there isnt anything in that quote that is incriminating, really.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again- I dont think Trump is an angel - but.. let's just say that I don't think he is running a 'pizza shop', either.

         I don't think they are friends.  I think Trump says things to gain advantage.  He has proven so time and time again.

     As interesting as that post was, it's still just an anonymous post on 4chan. There is a lot of circumstantial evidence that shows Trump and Epstein knew each other well.
    </p>
    <p>
     I suggest you read this profile of Epstein in NY mag from before he got caught. 
http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/
    </p>
    <p>
     "Epstein likes to tell people that he's a loner, a man who's never touched alcohol or drugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. "I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,'' Trump booms from a speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life."
    </p>
    <p>
     But beautiful women are only a part of it. Because here's the thing about Epstein: As some collect butterflies, he collects beautiful minds. "I invest in people -- be it politics or science. It's what I do," he has said to friends. And his latest prize addition is the former president. In his eyes, Clinton as a species represents the highest evolutionary form of the political animal. To be up close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to seeing the rarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa, "If you were a boxer at the downtown gymnasium at 14th Street and Mike Tyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign leaders had when Clinton entered the room. He is the world's greatest politician."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science," Clinton says through a spokesman. "I especially appreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work on democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service, and combating HIV/AIDS.""

    The only thing i see that remotely makes me curious is the comment about Trump and Epstein both liking young women. But we already knew both did.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not much else makes it seem like he is involved. The connection with Greenberg kind of explains itself. Bear had a boom in the 80s and 90s, the time Trump was becoming a household name, and he was Trumps stock broker.

     Read the NY mag article. Epstein was quite close to Greenberg. Greenberg attended Trump's wedding; he was Trump's personal stockbroker. Yes, this doesn't really mean much, but it shows how tight the social circle is. Trump, the Clintons and Epstein were so much closer than they now acknowledge. I'm not saying this is proof of anything specific, but it scares the shit out of me that both candidates for president were tied up in all this, and this was before the pizzagate thing really exploded.

     Trump didn't say he liked young women.  He said that he and Jeffrey both like "beautiful women".  And that some of the ones Jeffery likes are "on the younger side".

    Someone has to tangle with the "dark side" a bit to gain trust, then gather information... and strike when its the right time.

     The same way that Obama convinced millions of young people that he was going to change the system: lie, pretend, act. He's about as close to the system as you can get.

    Trump was friends with Jeffrey Epstein for over 20 years before he was charged with soliciting a minor for sex, a minor charge given that the dude literally has a plane called the Lolita Express. Trump had 14 contacts in Jeffrey Epstein's little black book... they spent time together in Florida, as both Trump and Epstein had property in Palm Beach florida, where Epstein was convicted. Trump was also pals with Bill Clinton for all of this, a confirmed creep and even before pizzagate probably a confirmed pedo. Don't buy the mythology of Trump; he's just as dirty as everyone else. He's part of the Globalist conspiracy, it's just that his role is to pretend that he isn't. But Trump has been an insider for decades. His personal stockbroker in the 80's was Alan Greenberg, the man who got Jeffrey Epstein a job at Bear Stearns.
   </p>
   <p>
    Trump clearly knew what Epstein was about, as evidenced by his statement in the NY mag article I've referenced in the picture (ref. 4), and knew that Clinton was involved with him. Why didn't he use this in the campaign? Probably because there's a lawsuit filed against him related to rape at one of Jeffrey Epstein's sex parties. True or not, Trump absolutely is aware of these dealings, and I imagine he is just as involved as anyone else. Would YOU be friends with Jeffrey Epstein for 20 years if you know he had an affinity for young girls?

     Lol you're so fucking paranoid. Why would he pretend to be non-NWO when 99% of the population doesn't believe in the NWO theory? Why would all the globalists and everyone be opposed to him so badly? Why is he picking nationalists for his team? Your theory makes no sense at all. Take a chill pill

      He told supporters that he was going to destroy the establishment, but his real job is to maintain the establishment. I think the original plan was to have Hillary win, but Wikileaks made her too unpopular to have it be believable. Trump won because he was allowed to win.
     </p>
     <p>
      It's not paranoia to think that Trump is part of the establishment lol.

        Because his objective isn't to defeat Trump, but to create divisions between the people. Classic divide and conquer. Maybe Soros in particular isn't thrilled that Trump won, but most of the establishment is probably not that concerned. Hillary was the safer option, but Trump isn't going to reform Wall St or stop the War industry. He just said he's not going to prosecute Hillary! He's backpedaling on just about everything, and he's not even in office yet. He lied to you and you're still in denial.

        You think Trump is going to regulate the banks? Give me a break. The only real candidate who was going to challenge the establishment was Bernie. If the Elites weren't okay with Trump, he wouldn't have won. Call me paranoid, but I don't think it's unreasonable given what we've seen this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trust me, I believe that the establishment mostly wanted Hillary, but they're not unsatisfied with Trump. He's going to appoint Wall Street execs to his cabinet and maintain the status quo.

          Yeah, Bernie did sell out, but he only did so under the kind of pressure that the Clintons put on people. I would not be surprised if he was threatened. Even so, just the fear of Trump was probably enough for him.
         </p>
         <p>
          However, his candidacy represented a challenge to the ruling class. Trump isn't going to tax the rich lol. Bernie wanted to break up the banks. Do you think Trump is going to do that?

       Nwo would want to own both sides to have a rigged election, but wasnt that jeb? Maybe Trump is just involved enough to have realized he wanted to end it? Not much we can do about it now

      This guy is just desperate and trying to muddy the waters. They want this shut down. Ignore them. I have been doing my part but in lurker mode. We are not alone on wanting the truth. Going back to lurking in 1..... 2....3....

    In order to join the elites and have a chance at defeating them, you must be in their club.

   <p>
    OR

    He's also involved and the only way we can truly defeat the establishment and their horrors is by full on revolt.
