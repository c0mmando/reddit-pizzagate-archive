    Focus on "Big Cheese LLC" companies and "Big cheese" as a phrase
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I found this a while ago and need help on researching variations of Big Cheese LLC, and "big cheese" as a phrase. This is obviously being used in a specific context. Many of these "Big Cheese LLC" companies focus on children or have odd things we've come to recognize in other pizza places (that are operating suspiciously)
   </p>
   <p>
    Summary of some of the things I've found:
   </p>
   <p>
    Suspicious Companies
STADZ BIG CHEESE LLC
Registered to David A Stadler in 2016.
5488 Carroll Northern Rd,
Carroll, OH 43112
Address is rural home, last sold in 2011.
Sold to Antoinette Coakley by David A Stadler in 2011.
Why did he register a business in 2016 to a property he sold in 2011? (he transfered ownership to his wife)
   </p>
   <p>
    Sources:
Company info- https://www.lookupbear.com/us/oh/carroll/business-misc/stadz-big-cheese-llc
Zillow info- http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/5488-Carroll-Northern-Rd-Carroll-OH-43112/33791557_zpid/
County info on property sales- http://realestate.co.fairfield.oh.us/Data.aspx?ParcelID=0130011410
No actual info on the business at all.
Info on Antoinette Coakley, she works/worked for Bloom-Carroll Local in Ohio (clerical position)
Bloom-Carroll local actually for the school district. Tried Antoinette Stadler thinking maybe these two married, and it worked.
This document of the school meeting minutes shows Antoinette Stadler as Administrative Assistant of the Transportation Department. She’s also listed on the school website, with “Toni” as her nickname. (common for Antoinette)
https://www.bloom-carroll.k12.oh.us/district/Personnel-Directory.html
Deadend on Antoinette involvement.
David Stadler (unsure if same) is listed as Chairperson of South African Venture Capital Association. “Founding Principal and Chief Executive Officer at Paean Private Equity”
   </p>
   <p>
    I found this rape case in 2012:
http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca6/10-1245/10-1245-2012-06-05.html
Possibly he sold his house to the wife because of the upcoming court trial. Case involves stalking and rape.
Dead end here, unsure whether he is both a past Chairperson and convicted rapist, or only one of them. Regardless, still no actual business or even webpage connected to it. If not the criminal, could have married woman connected to school for trafficking purposes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Big Cheese Photo LLC
“here is "big cheese photo" owned by Big Cheese Photo LLC, which features photo sections such as "busy girls" (girls out and about), "almost free" (high school girls almost graduated?!), "double trouble" (twins?), "nucleus" (babies). The names and simple layout is oddly strange. This is just red flag central. http://www.bigcheesephoto.com/ “
   </p>
   <p>
    “Big Cheese Photo LLC is registered to Alex S Keam, spouse to Mark Keam, who served on Hillary's Asian American and Pacific Islander council. Both are located in Virginia.” https://trademarks.justia.com/856/47/big-cheese-85647909.html
https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/statements/2016/01/13/aapi-leadership-council/
   </p>
   <p>
    This is owned by Alex S Keam, who is listed online as spouse of Mark S Keam. Mark Keam is a member of Hillary’s Asian American and Pacific Islander council. The website has really odd “stock” photos in folders listed things such as PG-13, nucleus, waistline, dog breath, and sprouts. Most of the albums have weird descriptions involving kids. There are some that are obviously provactive, overall theme is suggestive. Looks more like a collection of personal photos not stock photos for marketing. Titles like “our home” and “my office” reinforces that. Could be a front for advertising the children they have, or the $650 price tag could be for gross photos of the people photographed in the folder. Worth noting that the pool party folder had a photo of an Asian girl without her top. Wouldn’t check that folder out, the photos are just weird.
   </p>
   <p>
    Politics and Prose (Not Big Cheese related but noticed this while on their site)
Politics and Prose is already connected to this but I want to point out that it’s also affiliated with the Little Red Fox business nearby. This is seen in an article announcing it, and in the logo. The logo of “The Den” (basement cafe of P&amp;P) has the same fox that’s illustrated in the LRF cafe logo. On the P&amp;P website, there is a strangely worded page for a once a month book delivery. 
“Book-a-Month Subscription

We carefully handpick each book based on the reader’s interests and hobbies, and favorite books and writers.

   </p>
   <p>

   </p>
   <p>
    We send books to readers of all ages! Visit our Children and Teens Department to enroll your favorite young person.”
This might seem normal on the surface but pay attention to some of the language. Book could easily mean child. And “favorite young person” just sounds odd, plain and simple.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hope and Healing Place
Hope and Healing Place held a "The Big Cheese Event." On their page, Sponsor a Child page has the pedophilia imagery in it, plus you can pay to put a child through different camps? Their logo looks like the Two hearts, the sun is a swirl. I know it might be a stretch but the term Big Cheese is definitely a double meaning. The fact that many different pages/businesses connected with “Big Cheese LLC” companies or “big cheese” are child-centered is a sign.
http://www.hopeandhealingplace.org/sponsor-a-child.html
Possible this is a clean business, but work digging just in case something I missed.
   </p>
   <p>
    "The Big Cheese Food Truck" The Big Cheese, LLC
Does private catering but visually looks similar to “Big Cheese Photo LLC” webpage. In fact all of these websites are pretty much orange-ish yellow and red themed. Pizza themed? Even Hope and Healing Place’s logo.
Owned by “The Big Cheese, LLC” which is owned by Stephen A Garcia. “Mr. Stephen A. Garcia, also known as Steve, serves as the Chief Financial Officer of Universal Broadband Communications Inc.”
http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=3126224&amp;privcapId=330525
Why would he own this? Looking further to track down specific owner. Apparently this company is listed as a chain restaurant however obviously no restaurant exists at the address listed.
10150 Dorchester Rd # 223
Summerville, South Carolina 29485-8536
United States
http://listings.findthecompany.com/l/17549174/The-Big-Cheese-LLC-in-Summerville-SC
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit:
Adding "The Big Cheese" in Arizona. Now closed but one review on Yelp says:
"It took 15 minutes to order because the manager we busy flirting with minors. Games are a minimum dollar which would of been fine if I could have given my baby girl a toy with the tickets she won, ohhh wait...yep manager still chatting. Nothing makes me happier than old food, dirty restaurants, perverted managers, and telling my baby she can't have a toy worth pennies after spending $20 on adult sized games."
Another customer is suspicious of the owner:
"Let me just start with this place is a horrible environment. I ask to speak to the boss (didn't catch his name) he by far is the "phoniest"  person i have ever met. I wanted to look at the jerseys he has for sale in his restaurant, which i might add are counterfeit, poorest quality jersey I had seen. I hope the cops go in there one day and see those... I think someone needs to go in there and check this guy out."
Looks like in 2010 new management took over. Originally registered to Bret Fishback
   </p>
   <p>
    "Edit: Found this info
The Registered Agent on file for the Big Cheese LLC company Comet Pizza is registered under, is Robert A Harris IV and is located at 4834 Sedgwick St Nw, Washington, District Of Columbia 20016. Robert A Harris is an attorney in VA that mostly represents businesses. Why would he register the company? Am I misunderstanding something here? Why would an attorney own Big Cheese LLC, the company that Comet Pizza operates under?"

    This is interesting for sure... I think there is likely to be a glut of non-suspicious business because "big cheese" is a common slang for boss or successful businessperson... however, bigcheesephoto.com sounds quite suspicious based on your description. I'm going to check it out when on desktop.

      I believe that is just who registered the company but doesn't mean that is the owner.
     </p>
     <p>
      What Is a Registered Agent?
     </p>
     <p>
      A registered agent is a responsible third-party who is registered in the same state in which a business entity was established and who is designated to receive service of process notices, correspondence from the Secretary of State, and other official government notifications, usually tax forms and notice of lawsuits, on behalf of the corporation or LLC.

       Good point. Another thing listing company info simply says "Comet Pizza". Some of the other companies list the actual owner, this one just lists Comet Pizza.

       </p>
       <p>
        Pie Five Pizza Co., a subsidiary of Pizza Inn Holdings Inc, has awarded franchise rights to two veteran restaurant 
groups that will introduce the brand to three new states. Big Cheese LLC, owned by Jim Stevens, is contracted to 
open seven restaurants in Wichita, Kan., and Tulsa, Okla. Simmonds Restaurant Management will open six Pie Five 
locations in Omaha and Lincoln, Neb.
       </p>
       <p>
        "As we expand across the country, word is getting out that Pie Five Pizza is a well-positioned concept with huge 
potential," said Madison Jobe, chief development officer for Pie Five. "It speaks volumes that proven, seasoned 
operators like Jim Stevens and Mike Simmonds have hitched their wagons to our brand. With partners like them, the 
sky's the limit for Pie Five."

        "Stevens grew up in the restaurant business and has been involved with many concepts. Currently he is an Applebee's
franchisee with 25 locations in Kansas and Omaha. He also franchises seven Jason's Delis in the Kansas City, Mo., 
area."
       </p>
       <p>
        "After graduating from Arizona State University, Brian Stevens said his father persuaded him to work in the 
Applebee's restaurants to learn the business. The two came across the Jason's deli concept in Wichita and soon 
bought the franchise rights to the Kansas City area."

    I know this might sound silly but in the show Samurai Pizza Cats,
cats with mechanized suits deliver pizza's, and the main villain of the show is a mouse called 'Big Cheese'
   </p>
   <p>
    Its a children's TV show revolving around pizza and 'Big Cheese' is the villain
   </p>
   <p>
    Either nothing or a subtle nod
