        <strong>are building/construction permits public record?</strong>
        <p><p>i'm thinking about the tunnels/holes in the basement. surely this is the kind of work that would require some type of permit, right?</p>
<p>i don't know what this information could help with, but it could give us a date for when they started it, or it could tell us what the construction was supposed to be for.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes but it's tedious to find them.  You can start by calling the local planning and zoning boards for each location.  They save the plans for tax/square footage purposes. </p></p>

        <p><p>They are public record, but most municipalities/counties don't put them on the internet because people don't usually care about them. You need to go the planning commission office in the courthouse and view them in person.</p></p>

        <p><p>I did read ALefantis stating it took 18 months to renovate the building. Seems like a long time and the place is pretty shoddy looking still.
They had h&amp;s inspections in Aug (probably can access them via DC.gov website) where there was no mention of a walk-in cooler as posted on his IG.</p></p>
