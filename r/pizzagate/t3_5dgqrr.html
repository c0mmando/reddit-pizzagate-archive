        <p><p>I can't figure out why he even let her visit him. And he actually ate the food she gave him. What was he thinking? If I was in his position, a celebrity from the US would be the last person I'd welcome.</p></p>

        <p><p>Sticking your dick in Pam Anderson is the same as main-lining the contents of a petri dish of Hepatitis. She nasty.</p>
<p>I think it's strange (not really) that we're seeing some more fringe but still mainstream media (dailymail, for example) talking about Assange, but ONLY in the context of Pam Anderon's visit and conspiracies.</p>
<p>They're already trying to make it look crazy. See what's happening?</p></p>

        <p><p>They have known each other for a couple of years - introduced by Vivienne Westwood. Viv was visiting him every month - the last two months it has been Pam. It appears Pam is taking over the visits from Viv. Not sure though. Vivienne is good friends with J. I keep hoping she will say something, anything.</p></p>

        <p><p>Compared to other celebrities sure.</p>
<p>Pamela Andersson too has seen better days. The tattoo off barbed wire on her arm doesn't help.</p>
<p>Having said that, if they showed showed me any interested I would be a happy boy. They are attractive compared to my ugly ass. </p>
<p><strong>A better question is - did they case the joint for a hit?</strong></p>
<p>Not knowingly but all intel is useful I guess. </p></p>

        <p><p>It's about normalizing taboo behavior.  It's not that much different than grooming children except this how you recruit adults.  Most people are just there for a weird party.  It's the few people that <em>get into it</em> that they are attracting into their group.  It's the same thing with Tony Podesta's pizza parties and his frequent pizza after-parties.  It's about creating filters to protect the <em>real</em> parties.</p></p>

        <p><p>It is a mock occult ritual, the fact that they do it in private leads me to question what they do at those ceremonies. They are hiding in plain sight. Sure, there are people in Hollywood involved, but many of them there are not a part, if any. </p></p>

        <p><p>Correct. Apparently they are like every bdsm themed goth club from the early eighties, adjusted for 2016 inflation.  It used to be that all you needed for creds was a few razor scars on the wrists. Now you have to simulate Crowley Cookery and baby raping. Tsk tsk, baby boomers ain't what they used ta be</p></p>

        <p><p>Spoken like someone who's never interacted with metal subculture. They're different, but generally super nice people. The most nefarious thing they're doing are a weekend of drugs and wild sex before work on Monday. The imagery is celebrated because it does have an outsider appeal, and it keeps out the sheep. </p></p>

        <p><p>I still don't get it, and fail to see how it isn't just discrimination on the basis of taste/preference. <br>
Whether it's taste in music or the symbolism of it - embracing a certain symbolism is still an aesthetic choice, that doesn't say much about how qualified you are in other works of life. </p></p>

        <p><p>Exactly my thoughts. I dont think its to crazy that you get attracted to the most unusual things at the point where you can get everything you want. And its definitly not a reason to run around and involve satanism in this whole thing (not to mention that this has nothing to do with satanism).</p></p>

        <p><p>Make sure you mention to everyone that you admitted to viewing cheese pizza in another sub when the mods called you on it. You've been trying to derail everything since day one. I merely have someone spiritual support when being faced with such vile evils that just knowing can harm your mental state. Who else should 've gave faith in? The chans? The donald? You?</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree.</p>
<p>It is good to take notes of things like this that are connected to the people we are looking into, but it doesn't mean they are pedos or everyone involved is.</p>
<p>A lot of people, myself included, are into dark and weird things, probably a lot weirder than anything in this album. </p></p>

        <p><p>This spirit cooking fixation is a deadend. Could it connect people together? Perhaps. But the exhibition in and of itself is nonsense. Do we really think all these celebrities are OK with being photographed publicly at some occult ritual?</p></p>

<p>Woe to her</p>
<p>Edit. 
You are here because you value truth and justice. You see the evil that opposes everything good and right. All the secrets are being revealed.  I don't want to jump the gun but, I think you have been recruited into the heavenly creators army my friend. I don't know you and I don't know how you will receive this message but, I just feel like I need to tell you all this. Don't ever give up faith in YHWH. his love, justice and truth is clearing the way for the reign of yeshua but things are going to get worse before they get better. Don't be stumbled or have anxiety!!</p></p>

        <p><p>Pedophiles gravitate towards positions of authority and trust so they can get away with diddling kids.

        <p><p>Actually it does. Abromovic has held "art performances" at comet before. Private of course. And tying the west coast side of their logistics is important also. Hollywood has always been tainted. Another finger in the same hand. This is worldwide and tying the lose ends might crack this case open. Just a thought</p></p>

        <p><p>I just personally found it strange that the body mutilations happened to be on the female genitalia first. It's bedazzled with rhinestones/diamonds then, cut out like a pizza. Young naked people laying on tables. Shared with the elite. I personally feel like this is just one of their rituals (took place in November).There were more pictures on Zimbio. </p></p>

        <p><p>Hollywood being tied to the occult has been widely discussed for years; people just usually laughed it off as conspiracy stuff. </p>
<p>A quick run through You-Tube on Beyonce, Lady Gaga, Kesha etc. music videos shows how pervasive the occult symbolism and imagery is in the music business. Ex: run this town</p>
<p>Google miley cyrus pizza instagram, or katy perry pizza for example, or occult imagery </p>
<p>All these people are either weirdly obsessed with pizza or they are all part of the same machine.</p></p>

        <p><p>Honestly, they could hold these more "innocent" faux rituals in order to start the recruiting process of these top celebrities and politicians.</p>
<p>They need to test the waters of how far these people are willing to go first, and eventually they continue to participate if they are weak willed. </p>
<p>The same thing happens in pedophile rings. I sincerely believe that many of the pedophiles started off by being coerced into participating in sexual acts with younger and younger children.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there's been a lot of links posted about FBI members revealing that many of these Celebrities and public figures are then blackmailed once they have fallen to the trap. </p>
<p>Good way to keep these people in line, once you have their secrets to use against them.</p></p>

<p>It INFURIATES ME these same people, these hypocrites make fun of religious people and christian churches. Literally everything that comes out of Hollywood is to make fun of Christians and Christianity. </p>
<p>Yes, I think it's weird that Catholics put ash on their forehead, or Baptists screaming in a church, or Mormons wearing magic underwear. But that's nothing, nothing in comparison to what was posted here and Marina's "art". These people need to be exposed and humiliated just like they humiliated Christians. </p></p>

        <p><p>Well assuming they're actually satanists or luciferians, the core concept of that "religion" is to do everything the opposite of Christianity so it's a blatant mockery. They take actual phrases from the Bible and twist the words or meaning, or take rituals or practices etc and turn them upside down etc. it's glorified blasphemy.</p></p>

<p>I've done my homework actually. The guy you mentioned is part of some cults. In that case is it ok to call all christians pedophiles because some are? Or all christians do incest because some are?</p></p>

        <p><p>Me too. I no longer subscribe to organized religion but I definitely see an attack on Christianity. So many shows have an evil Pope. When it was in the Borgias show I figured that's ok because even the Church admits he was a bad Pope. But then you have evil Popes in shows like da Vinci's demons, Marco Polo, and now the upcoming Jude law show. Smh. </p></p>

        <p><p>what's next, the same dinner with kid cakes? How is this remotely ok in any way? I mean if you wanted people to participate in a murder and cannabilism type performance I think cake might be the only medium that could temper the horror. Marina's deal is all about who you become through the actions/performance- for these celebs how do they let the experience transform them in the moment- what do they allow themselves to accept and become? How do they compartmentalize (split) to deal with the experience? </p></p>

        <p><p>FULL COMMENT:</p>
<p>New spirit cooking "Art" </p>
<p>This was a public fundraising event with numerous celebrities present.</p>
<p>It is supposed to be performance art but it is very disturbing,  especially in light of what is coming out. </p>
<p>This info is being deleted at The_Donald whenever anyone tries to post it anywhere.</p>
<p>Maybe the formatting isn't allowed,  so I'm going to do this here as a full post followed by separating it into pieces.  </p>
<p>Maybe one will get through to you guys and you can spread the word because this spirit cooking is having a HUGE affect on voters! </p>
