        <strong>The Twitter "pizza ring"</strong>
        <p><p>These accounts have been around since the creation of Twitter. A lot of people have drawn attention to them and they're easy to stumble upon if you follow some random "daily ass" accounts or just go to some porn site account and check their followers. </p>
<p>It's not a ring, it's more just single accounts owned by many people, whom post cp.</p>
<p>Also, a lot of these pictures are from sets, they could be adverts for the full sets available elsewhere. </p>
<p>And, a lot of these videos are easily found on various mainstream porn sites.</p>
<p>On top of that, some of these accounts also post Russian child models, 8chan had a board called hebe that hosted lots of these images.</p>
<p>Don't disregard that most of these accounts seem to communicate in Arabic... </p>
<p>Don't forget to look at the followers and who they follow to find more accounts to report. </p></p>
