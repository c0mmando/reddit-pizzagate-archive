   <p>
    Yes. Police report of the events of the case are inconsistent for a variety of reasons. Initial investigation said multiple individuals, lead investigator was replaced after suggesting that the parents might have been involved. New explanation for the case says one suspect. It's a very confused mess of a case.

    Not yet. We're lacking in leads available to determine the whereabouts of Tony and John within that timeframe.

    If it turns out that either of the Podestas were in Portugal on May 3, the probablity that they were involved will increase to roughly .9.
   </p>
   <p>
    Right now the probability that they were involved is .7.

You can see the same sketches on the board. This video was from 2013, posted in 2013.

    It appears either John Podesta deleted most of his emails a day or two after she went missing, (or wikileaks/wikileaks source tampered with them to make it look like he deleted them)

    Investigators know who kidnapped her but can't arrest citing international law. Note a lot of the discussion is speculation.

    Note also that Madeleine is a ward of the High Court of England and Wales. Parents hands are tied.
