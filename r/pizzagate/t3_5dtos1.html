        <strong>SHILL ALERT? Monica Peterson's "Friend", is a proud "Sex Worker" and "Sex-trade" advocate</strong>
        <p><p><strong> UPDATE: GIRL LOVER SYMBOLISM ON BELLA ROBINSON'S PHOTO? </strong>NEED CONFIRMATION
http://imgur.com/n6PJ7Zp http://imgur.com/ji0o6eE 
Here's Monica herself explicitly stating she was not in haiti to rescue people. "rescuing people is not in my agenda,(this is a stupid and imperialist concept)": http://imgur.com/a/1p5oJ</p>
<p>Have y'all taken the time to look at Bella Robinson's profile? She is a proud "sex worker", and pro "sex-trade" , and is seemingly happy the owners of backpage dot com were let off.</p>
<p>Here's my convo with her last night 11/18:

        <p><p>Yeah because women who are forced into sex work by abusive pimps, drug addiction, or outright kidnapping don't deserve someone to advocate for them?  You cannot seriously believe that come on man.</p></p>

        <p><p>Even if that were the case there are places where prostitution is legal, even in the US.  having an organization advocate for them would actually be a good thing.  Things like making sure that their bosses are not taking advantage of them by taking an unfair cut, or working them to hard, or putting them in dangerous situations. This would be no different than OSHA or a union.</p>
<p>I'm not positive what category this particular instance falls under, but both seem equally reasonable to me.</p></p>

        <p><p>Nobody said the protection of prostitutes was a bad thing. It is strange that her friend committed suicide after investigating child trafficking. Although, Monica says herself , she was not looking to save anyone because it's "stupid and imperialistic". It's also strange that Robin posts about the sex trade every other post, without giving it a break due to the situation she's in.Your blatant attempt to derail this thread reminds me of the sickos defending comet pizza. If my point is invalid in your eyes, move on.</p></p>

        <p><p>Your last sentence seems to imply that you're more interested in an echo chamber than an actual discussion in which case the mods might as well make this sub private and ban all dissent.  I haven't been overly rude during this discussion, a bit dismissive sure, but I've refrained from name calling, and personal attacks.  I'm simply discussing my views and thoughts on the topic, to call me some kind of pedophile defender is simply untrue.</p></p>

Did you read Bella's response to my message? First she says it was a conspiracy, then she contradicts herself.</p></p>

        <p><p>Do you not find it just a LITTLE bit strange that she is glorifying the Sex-Trade (not solely on the protection of sex workers) right after her friend, in her words, died under circumstances that warrant a conspiracy... Her friend whom was supposedly investigating The illegal Sex-Trade of children in Haiti?</p></p>

According to her logic, if you're trafficked, you're not a prostitute.
"Prostitution is the business or practice of engaging in sexual relations or sex acts in exchange for payment or some other benefit." This payment usually goes to the pimp, or the trafficker.</p></p>

        <p><p>You have to actually read and comprehend the things you post dude.  It's saying that they're not going to be able to convince these women that they need to change their lifestyle so that's not what they're attempting to do.  They're providing them with hot meals and needle exchanges because at this point in these women's lives that's what they need the most.  They need to be healthy and free of disease until they get to a point when they can change their lives.</p></p>
