        <strong>#MamaBig</strong>
        <p><p>In the creepy photo of the room that "JimmyCommet" describes with #Murder... The IG poster MoChef103 ("Mo"= Molester) says "But its so big" to which GordysPickleJar says "Mama Big".</p>
<p>It is a reference to MamasMidwives.com.</p>
<p>I am willing to bet there is a channel or facet of these fuckers that are selling harvested organs after the fact (A la': Planned Parenthood). </p>
<p>I am willing to bet there are some links there.</p></p>

        <p><p>So I went on that midwives site, and saw the design company. Googled it nothing came up, and clicked the link that took me to a weird age verification thing. It was flashing kinda like it was a short gif or something. I screenshot it then gtfo because I didn't know what the fuck was going on. </p></p>

<p>Incest and inbreading... from the cradle to the grave.</p></p>

        <p><p>You're spot on with the mama big, but they aren't selling organs through planned parenthood. That cooler is literally their kill room. They stand in a circle, lay a hankerchief underneath the kid, fuck them and collect the blood/sperm as a token. 
Often the kids end up mutilated.</p></p>

        <p><p>So... I dont think that is really the kill room. Ive beem to Auschwitz, ive worked in US prisons, and i even worked as a mortician at one point.</p>
<p>Institutiinal showers, operating rooms, wlexecution chambers, baptismal fonts...they all use tile. tile tile tile. Tile and BIG drains.</p>
<p>Now, that cooler would be super hot, stuffy, and wpuld pribably suffocate a room full of adults quickly. </p>
<p>It would screem "Walk in cooler".</p>
<p>it would be hard to drain.</p>
<p>It would be hard to modify.</p>
<p>It would be useless for anything l...but a cooler.</p>
<p>His reference to it being a "big pile of cash under a sheet" leads me to invision bodys under a sheet worth money.</p>
<p>And i dont think they sell TO PLanned Parenthood... PP for instamce sells to Stemexpress in Ca.</p>
<p>His comments, and the money involved in human tissue, makes me think this is WORSE than a kill room.</p>
<p>LOOK FOR LINKS TO SMALL BIOTECHS, OR MEDICAL TRANSPORT, OR THEIR FUCKING CREEPY SAUCE PICTURES.</p>
