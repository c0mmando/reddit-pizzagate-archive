<strong>Trying to connect the dots between Silsby/Clintons/Order of Malta????</strong>
<p><p><em>I wish I could change the title now, It has moved more so away from Order of Malta, and new information has come out about the Silsby Clinton connections. Right now my investigation is focusing on finding solid leads between orphanages that traffick children in Haiti and SOMEONE or some group relating back to this larger pizzagate scandal.... there is a mass amount of children who are being funneled through this, and disadvantaged, poor, hungry, children in Haiti/Vietnam etc seem like perfect targets</em></p>
<p>This started in another thread as a response of mine to a question someone proposed on if there was anything ever public on the Clintons explaining why they defended Silsby. I just kept falling down the rabbit hole: </p>
<p>Laura Silsby was obviously embroiled in scandals, defaulting on loans, and traffic violations BEFORE the 2010 Haitian incident, so these would have presumably been on her record? Why would you want to defend this woman?</p>
<p>Details on her failure to pay employees, traffic violations: http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/crime/article24572599.html</p>
<p>Interviews local press conducted in the airport when she arrived back from Haiti: http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/article40706748.html</p>
<p>The archived version of the article discussing Bill Clintons comments when he visited Haiti shortly after the incident: http://archive.is/SNCUW</p>
<p>2010 HuffPost (I know I know) article on the corruption of the Bush/Clinton Haiti fund: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/crossover-dreams/the-clinton-bush-haiti-fu_b_778503.html</p>
<p>Haitian blogger who compiled a lot of great information in regards to the scandals surrounding the Clintons in Haiti (2015): http://thehaitianblogger.blogspot.com/2015/03/hillary-clintons-scandalous-conduct-in.html</p>
<p>Leading Haitian lawyer and a genuine human rights activist, Ezili Dantò, charges that UN Envoy to Haiti, Bill Clinton as head of the Haitian relief fund was responsible for some $6 billion of international relief aid received. “Less than 1% of this amount made it to the Haitian government. Bill Clinton had total control of the balance.” She adds, “Hillary and Bill Clinton ‘opened Haiti’ as their private asset to liquidate.</p>
<p>$20 million off the book donation to Clinton Foundation, from Carlos Slim (Mexican Billionaire), intended to help Haiti but were it exactly went to help isn't known and isn't publicly discussed? http://nypost.com/2016/11/05/the-clinton-foundations-off-the-books-20-million-mystery/</p>
<p>The funny thing about this beyond borders organization is that I cannot find actual proof of real life relief efforts they claim to be providing.</p>
<p>Their twitter account is full of generic pictures of kids and infographics, it seems like they do good work on the surface but it doesn't seem to be of the quality that you would expect millions of dollars to provide... https://twitter.com/BB_Haiti/media</p>
<p>Very interesting article in regards to the LARGE amounts of money they launder through Haiti: http://africasacountry.com/2015/07/hillary-haiti/</p>
<p>The Clinton Foundation alone has directed $36 million to Haiti since 2010. Another $55 million has been spent through the Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund, and an additional $500 million has been made in commitments through the Clinton Global Initiative’s Haiti Action Network. But what does Haiti have to show for all of these investments? Not much, according to Katz. “Haiti and its people are not in a better position now from when the earthquake struck,” he said. The hundreds of millions of dollars and the years of reconstruction efforts have yielded negligible results.</p>
<p>Unrelated but odd its around the same time Silsby was caught Jesuit Priest caught sexually abusing children at a school he founded (a lot of money needed for that?? where did he get that much money?) in Haiti. http://www.cbsnews.com/news/douglas-perlitz-sentenced-for-haitian-sex-abuse/</p>
<p>Justice was served, this guy had 48 million in assets though, which is thank goodness being distributed to the victims, but still I am working hard on the connections here.... https://www.justice.gov/usao/priority-areas/victims-rights-services/services-case-united-states-v-douglas-perlitz</p>
<p>Let me just throw my armchair opinion here though... Perlitz had enough money to BUILD that school and then had 48 MILLION left over?? That speaks to me of something insanely larger than just a Jesuit Priest.</p>
<p>This man, Perlitz, obtained his grant to build this school from "The Order of Malta"? Which a quick search yields this: http://haitionetable.blogspot.com/2012/05/shame-of-order-of-malta.html</p>
<p>Looking more into any connections with Clintons and this Order of Malta, this website looks crazy af but I will keep searching: http://vaticannewworldorder.blogspot.com/2012/05/knights-of-malta-initial-membership.html</p>
<p>So if you are a member of the "Order of Malta" you are considered a "Knight of Malta"... My tinfoil hat is spinning here y'all</p>
<p>I can only find these off the wall websites claiming they know Bill Clinton is in the Knights of Malta.. but they do not have any solid proof... will keep looking: http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/kmlst1.htm</p>
<p>It is odd they all have those long black robes so many children have described hm? In a nutshell, these prominent and influential members of the Order of Malta chose to protect a child molester at all costs and, in doing so, caused the school in Haiti to close and the kids to be abandoned and forced back onto the streets with no food and safe shelter.</p></p>

<p><p>Thank you thank you, my latest lead right now is just an endless cycle of learning how a lot of children from impoverished Haitian families go off to these orphanages with the belief that this is where they will find steady food and showers.... It physically sickens me that THIS MUCH MONEY is being circulated by the Clintons above the Haitians and not actually going to what they have claimed its for. </p>
<p>I know this is all for the pizzagate scandal, and I am trying my best to link this back to it, but I have a feeling this could be how they are funneling these children under the "table".... disadvantaged children, starved, terrified and those that cannot speak english possibly... </p>
<p>(2010) Clintons of course involved with the orphanges, making face showing up to hand out supplies, although local Haitian activists are quick to call them out on only showing up for the press:
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1244339/Crisis-million-Haitian-orphans--emerges-26-left-island-earthquake-claimed-200-000-lives.html</p>
<p>Haitians fear the Clintons:
http://www.wnd.com/2016/10/haitians-fear-clintons-will-scam-them-again/</p>
<p><em>“The best support you can give to Haiti in November is to vote Donald Trump, to stop Hillary Clinton from getting to the White House.”
An unidentified female Haitian activist at the protest agreed.
“You will be making the biggest mistake of your life if you put that woman [Hillary Clinton] in the White House,” she said.</em></p>
<p>Haitian children using orphanages for steady resources:

<p><p>Don't let anyone tell you this isn't pizzagate ... If it wasn't for a supply of children these people would be done long ago... This is the "Pizza" supply</p>
<p>Can we find the method "beyond borders"/ new life/ Clinton got the kids into the US?  Her position as SecState could have made that happen.. If only we can find that trail..</p></p>

<p><p>Im wondering if there was ANYONE who was caught for child trafficking that gave up information on if anyone was paying them to do so?  Even if the person paying them isn't directly a Clinton, it could be a possible lead into a string of money being handed down and filtered out of the larger pocket (if that makes sense... the large pocket being the Clintons most likely)</p>
<p>(2010) exploiting the rush to get Haitian children out of the quake-ravaged country. She recalls the man in the Toyota pickup telling her that "Senators in Washington want us to expedite getting the kids to the U.S." But, she adds, "the Senators are talking about kids who already have adoption papers ready. These guys are trying to exploit all that confusion." 
http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1953379_1953494_1957160,00.html</p>
<p>There have been incidents of foreigners engaged in the commercial sexual exploitation of Haitian children, including incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse reported by the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). There were also incidences of child sex tourism; in 2013 a U.S. citizen was convicted in the United States of engaging in child sex tourism at a residential facility in Haiti that provided shelter, food, clothing, and school tuition to Haitian children.

<p><p>Thank you thank you! I have to go to bed soon but I will be sleuthing again tomorrow. I have turned my attention to pouring over wikileaks for anything regarding Haiti+Pizza+orphanages etc</p>
<p>So far just this... Just a start, but it is Tony Podesta discussing how he used the Clinton Foundation to get in touch with Haitian officials???</p>
<p><em>According to the paper, Tony pressured his brother-in-law for funds. Tony himself
reportedly discussed the arrangement in court proceedings that "were the
result of a lawsuit over unpaid legal bills filed by his lawyer in a child
support case." "I deal through the Clinton Foundation. That gets me in touch with the
Haitian officials," Tony said. "I hound my brother-in-law, because it's his
fund that we're going to get our money from. ... And he keeps telling me,
'Oh, it's going to happen tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.' Well,
tomorrow hasn’t come yet."</em>
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1282</p>
<p>However, Veres Royal said she was appalled not only by the 2014 Clinton
donation but by details she had not known before the Times report was
published -- most notably that the $500,000, which was supposed to go to
causes in the ravaged country of Haiti, still had not been earmarked for
any particular project by The Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p>Extremely long email here from Wikileaks, I cmmd+f for Haiti to get to things faster:
“It’s disgusting to me that this organization is being used in this way,”
Veres Royal said. “I have been to Haiti three times. I’ve seen how
desperate the need is, and it’s disgusting to me that people are trying to
do good while they’re sitting on half-a-million dollars. I think that’s a
disservice to those people who have donated the money, and to the people of
Haiti.”
<em>Bill and Hillary Clinton -- now a Democratic presidential candidate -- have
been heavily involved in the reconstruction of Haiti after the 2010
earthquake, though their role in the country’s recovery has come under
scrutiny amid accusations of running a pay-to-play operation with Haitian
reconstruction.
The Clinton Foundation did not respond to FoxNews.com’s request for comment.</em>
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/158</p>
<p>My arm chair opinion real quick, although in this next link it is really great that they were working to actually understand and fight these issues in Haiti, they had the money at the time to get involved and really stop this. The scandals that kept happenning later on could have been stopped if they intervened quicker....
https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09STATE60553_a.html</p>
<p><em>Last edit for the night right now y'all, headed to bed, will start sleuthing again tomorrow... if anyone has any key terms or ideas or leads send em my way or feel free to keep updating this please!</em></p></p>

<p><p>Cross Post of another response of mine from another thread:</p>
<p>Not sure if anyone is monitoring this thread anymore,but just came across this stuff that I haven't seen in my research:</p>
<p>Lake Azuei is the hub of child trafficking between Haiti and the Dominican Republic: http://www.alterpresse.org/spip.php?article13505#.WC4cXqIrLq0</p>
<p>Podesta emails discussing Lake Azuei: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6022</p>
<p>Clinton foundation building a school, OF ALL PLACES, right by Lake Azuei in Haiti. Oddly though I am having a hard time finding out if the project is even started yet? Where is this school? You will have to cmmd+f and search for Lake Azuei 
https://www.clintonfoundation.org/files/clintonfoundation2012annualreport.pdf</p>
<p>Now looking around the lake and area there in Haiti, there are three schools that do come up as well as a ton of orphanages. One primary school does come up, the same age group that the Clinton foundation claimed to help and build. 
http://www.kozefo.org/primary-school</p>
<p>The thing striking me as odd here is that the website lists that the school can house 120+ students. The building on google maps looks extremely small, and not like a school at all. </p>
<p>I am not discrediting whatever school or positive efforts it looks like that website is pursuing, but something isn't lining up here. This may not be the school the Clinton foundation promised to even build. Why is there so little information online for this primary school she promised to build? The images on the website also show bright playgrounds and bright chairs outside, you don't see any of that on the google maps. I understand it could be a covered playground, but there is plenty of sunlight in the photos on the website. </p></p>

</p>
<p><p>Newest lead:</p>
<p>On a lake known globally for being a huge hub for child trafficking, where the entire surrounding population is in extreme poverty, is there a swanky resort club? They even advertise the prices on the website? 7k for a bedroom? I can't even find the prices on some steak dinners at restaurants locally where I am at. This "swanky" place is VERY close to Lake Azuei, which is also baffling scientists with is rapid rising water levels. Seems like the worst place on the world to invest on trying to attract rich clients... Unless of course they are rich pedophiles. </p>
<p>Also the website is extremely terrible for a resort charging such high fees. I am not very good at finding the domains and technical aspect of these things, if anyone could help with that on this website it could be beneficial for the investigation.</p>
<p>On their facebook they have also posted a lot about the Clinton Foundation. During my work here I have found SO many haitians have deep hatred for that foundation, and it is widely known how badly they have been scammed. Why post so positively about them as Haitians?</p>
<p>Also having a hard time locating this on Google Maps. When you just search for a Club Azure, it locates one location in the states and one in the UK. When I look at the map on their website and go through that, its not on there. When I search for it manually on google sattelite, I am not finding anything remotely like it. </p>
<p>If you were a company seeking wealthy clients, you damn well would make sure you pop up in google searches. Their facebook states the development should be pretty much at completion right now. I am seeing no signs of this place. </p>

<p><p>New leads on all of this today 11/16/2016</p>
<p>Good website to keep in mind for investigations
(Also the number of results that come up seperately for pizza is disturbing. Please teach your children to NEVER accept pizza from strangers ;-; ): http://www.bishop-accountability.org/</p>
<p>There are several Catholic churches within walking distance of Comet Ping Pong... Looking really hard into if the priests that are there is public information, I am wondering if there is a connection here.</p>
<p>Interesting link with Podesta and the Catholic church:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholics_in_Alliance_for_the_Common_Good</p>
<p>Great website archiving the shady cover ups on the Roman Catholic Church's part, specifically Knights of Columbus, in Haiti AFTER Perlitz was convicted:
http://www.mgr.org/BusinessAsUsual.html</p>
<p>Cardinal Egan who took over after Perlitz left claimed 23 lawsuits on seven different priests was a small amount:
http://www.bishop-accountability.org/news2009/11_12/2009_12_01_Altimari_CardinalEdward.htm</p>
<p>Dojo Pizza abuser was a former priest:
http://www.bishop-accountability.org/news2016/03_04/2016_04_08_Murphy_DojoPizzas.htm</p>
<p>Clinton's attended funeral for priest who was accused of abuse (Cardinal John J O'Connor) Also to note yes I am aware the Clintons are catholic, but they have not attended every funeral for every priest so this stood out to me:
http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/09/nyregion/death-cardinal-ceremony-catholic-funeral-for-singular-man-o-connor-his-city.html</p>
<p>UNRELATED QUESTION... Does anyone have a screenshot or know what brands of USB flash drives that cheesybay ebay was selling? The Dojo Pizza raids mention that abuser kept all of his stuff on Hitachi hard drives... (Graphic article)

<p><p>correction: the Clintons are <em>not</em> Catholic. 
Hillary is a Methodist; Bill was raised Southern Baptist. In other words, they're Protestants, but not necessarily the blue blooded WASPy kind.</p>
<p>Bonus trivia: Hillary was (at least for a few years) a member of The Family/The Fellowship/C Street, a bizarre quasi-fascist "Christian" cult based in Washington DC. Jeff Sharlet wrote a truly bizarre book called "The Family" about it all. Doug Coe is the cult leader. Not sure if he's dead yet. </p></p>
