    Pizzagate for Dummies? Need help condensing the story for laymen, but more than just a summary.

    Is there a "dumbed down" version of Pizzagate? -- more than just a summary. I know a lot of people on Twitter (and IRL) who don't really understand the overall situation. I've sent them to a few megathreads, but they come away with "It's complicated" or "That's awful! But, I don't really understand."
   </p>
   <p>
    When I say "dumbed down," I don't mean they're idiots. I only mean they haven't followed along since the beginning and evidently, connecting the dots in one sitting is not for the faint-hearted.
   </p>
   <p>
    Is there a simplified outline for the novice or layman?

    Go to top posts last week. There are summaries. You gotta go down the rabbit hole to really get the full picture though.

    Unfortunately I think some basic proficiency in network, social media, net etiquette, etc. is still required at this moment in time. I think once more damning evidence is leaked, it will be a bit easier to throw in the faces of those not well-versed in net info acquisition.

    But that might all change in five minutes when someone finds a smoking bazooka that doesn't have a fog machine behind it.

    Look at some of the posts from the past few days with pictures in a meme format. They give a general outline of what has been uncovered. Like the one that has police report sketches of 2 people that look like the podesta brothers.
