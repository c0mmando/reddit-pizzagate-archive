        <p><p>Maybe purchase a bunch of sandwiches and some alcohol and go talk to the local homeless...Don't ask leading questions, but just try and talk to some. Ask if weird stuff goes on around here, etc etc.</p>
<p>Homeless. See. Everything.</p></p>

        <p><p>Great idea -- Not sure which part of the DMV you're in, but I lived in Adams Morgan then Barracks Row for 5 years (until July of this year).  If you go this route, try to find Chino -- he's a homeless dude who sells Street Sense around 18th and Columbia, draws cartoons for Street Sense occasional.  He's a great guy and really approachable.</p>
<p>If you've spent much time knowing the homeless in DC, Conrad (the singing Street Sense vendor who has Snoop Dogg hair braids and a big, warm smile on his face) or Sketch (dude who is ALWAYS out hustling, drawing pictures for people outside of restaurants for donations) are well known, <em>highly</em> connected homeless allies that would be easy to break into this investigation with. </p></p>

        <p><p>TELL PEOPLE WHERE YOU ARE GOING.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take many pictures and have a cloud photo upload facility on the go. Google photos or something is good for this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get as many snaps as possible, maybe just take a peek through the window and see whats going on from the outside at first. If anyone approaches you just say you were seeing if it was busy in there cause you were hungry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ideally if it is busy, its ideal time to go in. Take snaps when you know people arent watching.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LEAVE A FUCKING SOUND RECORDING DEVICE IN THERE</strong></p>
<p>http://www.ebay.com/bhp/wireless-spy-microphone</p>
<p>try looking at some of these things here.
Would donate to know more info.
Try and think of a place to hide the device if possible without detection.
Somewhere you can pickup some good "behind the scenes" chatter</p></p>

        <p><p>The normal day-to-day customers probably don't know jack about what's going on there.  You're "lost in the crowd." Go get us some intel.  Ask how the owner (Jimmy) is doing.  Find a nonchalant way to see if he's been unusually absent in the last few days (i.e. hiding out and destroying evidence).</p></p>

        <p><p>Guy if I were you I'd either A apply for a job because we need an inside man. Or B investigate In ANY way set up a camera, check out possible entrances or secret passages, look around! If possible stakeout there for a night and monitor the parking lot and find out if there's anyone in there at night. Like if I were you I'd just post up in a parkinglot in view of theirs and wait for a motercade of luxury cars to stroll thru at odd hours Any Unmarked vans frequenting the establishment. Look high and low!</p></p>

        <p><p>One downside to this is that Comet Ping Pong is in one of the wealthiest areas of DC and relatively near/surrounded by dozens and dozens of Embassies -- black/unmarked/fancy cars are more the norm than the exception :/ -- still, great thought!!</p></p>

        <p><p>I imagine there would be heavy surveillance/counter surveillance around place where VIPs visit to do shady shit. (I have experience with security systems)</p>
<p>Walk the neighborhood and look for over-the-top camera systems that seem out of place and create a diagram with a street map. Take pictures. Bring a friend if possible to be less conspicuous (it will give the appearance you're taking pictures of each other to anyone watching) go during a high traffic time, as well.</p>
<p>Most normal camera setups on a small business will be simple, inexpensive and pointed at front and rear entrances (where criminals would break in) so anything else on a would be out of the ordinary. (Not impossible, but still odd)</p></p>

        <p><p>Can you go to city hall/ city planner and purchase copies of the abandoned subway tunnel plans? Should be only $15-$35. DC would likely have PDFs. You could post online so we can get an idea of how expansive the tunnel network is.</p></p>

        <p><p>As long as you make sure you don't get in a bad situation, it would be great to have some people near the area checking on it occasionally to observe for odd sounds/people/cars/what-have-you whenever possible. </p>
<p>I doubt they are storing the kids there, but if they are, we don't wanna miss them being moved.</p></p>

        <p><p>Definitely a good start. It would be nice to know the exact layout as it relates to the street and businesses. You could look for secret access points.</p></p>

        <p><p>They have probably cleaned up any evidence by now. </p></p>

        <p><p>It's a shame. Brigaded their social media accounts and every youtube video in relation to the restaurant. Evidence cleaned up. The establishment is too smart to use an outed restaurant. Not to a new client. </p></p>

        <p><p>If they want to keep doing what they have been doing, they will leave a trail. If our investigation has stopped their activities, then may the investigation never end.</p></p>
