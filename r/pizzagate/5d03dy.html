    After 17 years of successful fundraising through her signature event, “The Blacks’ Annual Gala” serving at-risk youth, Founder Lea Black created The Consequences Foundation in 2009 to provide educational options in lieu of incarceration for kids who are acting out or having behavioral problems.
The Foundation’s signature program is The Consequences Curriculum, designed to teach children the consequences of their actions and inspire them to think before they act. A multimedia presentation is shown to teens going through the diversion program in the Juvenile Services Department of Miami-Dade County each year and is also available for purchase to organizations serving at-risk youth with behavioral programs.
Funds are raised through the annual fundraiser The Blacks’ Annual Gala; through private donations and through grants.  The Foundation is a granting foundation and has supported:
Educate Tomorrow
I Have A Dream Foundation
Miami Light Project
Barrett Green Foundation
Juvenile Services Department Miami-Dade County
Since it’s inception, Consequences has worked collaboratively with community based organizations to offer teens in need:
Educational resources including scholarships to junior college; Universities and vocational schools.
Cultural initiatives including music history and hip hop camp for career exploration in the music industry.
Filmmaker’s boot camp to learn filmmaking techniques including script writing to improve writing skills.
Life skills workshops to develop character-building traits and assist with conflict resolution, professional decorum, job search strategies and interview techniques.
For more information about The Consequences Foundation please contact Kimberly McNatt, Executive Director.

    "It started out approximately 16 years ago, when I went to a little fundraiser for at-risk kids at an art gallery. Once I saw where the money was needed and how we could keep kids out of jail and in school, I started raising money from my home. We had our first annual charity gala in my backyard for about 450 people. I loved doing it at my house because we had no expenses and all the funds could go directly to the kids at the school we were supporting. We (meaning “I”) set up an office (the one I kicked Roy out of) out of my house and worked from home. Once we outgrew my backyard for the annual event, and after one year of our annual events where it rained (deluged) and we had to put close to 500 guests plus all the food and auction items inside our home a few hours before show time (I stored all the furniture in a semi-truck behind the house), I went to the Coral Gables Country Club. We later outgrew that, and started going to larger venues and hotels."

    The charity angle worked very well for Sandusky.

     It's sick. It seems that's always the way with those types. They prey on the vulnerable or mentally ill. There's a reason why the majority of pedo crimes are committed within orphanages, churches, youth leagues, etc.
