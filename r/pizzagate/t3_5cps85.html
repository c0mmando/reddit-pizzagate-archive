        <p><p>The shills are coming in full force guys.  The #1 post on this subreddit discussing their techniques went from 96% upvoted to 87% upvoted in less than an hour. The #1 post is this now and the first comment mentioned tin foil and they are vote brigading hard every time it gets down votes. Be careful people. The shills are coming in full force mode to try and do a 180 degree spin on the narrative.  I noticed another pattern with the shills.  Most of them must be in the USA because they seem to show up in USA morning time.  I doubt they are going to outsource shills for this operation because it involves human trafficking/pedophiles/secrecy etc they need to work in house in Washington DC on this one to keep the shills mouths shut.  </p></p>

        <p><p>I've noticed the vote brigading as well, even in this thread. I want to remind everyone to read the "New" section, and not just the "Hot" posts. Some things might be getting buried that are really important.</p></p>

        <p><p>If you had actually read and understood my comment, I wasn't doubting the validity of the pizzagate story. All I said was the shadow government part might make people look at it less credibly. If you want to talk about shadow governments, fine but doing it in this article only hurts the pizzagate cause. How that equates to being a shill I don't know.</p>
<p>Edit: fixed an autocorrect.</p></p>

        <p><p>You're saying a shadow government downplays pizzagate. We know that there is a force that works in secret, in the state department, and elsewhere. South Korea just found about their own shadow government that was there since the inception of South Korea. South Korea has it, America has it too. And so what if we say there is a shadow government? Does it really downplay anything? No, because we know there is a shady stuff happening with or without a shadow government</p></p>

        <p><p>The shadow government is real.  This is a global issue.  Not everyone has swallowed a red pill like this before.  There is researchers who have dedicated decades to this so it is probably offensive to them.  People who don't understand there is a global force behind this NEED TO WAKE THE FUCK UP.</p>
<p>We don't care if people think it is crazy or get "turned off".  We are here to speak the fucking truth even if it makes normal people who don't know a fucking thing uncomfortable.  IT IS FUCKING CRAZY.  PEOPLES WHOLE REALITIES ARE ABOUT TO SHIFT BECAUSE OF PIZZAGATE.</p></p>

        <p><p>I wasn't saying either way on that, just that the people who see that as tin-foil would be turned off of this article by it. I was just saying it would be better to keep the two subjects separate if you want people to actually look into pizzagate.</p>
<p>Edit: by not caring if people think it's crazy or get turned off by it is hurting more than helping. If you want people interested in pizzagate, keep it separate from the other, it's more likely to get actual positive attention that way.</p></p>

        <p><p>I've held extreme skepticism to conspiracy theories in the past, but the Podesta emails tell too much, and only matches up perfectly to what "crazy people" have been saying for years.  The link has been made, with thousands of emails worth of soft evidence, and the FBI having way more.  Trump may actually have just pulled off the biggest revolution in US history, and nobody even knew it.  I can't wait to hear his inaugural speech.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't get it. We should be supporting this investigation anyway we can. If you dismiss this as a conspiracy then you rape children. What kind of potato head would deny this? There is more than enough information to look into this and do you see what happens when we look more into it.. We discover more... Keep searching. Keep spreading the information. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah but we need a prepackaged media Kit that is considered reasonable and based on facts. This sub is devolving with all of the new shill activity. I'm seeing more aggressive/high emotion posts. I'm seeing a lot of new so-called hot trails that are really poorly built on the existing facts and discovered links. </p></p>

        <p><p>You're right. The sub is very very rapidly gaining ground, and with that comes a huge influx of critics (which in the right context can be useful), skeptics, shills, as well as trolls. And with new information constantly coming out through leaks like wikileaks and the dc leaks (is that what it's called, right?) as well as lots of individuals acting as information diggers we are having to constantly update with "summary pages" or images that can get new arrivals up-to-date. It's a lot to handle, and hard to organise. Everyone needs to constantly remind each other to stay calm, avoid witch hunts, make sure anything being posted is verified before claiming it to be fact, and act civil. Report anyone who you suspect to be shills or trolls so we can avoid the threads from being derailed, and help encourage everyone to stay on topic. </p></p>

        <p><p>You can link the journalist to:</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/
https://github.com/PedoHunter/pizzagate</p>
<p>And tell them people are very interested and they can get a lot of traffic.  Show them the google trends.  Journalist want to have the breaking stories.  Tell them to post it here after for huge exposure.</p>

        <p><p>Of all the stuff I've read about this, this article is the worst. I'm not talking about the story itself or how true or untrue it is, but when they start throwing that "world shadow government" around it kind of lessens the believability of the article. It comes across as another tin-foil hat story.</p></p>

        <p><p>The amount of spin and over reach on various news articles is what bothers me. It distorts the very interesting and disturbing basic issues of pizza gate.</p>
<p>preconditions:</p>
<p>Cheese Pizza is a code word for child porn
Pizza is a general codeword for pedo stuff
Raccoon/panda is a code word for an abused kid </p>
<p>Fact one: The podesta emails reference the word pizza in strange and unintuitive Ways.</p>
<p>Fact two: they are linked to comet pizza</p>
<p>The social media for comet pizza and related comments or a quirky at best and disturbing at worst. All centred around the theme of pizza and/or children</p>
<p>The link to the DOJ is also really interesting </p>
<p>Let's just focus on the things that are there. Overreaching speculation on other links that are not there, should not be rising to the top. </p></p>

        <p><p>OMG TIN FOIL BRO TIN FOIL BRO ( You shills gotta change up your techniques/lingo from time to time if you wanna stand a chance against us.  We will hunt you down for defending these pedophiles. ).  The new world order is all fake blah blah blah.  Ever heard of the bilderberg meetings?  Ever heard of the bohemian grove? Ever heard of the United Nations agenda 21? Your post history shows you are working for Hilary Clinton. Clinton's Fbi Files Literally Mention "The Shadow Government".  If you don't think there is a world shadow govt then you have not researched enough or are shilling.   GTFO you pedophile enabler.</p></p>

        <p><p>You really are an idiot. I wasn't talking about whether the pedophile story was true or not, all I said was jumping from that to a shadow government lessens the impact of the story. And I like how you just assume anyone against Trump is for Hillary, I never supported her or voted for her but you'll never believe that. Calling everyone that has the slightest difference than you a shill doesn't make it a legitimate arguement. I think you're basement is calling.</p></p>

        <p><p>No I am not.   You are throwing the word tin-foil hat around to anyone who says there is a shadow government.   You came in with your other shill friend who said the exact same thing.  Your usernames are both very similar with two underscores between 3 parts.  I know you claim you are for Bernie in your post history but you flock around reddit all day long talking about Hilary.  It is very suspicious to say the least.  This subreddit has been attacked the last 48 hours with the word "tin-foil".  We are not stupid and know your techniques.  I have done way more research on this case then you so STFU.</p></p>

        <p><p>That's like the first time I've said tin-foil on these posts. My name has the underscores because without them, the name wasn't available. I don't talk about Clinton that much, if the story is about Clinton, then yes my comments will be about her. This one isn't and I didn't bring her up. This is the first time I've commented on this subreddit. All I was saying is if this article wants to bring attention to the pizzagate thing, stay on that topic and don't bring in the conspiracy part, it takes away from the story. How that, and your circumstantial evidence adds up to me being a shill, I don't know. But for you to claim that calling this tin-foil based on the thin evidence they use is being a shill, then you go and make that assumption based on similarly thin evidence is kind of hypocritical.</p></p>

        <p><p>First time on this 1 account maybe.  I know how you shills work.  You run around defending whatever your boss tells you ( for you its usually Hillary. ).  You are pathetic and the scum of humanity.  You will keep commenting over and over to try and prove your not a shill.  You have your shill friends upvote your comment so you can take control of the narrative claiming we are a bunch of tin foil conspiracy theorists. Your boss says use "tin-foil" and you keep using it even though the #1 post on the forum right now addresses that shill technique.    GO DIE.</p></p>

        <p><p>This stuff has survived for so long partly because it is so crazy and unbelievable. They have used the 'craziness' of it all to help stifle any meaningful discussion, and this is exactly what you're doing as well. However, the evidence is showing that this really is bigger and more disturbing than what almost anyone thought. </p></p>

        <p><p>I get that, and it's a legitimate concern. But if this whole ordeal has taught us anything, it's that we might have to suspend belief for a moment of what we thought was real. We shouldn't automatically jump to any hasty conclusions, but we should be patient and consider all possibilities given the evidence.</p></p>

        <p><p>Hoping to hijack this comment due to its relevance to what I want to address. I agree with you in that this article may throw off anyone new to the sub/this research/conspiracy. I want to remind everyone to try to keep the discussion on topic of paedophilia sex ring. Yes, it does indeed link in with the spirit cooking/satanist cult (although to call them "satanists" would be slightly misleading on technicalities) alongside the shadow government/illuminati/whatever the fuck you want to call it. But throwing all those terms in with this this may dissuade newcomers from reading any further.<br>
What we've uncovered so far, and are continuing to uncover, is a big fucking pill to swallow. We have to ease in new arrivals and not throw around so many terms that are so commonly associated with "tin foil." Present what we know in regards to pizzagate/paedophile sex ring, encourage new arrivals to think critically for themselves and do their own digging. Let them discover for themselves how all of this links in with everything.<br>
I know that no one with half a brain will take an article saying "the illuminati and shadow government are all satanic paedophiles!" for fact if they've never considered it to be so prior to discovering this sub. People need to be eased in, and we need to be respectful toward that. Thanks for reading and please share the story while encouraging others to do the same. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah I could see that. But someone reported your comment as "CTR pedo protector" so obviously some people weren't able to see what you were getting at. Thought I'd just do a detailed explanation for those who misunderstood. </p></p>

        <p><p>I really hate how motherfuckers turn this into a political fight. </p>
<p>No, it isn't just those damn democrat pedos, no, it's Donald Trump (Epstein's little black book) and republicans too! This is a group that transcends political parties. The only qualifications one must have is power.</p>
<p>If democrats see this article without knowing anythig about the situation, the average would automatically jump to the conclusion that it's <em>those tin-foil flat earther republicans at it again</em>. Same goes if it's accusing republicans. </p>
<p>We have to make sure to not fight against eachother on our political views, but what we know is morally right. We have to fight the real enemy, the evil, powerful plutocrats, and not each other, because weakness comes hand in hand with devisiveness.</p></p>
