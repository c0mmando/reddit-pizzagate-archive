<strong>Fake article sent to Tony, forwarded to John about closing Italian restaurant with big emphasis on new website</strong>
<p><p>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/8740</p>
<p>I thought this sounded weird, but It's just an article about a closing restaurant, right? Except it only exists online in this e-mail and all the websites mentioned don't exist. Why is this restaurant owner writing an email to Tony disguised as an article that doesn't exist anywhere else and putting such an emphasis on a new website that doesn't exist? It's very suspicious. </p>
<p>Nowhere else on the internet did he ever try to promote this site where "Browsers
may enjoy cooking tips, recipes, cooking demonstrations, cooking tours
to Italy and more!"</p></p>

<p><p>I don't understand what you are implying here. Google results for a restaurant called Ristorante Luigino (which closed) and Chef Carmine Marzano (who now has a place in Alexandria it appears) were easily found. It sounds like Luigino closed and the chef was trying to parlay his stint into a new website that either didn't take off or is now defunct. This email was sent out by a PR team and a legit email-deployment service was used (some of the URLs are analytics-tracking URLs attributable to ConstantContact). I think this is benign.</p></p>

<p><p>Yes, it does exist. It had 3 reviews on Yelp. It seems they moved their business online and never promoted it publicly.. only disguised in an article to tony podesta. </p></p>

<p>Probably taken down because it's old. The email was sent in 2008.</p></p>

<p><p>It was on a list of places on the page. One out of many, could be nothing. It's a children themed organization.</p></p>

<p><p>No double layers in this email me thinks.
Ristorante Luigino closed, and the podesta are genuine cuisine lovers too.

<p><p>This article only exists in this email. He never promoted this website anywhere else online. I'm aware the restaurant closed. It seems they moved their business online. </p></p>
