<strong>Is this sub safe again?</strong>
<p><p>Yesterday there were <strong>very obvious</strong> shills running around the sub and the mods were clearly taken over. Are we still steering clear, and can any mod prove it?</p></p>

<p><p>There are still plenty of legitimate skeptics, fringe lunatics, people with an agenda, shills, etc.  Be thankful the sub is still up.  Make sure you are as anonymous as possible and the sub is safe.  </p>
<p>The mods are not taken over, and never were.  Pizzathrowaway777 started the sub, and appears to still be "in charge."</p>
<p>If anything these type of posts are adding to the discord.  Even the_donald and r/wikileaks and have good discussions despite some moderation issues.  </p>
<p>Contribute quality, and you will be upvoted -- unfounded, unverifiable connections and accusations will probably be downvoted.  That is a good thing.</p></p>

<p><p>My post isn't making it worse.</p>
<p>1) it roots out possible shills if they try to defend themselves</p>
<p>2) if people can actually confirm it, that's the end of it.</p>
<p>Other than that, your response was too vague for me to find useful.</p></p>

<p><p>I think you're over exaggerating. Yesterday, our friends reported r/pizzagate compromised. Am i really a fool for trying to prove it? Maybe we're at semantics here, but I saw it as important for others to be able to come to a conclusion for themselves. </p></p>

<p><p>Well if it is really compromised how do you prove it?  Do you want to get bogged down in a debate over whether the mods are colluding to stop discussions (I would ask what they gain), or do you think that it may be more positive for this sub, to contribute quality posts that further our collective understanding of this scandal and the people involved?</p></p>

<p><p>A lot of times the patterns in language are enough for someone like myself. To try to explain to you my position would be rather futile. You're wasting both of our time here.</p></p>

<p><p>If you were wondering why I take my role as a moderator so seriously, feel free to read my comment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5don4v/attn_addressing_concerns_of_subreddit_compromise/da6bboa/">here</a>...</p>
<p>Basically I view public discourse as the enabling condition for legitimate democracy; and work tirelessly on reddit to ensure the free flow of information.</p>
<p>It saddened me that I was removed as a mod, and I do hope the community understands I exist on this platform to thwart the very thing I was accused of doing. I suppose I am mostly saddened by the fact that concern trolls (not saying any of you belong to that category) have used that same strategy of maliciously false accusations to sew discord between myself and various communities I have been asked to moderate over the years (almost always in a "moderator oversight" capacity).</p>
<p>No surprise that yesterday's events came about within 2 hours of this sub being featured on /r/drama, as some posters from that sub literally will create artificial drama where none exists (using sock puppets) to stir up communities like the one that is being built here.</p>
<p>Be wary of those meta subs, and the malicious libel they like to spread.</p></p>

<p><p>See that's what I meant about language patterns. We can easily flesh out the ones that come to defend themselves. </p>
<p>You're on the naughty list, now. Take care.</p></p>

<p><p>Saddens me too, I never thought you were trouble as I've seen your name around (on other accounts of mine) and you have positive RES karma on my side. But good luck to you elsewhere I suppose.</p></p>
