      Pizzagate is very clearly the source of the new found hate for the alternative media from msm. Google is about to declare war on them. The president has personally weighed in on it by slamming "fake news". Twitter is on 24/7 damage control. That alone should tell you that while all of this can be considered speculation until incontrovertible proof is found, whatever is being uncovered here likely has roots in legitimacy.
     </p>
    </li>

     <p>
      Mainstream media cannot be trusted to cover this. All of the major networks have been guilty of colluding with the government for the past few decades from the false flags with Vietnam, to the pushing of the Iraq wars onto America, right up till the recent election where they pulled out all of the stops trying to elect Hillary. They can't and won't cover it ever, so please keep this up.
     </p>

      From the pedo ring the UK being exposed to the cult in control of the South Korean president, this shit can and does happen in this day and age.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      There has been nothing but complete and total silence from the people involved in this save for that shitty pedo musician. None of us are naive enough to believe that something like this wouldn't be swept under the rug by the powerful people caught up in this.

     Yes the elites harvest the blood, stem cells, and other goodies from these babies and children they are snatching up and using them to increase their own lifespan. Just look at David Rockefeller, he is 101 years old and has had 7 heart transplants.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, these are the children and babies that they're not raping and using in Satanic rituals.
    </p>
    <p>
     These people are pure evil.

     I don't think he was being literal.  Calling a person a reptile in this instance is probably referring to the worlds leaders are bunch of sociopaths/psychopaths.

      Most likely referring to the "reptilian segment of the human brain" that controls some survival instincts and hierarchical structure. Kind of a common insult, but would more casually be phrased like "heartless" or "soulless."

    The next big fight is over media, like will Breitbart get a White House press pass, will CNN and MSNBC lose theirs, can alternatives to Google/Facebook/Twitter catch on, Pizzagate is the first battle on this front.

    You seem like you are much more educated about this than I am.  I made a post recently mentioning I didn't feel like there was really solid evidence out there and I was losing a bit of confidence in pizzagate.
   </p>
   <p>
    So I ask - what pieces of evidence lead you to believe this is as big and deep as you describe?
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm talking real solid evidence.  Not "well all the little pieces of evidence add up"
   </p>
   <p>
    I ask because I want to truly believe there is something here.  Enough to want to dive deeper.  Like I said I'm sure you are way more familiar with this story than me - just want to hear your thoughts on the best evidence you've seen thus for.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thank you kindly

     The question is, what qualifies as "real solid evidence"
     <em>
      to you
     </em>
     ? Because if we're talking about stuff that would be a smoking gun in court, we obviously haven't found that yet because otherwise that would prompt an active criminal prosecution on somebody and there wouldn't be much left to investigate.  See
     <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dvbht/is_there_any_solid_evidence_out_there/da7kz2w/">
      a comment I left in another thread
     </a>
     for more on that.
    </p>
    <p>
     But otherwise, there's no small summary of key facts that will push this over an arbitrary line and into "solid evidence" territory for everybody. Instead it's literally a case of death-by-a-thousand-papercuts, the same way that physics doesn't have
     <em>
      proof
     </em>
     that Einstein's theory of relativity is "correct", but there are way more than enough observations and results to suggest
     <em>
      it might be
     </em>
     , and it's the best guess we have at the moment. You have to decide for yourself whether you accept it or not, but you can't expect to do so without plowing through tons and tons of details surrounding the phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>
     The reality is, that the ritual abuse and trafficing of minors has been suggested for decades now, are there's a ton of records with "circumstantial evidence" suggesting it:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>

      </a>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     And that's just the tip of the iceberg. But whether all of that is enough evidence to make it "big and deep" or "solid", is up to you. For many of us, it obviously is at least enough to prompt further investigation.

      This is precisely the question that should be posed.

      Many people do not examine their assumptions about what constitutes good evidence.

     Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
    </p>
    <p>
     That being said, being suspicious of others is not in and of itself a crime and neither is digging through information on the public record.
    </p>
    <p>
     For myself, I started witnessing the evolution of what ended up becoming "pizzagate" over weeks when the Podesta leaks happened. I came across several leaked emails from the clinton leaks involving Laura Silsby https://search.wikileaks.org/?query=Silsby&amp;exact_phrase=&amp;any_of=&amp;exclude_words=&amp;document_date_start=&amp;document_date_end=&amp;released_date_start=&amp;released_date_end=&amp;publication_type%5B%5D=42&amp;new_search=False&amp;order_by=most_relevant#results
    </p>
    <p>
     The emails in and of themselves aren't necessarily a smoking gun. They just add more to the suspicion of the Clinton's. Such things like how the New Life Children's Refuge started pricing out how much of a donation they needed to keep and store a bunch of kids. Or what their statement is going to be to the press when they are en route to secure the freedom of these missionaries.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most of what I learnt about the Clintons and their connection with Haiti human trafficking came from a concise post in r/conspiracy (which I ended up turning to because while cnn, msnbc, and abc were having the biggest circle jerk of the decade over Hillary, nobody was covering any of the info that was actually in her leaks) that I came across. Now the official story went that Silsby was in Haiti to help bus poor earthquake orphans out to better lives in the Dominican Republic and that her and the missionaries with her were wrongfully arrested for child trafficking. Bill Clinton himself swooped in to save the day and negotiated the release of the missionaries, but he could not secure the release of Silsby. Turns out the lawyer that she had made these arrangements with in the DR was indeed a known human trafficker in the region and the Haitian authorities were not about to let Silsby go after that connection was revealed. The lengthy piece I read on it (not from alt media btw but unfortunately also not bookmarked or saved, I'll dig for it) also revealed a couple things that made my head turn in a big way:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <p>
       These kids were not orphans. They were given up by their parents at the request of the missionaries so they could go live a better life somewhere else.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       Silsby was in the area
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       the earthquake hit.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     So Bill Clinton comes in like a champ and while he wasn't able to secure the release of Silsby, she got a sentence reduced to time served and subsequently returned stateside, no harm, no foul and nobody follows up with questions like "Why the fuck was Silsby there before the quake when her story was that she was there for quake orphans?" "why the fuck is she connected to a child trafficker?" and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
     To me this is much more suspicious than pizzagate. Why does it matter? Because the Clinton clan was all involved. Cheryl Mills, John Podesta, et al. With that background already firmly cementing the case that the Clinton's are now directly connected with a convicted child trafficker (in addition to the Clinton Foundations complete disaster with handling funds they received with the explicit purpose of rebuilding Haiti only to let them languish in devastation...I wonder why they did that? Surely not because they convicted their buddy of child trafficking) John Podesta's emails with code words took on a new light for me.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then I came across the one email that had the attachment pizza.jpg. In this picture (which apparently has some really odd encryption in it) it shows two Asian women and a child enjoying a slice of pizza.  Not a big deal, until I found out that one of the women in the picture was actually Euna Lee, one of the two women that were being held in North Korea on charges of illegally entering. The other woman in the photo is Lisa Ling, special correspondent to cnn, and sister of the other woman held in North Korea.  What were they doing even approaching such a country? Apparent "investigating" child trafficking in China. Who swoops in to save the day again? Bill Clinton. Again. Did those two actually write an article on it or otherwise publish a story on it? I haven't come across it if that's what they ended up doing. But for those keeping score at home,
     <strong>
      that's now twice Bill Clinton has had international exposure to child trafficking where he's swooped in to clean up the mess
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Add in the Lolita express flight logs and the fact that Bill Clinton is a known pervert (I.e. Cigar up Lewinskys pussy) and you start putting two and two together.

      This is what I'm taking about.  These are the pieces of evidence in looking for. Thank you!! Again, not trying to shut down every point - just genuinely looking for hard evidence!

       Good on you for still being skeptical. We need to question EVERYTHING, especially when it's confirming our biases.

       Hard evidence is subjective. There are books written about dinosaur's behavior from tracks and bones. As a lawyer friend of mine said, its a good time to be a defense attorney because people watch shows like CSI and believe that there are miraculous sciences that will prove or disprove every case. Is pizzagate beyond a reasonable doubt in trial? Not yet but I do believe it is almost there.

      I absolutely love this post. I've read the same article and did so much research into this and you pretty much summed it up. Don't forget the "lawyer" wasn't an actual lawyer.  You have to dig deep for that.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also, look into Ed Rendell who is connected with HC. He was down in haiti

      Haiti connection: "this lady from the adoption agency is trying to stop our flight and saying we're kidnapping the children."

      People like you are heroes.  I firmly believe it is the job of a reporter to look into things-not to defame people, but in order to find out if something shady is happening.  That's how we got food regulations and that's how we shut down abusive asylums

     Every single one of your posts is ragging on pizzagate and people asking where Assange is.
    </p>
    <p>
     Go die in a hole you piece of shit.  People like you are responsible for ruining the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the face of something you questions, you don't say "Maybe there's something to this, I'll give it the benefit of a doubt"
    </p>
    <p>
     You say "WELL THE NEWS AIN'T COVERIN THIS SO IT'S FAKE HAHA BY THE WAY HILLARY GONNA WIN TEXAS"
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuck yourself.

     You only ever get "circumstancial" evidence in cases like this because nobody says they're off to Epstein's Island molesting some kids.

     The biggest evidence for me was the pedo symbols many of the pizza places and other businesses surrounding Comet Ping Pong used as logos, the artwork used in Comet Ping Pong and Tony Podesta's home that is clearly about pedophilia, and Hillary Clinton's connection to Laura Silsby.

     I've read through your posts and it seems like you have a very level head and a very rational mind, so I'm pretty sure your peng pong is bigger than mine.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fact is that you are not a rational human being. If this was GOLD we were talking about, you would not be this skeptical, not human with your level of education would.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here are the facts.
    </p>
    <p>
     1.)We know that gold is found in veins in mountains
    </p>
    <p>
     2.)We know that gold provides certain kinds of evidence when it is present.
    </p>
    <p>
     3.)We know that a great deal of this evidence, and more, is presenting itself now, from the nuggets in the river streams to the types of minerals in the mountain itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     4.)We know that with a pretty substantial investment we can all become Oprah rich.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet, you are opposed to the creation of the mining guild. Why? Because in my analogy, GOLD=Freeing Children From Slavery. Everyone investigating pizzagate understands that the payout is the end of human suffering. If you cared about that, you would not be skeptical, you would be curious.
    </p>
    <p>
     None of your posts show any regard for children. You acknowledge that pedo rings occur but never wax philosophical on what it means, or what should be done to the perpetrators, or whether they were victims themselves, or how the children will be integrated into civilization once they are free. There is just NOTHING HUMAN about your posts.

   <blockquote>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Pizzagate is very clearly the source of the new found hate for the alternative media from msm. Google is about to declare war on them. The president has personally weighed in on it by slamming "fake news". Twitter is on 24/7 damage control. That alone should tell you that while all of this can be considered speculation until incontrovertible proof is found, whatever is being uncovered here likely has roots in legitimacy.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Pizzagate broke before the election. The media only started to care about "fake news" after hillary lost and democrats were looking for someone to blame for their embarrassing performance and impotent media establishment. There is no evidence it has anything to do with this. This is yet another conspiracy.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Mainstream media cannot be trusted to cover this. All of the major networks have been guilty of colluding with the government for the past few decades from the false flags with Vietnam, to the pushing of the Iraq wars onto America, right up till the recent election where they pulled out all of the stops trying to elect Hillary. They can't and won't cover it ever, so please keep this up.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    No argument here.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <ol>
     <li>
      From the pedo ring the UK being exposed to the cult in control of the South Korean president, this shit can and does happen in this day and age.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Absolutely. Cults exist. And cults are always weird. Look at the weird shit which comes out of scientology.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <ol>
     <li>
      There has been nothing but complete and total silence from the people involved in this save for that shitty pedo musician. None of us are naive enough to believe that something like this wouldn't be swept under the rug by the powerful people caught up in this.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    On the flip side, imagine if the internet started accusing you or your business of being involved in some crazy child sex-trafficking ring. True or false, you're not likely to draw attention to the rumors.
   </p>
   <p>
    Don't assume silence equals guilt.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Tl;Dr  Don't stop. Don't falter. This is big, deep, and legitimate.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    No it's not. Not at this point. This was a conspiracy posted to 4chan on Nov. 3rd. Then 4chan posted the pedophile food code shortly thereafter. It's more of a ghost story at this point.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you doubt the conspiracy, nothing presented thus far will change your mind because there is no smoking gun. But if you want to believe, there's plenty of things you can twist to fit the pedophile narrative.
   </p>
   <p>
    Granted this is only a couple weeks old, but 95% of what I've seen is confirmation bias on steroids.
   </p>
   <p>
    The only thing I've learned is John Podesta has disturbing taste in art and strikes me as a weirdo.
   </p>
   <p>
    But if all of this is true, you guys better pray AG Sessions will indict. It's gonna be up to him.

      You guys desperately need to lookup the term confirmation bias. And stop downvoting everyone who doesn't join the circlejerk. You're just proving my point.

    Those links are great OP.  They definitely prove that these types of rings occur within high levels of power.  But unfortunately I think your proof proves my point even further. Absolutely none of the material you have provided proves the slightest bit that the terms "pizza" and "pasta" used within the podesta emails point to child trafficing and abuse.

    Concern troll? Meh.  Someone using rational decision making to determine if this is a true lead or something that is being heavily exaggerated or misguided - sure.
   </p>
   <p>
    I think that if all the manpower that has gone into researching this, went towards researching other matters such as the disappearance of JA, we might make a bit more of an impact.
   </p>
   <p>
    My opinion.  Hats off to people investigating this - I really hope that there is something here and I can look back and say "damnit those guys were right".
   </p>
   <p>
    Have a great evening gents.

     I'm going to stop you right there, because:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      I posted 9 videos, each averaging over 1 hour in length.
     </li>
     <li>
      You responded in less than 10 minutes after I left my post.
     </li>
     <li>
      You left no suggestions that you had already seen any of them prior to my posting.
     </li>
     <li>
      Therefore it is
      <em>
       impossible
      </em>
      that you actually reviewed the material I posted as you claim, and you
      <em>
       cannot
      </em>
      have knowledge of how much any of it proves about anything.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     Those are inarguable facts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Making a decision after not putting any effort into at least going through the available material, does not count as thinking for yourself, it counts as forming an absolutely useless lazy opinion that's worth nothing to anybody. If you do decide to review your process and actually go through the materials next time, perhaps then you might be received with an actual hint of credibility.

      The links you provided proved that these rings exist within high levels of power.  I absolutely agreed with you and acknowledged this.  Without even needing to watch the full videos - it is clear none of these had to do with the actual case at hand.

        that pizzagate, despite its name, isn't just about some silly code words anymore, regardless of what people want to paint it as. Continuing to insist on the code words alone is moving the goal-posts away from all the information that's been found. Why does an

     why would EMAIL code terms be referenced by people who experienced things first hand? in these situations theyd be referred to in non code. The closest wed get is establishing locations of pizza places as part of this ordeal and this has happened already - especially e.g. with Jimmy Saville in UK.
    </p>
    <p>
     obviously none of the victims would know about the fucking email code names.
