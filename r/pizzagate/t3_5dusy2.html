        <p><p>Anon also said focus on cards.  I wanted to drop this here because it's pure speculation....I have been looking up connections between John Wayne Gacy, John Norman, and the national child trafficking ring that was running out of Chicago.  There were 30,000 index cards found of names of Washington politicians.  In the article, the Lt. working on the case says "I felt that some federal agency should get the cards and I contacted the State Department through the FBI".  Is it possible to FOIA request these cards as the FBI Vault suggested?  Here is the archive to the Tribune article from the 77.  Cover story and then you can continue by scrolling down to page 8 http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1977/05/16/page/1/article/chicago-is-center-of-national-child-porno-ring</p></p>

<p>I thought he said to focus on the <em>picture</em> with the cards.  (I never read that thread; this is something I heard secondhand).</p></p>

        <p><p>I fell asleep with my phone in my hand while reading the thread, so I didn't see it through, but it was a data dump of contact information and coordinates on 8chan /pol.  Contact info for some really big, important names.   </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dg0dj/this_needs_attention_right_now_absolutely_bizare/</p>
<p>I THINK it was all the info that was hidden in this website, so this sub had already jumped on that.  I think.  Pretty cool to watch 8chan lose their shit, though.  </p></p>

        <p><p>For sure, could be that too.  Mostly I just think it's important to trace the history of these rings.  The rings don't just disappear, they've been around for forever.  George Bush and Enron were bffs.  The lead investor at Enron was busted for child trafficking.  Lots of people at Enron were pedophiles.  It's documented.  George Bush, again, was bff with these people.  I think the puzzle will be unlocked through archived articles from decades past</p></p>

<p>Every thought suggested by them is in direct opposition to God and rightousness.</p>
<ol>
<li>The "ten spot" is in opposition to the Ten Commandments.</li>
<li>"Clubs" represents a weapon of murder.</li>
<li>"Spades," a tool to dig graves, suggests death.</li>
<li>"Hearts," holds up the broken heart of Christ for deririon instead of devotion.</li>
<li>"Jack" represents a livertine who lives off the gains of fallen women; one who makes business of commerbliplized vice.</li>
<li>"King" represents the devil, the king of darkness, the god of this world, the prince of the power of the air, in opposition to God, the king king of all the univers.  Satan, the king of darkness, leads and entices men away from God and heaven, downpiano coversd to hell.</li>
<li>"Queen" represents Mary in a slanderous way.  Semiramis, the mother of Nimrod, the great-grandson of Noah, set herself up in opposition to God and instituted, with her son, every pagan type of religion, all of them opposing God.  Knowing that a "Deliverer" should come (Gen. 8:15), Semiramis set herself and son up to be the "Mother and Child."  Ancient sculpture shows this plainly.  She took the name "Queen of heaven," also "Queen of angels," "Mother of God," etc.   She is the "Queen of harlots" and is worshipped as such in every country under different names such as "Diana", "Juno," "Venus," etc.  Knowing God's plan, she ran ahead of God under Satan's direction, and every licentious religion on earth and every anti-Jehovah religion sprang from her unholy, rebelious mind.  She us a slander on the name of the virgin mother of our Lord.</li>
<li>"Joker" represents Jesus, and this is the most horrid blasphemy of all; for the joker is supposed to be the product of an illicit union between the "Jack" and the "Queen."</li>
</ol>
<p>-- Could any but Satan be the inverntor of a deck of cards?</p>
<p>-- A person is known by the company he keeps.</p>
<p>-- Every dissipation of youth has to be paid for by a draft on old age.</p>
<p>(Furnished by Grant Clofax Tullar)</p>
<p>Copied</p>
<p>Editor's note:  The "Joker" as discribed above points to the clown-fool character of ancient religion.  This figure, a real man, was sacrificed in place of the King of the land.  It is refered to as the "ritual sacrifice of the king."  Since the King had to be sacrificed yearly (relating to sun worship and/or Saturnalia), but he of course was indispensible, a Fool (or Clown) was selected for the "privilege" of dying for the King.  He was then called the "King" and treated "royally" before he was killed in place of the real King.</p></p>

        <p><p>I researched "Absolute Return for Kids (ARK)" - they are Clinton Foundation donors in the 1-5million range.  I discovered Lucy Heller is the Chief Executive.  I used duckduckgo to search "Lucy Heller", selected images...and ended up going down a rabbit hole.  This is one of the sites that should be looked into:  http://www.lucyheller.de/meine-familie/</p></p>

        <p><p>Susannah Hares is another officer of ARK and if you do an image search for her on ddg.gg -- many pictures of rabbits.  This offers another clue?  Someone published an excel file of Clinton Foundation donors with filename "Clinton-foundation-donors-25k"....we should divide and conquer this list somehow.</p></p>

        <p><p>Could not see anything out of the ordinary on that website. The only thing is that there is no imprint (which I think is required by law in Germany, but not sure if this might only apply to commercial websites). Other than that, it's about a girl named Lucy Heller with Down Syndrome, detailing her progress from birth (in 2010) up to now (2016), such as learning to use the toilet, talk etc. Some info on Down Syndrome, some areas under construction. Dead lead as far as I am concerned. Just entirely irresponsible parents who post these very private details and photos about their kid. </p></p>

        <p><p>Nationale Postcode Loterij donated over $25,000,000 to the CF. It is the biggest charity lottery in The Netherlands. One of their biggest charities is Terre des Hommes. Who are they? "For children, their rights and equitable development". They work to stop child trafficking and exploitation in over 69 countries. Why are they donating so much money to the Clinton Foundation? Bill Clinton is an ambassador to Nationale Postcode Loterij, I find this odd.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is worth looking in to. The Dutch go way back. From the creation of the Bilderberg Group to "Het Ronde Huis" (The round house), a place where supposedly all kinds of rituals and paedophilia (familiar subjects right?) took place. The Dutch royals were supposedly involved, too.</p>

        <p><p>I'm down to donors who contributed $1000 or less and I haven't found them yet or I've missed them. There are so many donors I'm going to stop searching. The big donors are the ones to look into. Bill and Melinda Gates gave over 25,000,000. I can't help but be sceptical about Bill Gates and his supposed charity. </p></p>

<p>Where can we get the donor list? </p>
<p>And where can we get the list of organisations connected?</p>
<p>THIS is where we need to focus. The pictures on social media are great for getting connections, but we MUST focus of following the MONEY.</p></p>

        <p><p>We don't, although some of his claims did come 'true'. Although whether he actually had inside information is debatable because he did really only 'predict' what everyone on here was theorising anyway (this is an unpopular opinion in these subs, a lot of people aren't willing to admit his predictions were nothing special. They're too caught up in the thrill of it all to think rationally).</p></p>

        <p><p>A lot of it has to do with hope.  Hope that someone is trying to do something about CF and CGI and all their tentacles. It is very easy to believe things when real evidence from Wikileaks  shows us how many people are in the corruption up to their necks.  People then start thinking anything is possible.  I read everything without real evidence with skepticism bc of my background in research, but it can be difficult to keep perspective sometimes.</p></p>
