        <strong>ATTENTION: Regarding Twitter Posts</strong>
        <p><p><strong>DO NOT LINK TO THE TWITTER ACCOUNTS RELEASING ACCOUNTS WITH CP.  WE CANNOT VIOLATE THE REDDIT TOS IF YOU WANT THE SUB TO REMAIN UP</strong></p>
<p>That being said this is a very interesting development in terms of censorship of #pizzagate, despite the existence of these accounts.  Feel free to discuss the twitter developments openly, but do not link directly to any of the related accounts or accounts releasing the offensive accounts.  Sharing these direct links enables actual criminals and will get this sub shut down.  </p>
<p><em>Addendum: I just need to tell you guys, thank you for understanding our angle.  While we understand that this is tangentially related because Twitter is simultaneously censoring #pizzagate while hosting CP, we need to adhere to the the Reddit TOS.  This community is awesome (for the most part), and I appreciate everyone's dedication to exposing and preventing child abuse</em></p></p>

<p>The mod team is fully aware of this unusual disappearance but we have everything documented. I suggest screenshotting or archiving things you deem important. Remember to follow proper U.S Federal Laws and Regulations!</p></p>

        <p><p>If you are serious, seeking legal advice here is not a good idea.  Clear your browsing data, and start documenting what happened so you can establish it was an accident.  Again, this is not legal advice -- more like friendly advice.  Talk to an attorney if you are actually concerned.</p></p>

        <p><p>There are few ways of actually removing data from a drive without being a professional or someone with a genuine hobby. Clearing the browsing data on the browser is essentially meaningless. Documenting everything you did and sending to lawyer, maybe.</p></p>

        <p><p>Technically it is downloading, yes; but the reality is, you're not going to ever be imprisoned because you clicked a link on the open web.
If you moved the images to folders on your desktop from your browser's program data files, that would be an entirely different story.
But simply clicking on a link..... </p>
<p>I can, with 100% certainty, state;
a person would not be persued by any crime agency, given such a scenario.</p></p>

<p>The other thing that all these people panicking are not taking into account is <em>resources</em>.</p>
<p>Do people really think that since #twittergate broke, that <em>they</em> are the <em>only</em> ones that were curious and clicked on those profiles?</p>
<p>The FBI doesn't have the resources to go after someone that was being a curious dumbass for 3 minutes. Not when there are people distributing <strong>terabytes</strong> of CP and have been for a long time.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'll be brutally honest. Sorry. But if you looked KNOWING what it was and was curious then you're a stupid fuck...... But I get why people look (and not for sexual reasons) however, if it was an accident, it is VERY unlikely you'll be arrested. Very unlikely. Put it this way, these sick fucks aren't getting arrested so for you clicking and clicking off, you should be OK. Accidentally exposing yourself to it is actually a legal defence (in some countries). I advised somebody else to maybe at least report the page and at least if you did get spoken to, you can say "Well it was an accident and I did report it". If you KEEP clicking or 'accidentally' keep going back (not saying you personally but generally) then you may have other issues and are going to be arrested. To anyone else exposed, report it and go to r/eyebleach to forget. </p></p>

<p>I don't think anyone could reasonably expect to see what I saw on those twitter pages. I honestly thought it would just be some "child model" shit-hoooooooo boy was I wrong</p>
<p>I thought stuff like that only existed on the dark web, but there it is right on twitter for the whole world to see. </p>
<p>I clicked two of those links, cleared my cache and never went back.</p></p>

        <p><p>So when somebody says there is child abuse, you clicked thinking it would be wrong and you'd be ok? Why do it? Seriously I mean why? We know it exists. I know of some material that I called BS on because it sounds unbelievable. I have heard (from LE sources) of 'literally' stuff you couldn't imagine. You think how did the sick fuck even dream it up, but I take it as given not because I'm a shill/sheep/asleep/blah fucking blah but because I know. Don't do it. You are breaking the law (you didn't accidentally stumble on it, you suspected it was there because you went there and sought it out) and maybe as important, for your own sanity, you will fuck your mind up. I am not kidding. </p></p>

        <p><p>I hear what you're saying like many, looked out of curiosity or disbelief. But don't click on it. People who do are generating clicks and interest which keeps it alive and in demand. </p></p>

        <p><p>I haven't seen what you've seen, and Lord there is an evil I am only beginning to become aware of, and for these kids, it's been their LIFE! </p>
<p>Yesterday when there was that major Honeypot here, I was so scared to come back to this site. Then I really looked at that instagram pic of the baby gumming the currency - usually I don't look at it because it's so terrible. I was scared but I looked long at that baby, that life, no love but only abuse. I'm more afraid that this happens to children, then I think I might be for myself at this point. </p>

        <p><p>Sorry you will have to refer to the twitter account list then look for account that starts with AC9...and excto...I cannot link them...and trust me you don't want to see them you will not be the same. The accounts are still live..I've already seen it so I'm just keep watch to see if they're deleted...they are still live.</p>
<p>I cannot get the despair of those two young boys. I've seen gay porn...this isn't it...they're so thin...so thin.</p>
<p>and if they can ban libertarian/trump tweeters go after Milo and others...they COULD go after this and ISIS.</p></p>

<p>Is the FBI coming for me now?</p>

<p>No. The FBI doesn't go for people that have never looked at CP in their life, have no other histories, and just happened to click on a few Twitter profiles. Especially given that #twittergate was trending, I'm sure plenty of others did what you did as well.</p>
<p>The FBI is interested in going after people who actively <strong>distribute</strong>, that is the key.</p>
<p>All that being said, don't do it again.</p></p>

        <p><p>So, I found a guy in the list, who have a site and all personal informations in it. (legal site)
What must I do ? I don't know if all the people in the list are subscriber of pedotwitter or not. I think it's not a proof ... so I don't think I need to report this guy to the police. I don't want to report in general, but.. I don't know if I need to do this time. It's childs lifes we are talking !</p>
<p>Ok we have a list. Now what can we do ? Just report to twitter ? I don't think it's enough.</p>
<p>So, don't know what to do...</p></p>

<p>What I think it's we can't do anything with that ... and that is the biggest issue in all that story.</p>
<p>Report to FBI ? How to know if they are going to do someting ? FBI is compromised with politics...
Report to police ? What can they do with it ? They can report to FBI ? &gt;&lt;
I can't stay inactive while all this shit is happening ... because I know all that story are going to be forgeted like all others in some times ...</p></p>

<p>I think I just will try to go to police tomorow, to ask if they can do anything. If not ... so, just have to wait and see if something is going to happen with all that story, but I have no hopes ...</p></p>

        <p><p>I'd say start local and move up the ladder if you don't see progress being made. Make it clear to them that you're going to ensure they're making progress. Let <strong>multiple</strong> people that you trust know you're doing this who will be able to get the word out if something happens to you. Not just close friends/family either. Have a buddy you play Battlefield with from Florida? Tell them too.</p></p>

        <p><p>Don't worry, I live in a safe country (not in USA :p), I don't think I risk something. My family know and some of friends, that's enough. I'm really not afraid about that, the only risk is reddit record my IP and share it if someone ask them because he know I found him in the list ... but it's a random lambda pedotwitter user so it's not big.
Really thanks for your advices, but don't worry for me :) Other ppl take reals risk I think. (Eclipse_OW, 0hours in ex., for what I know)</p></p>

<p>They found twitter accounts that had CP pics and videos... so yeah... you might have thought that CP was only distributed in the DeepWeb super secret shit... and it isn't ... it's out there... to the reach of everyone... in the open... public... on FUCKING TWITTER !!! this is ridiculous and the worst part is that it is TRUE. </p></p>

        <p><p>That still only partly answers it... Where there images and videos visible on Twitter? Where they linked? Was it link like "kid f*cked [3:25]" or more hidden? How do people find them, hashtags or do you have to know the user? 
Isnt everything on Twitter open? Why would people take such a risky route?</p></p>

        <p><p>guy linked a bunch of active twitter accounts that had real CP on them.  It is not really related to pizzagate, except that we are concerned that they would censor #pizzagate while simultaneously allowing this filth to go unnoticed.  </p></p>

        <p><p>The accounts are not related to comet pizza or Podesta, but another ring of pedos on Twitter actually posting pics to eachother. Ok. These people were connected? Who are they..any symbols or codes?</p>
<p>I was watching the 60 minutes Australia, where they mentioned another code I hadn't heard before. </p>
<p>It's called P.I.E.  the Pedophile Information Exchange.</p>
<p>Pizza Pie.  Was this mentioned here yet? </p></p>

        <p><p>I was trying to remember , I read about 1000 Podesta Emails, there must of been pie in some of those.. </p>
<p>But Ok, I'm honestly sick by the idea to search for pedophiles information exchange on Google so I will compile a thread with information quoted from the video, I have to search emails again, ugh.. Maybe some others can add other links because I know nothing about my network or any of that shit or how a computer even works ,so I don't even want to look at PIE, this shit has me paranoid sometimes.</p></p>

        <p><p>Are we sure this is legit? It almost feels like a set up... knowing that most people are at work on a Monday morning and would not risk clicking anything with CP, it seem like it could get a lot of attention without much verification.</p></p>

        <p><p>I looked at some things and I saw nothing illegal. I picked 10 accounts at random and looked through the last few pages of tweets. </p>
<p>Most of the girls looks much older than teen. Some of the reported accounts had granny porn. There were pictures of young girls clothed with sexually suggestive comments like "come get some" but no nudes. Some of the still images were of younger looking porn stars. Some of whom were recognizable based on face. </p>
<p>As for content, I've seen much worse on tumbler and Reddit frankly. I think this is all much ado about nothing and most people don't have the balls to validate that for themselves. I mean the SN app Musically is much more ewwww...when it comes to this content. </p></p>

        <p><p>I looked at one account from Calgary as it was the closest location wise. Seemed like a normal account at first. Noticed a lot of comments of "nice ass" and "sexy" in replies. Looked at what they were replying to...... definitely falls under the Canadian definition of child pornography.</p>
<p>I am not going to look at any other accounts. This is some gross shit.</p>
<p>That account got suspended about an hour after I checked it. But if you view the suspended accounts from the twitter app you can still see the tweets.</p></p>

        <p><p>Report it to your local police as well as the rcmp. With the conspiracy level around here I wouldn't doubt there are enemies of good in the RCMP. All it takes is one good cop looking to make a name for himself to put these sick fucks in jail. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yep. Don't doubt ambition as a useful ally in this. Cracking a Pedo link can make your career in the RCMP so they would likely WANT to pursue this. </p></p>

        <p><p>links to the tweets should be reported, so we can remove them.  On Twitter you are free to report them as you see fit, though I do not recommend looking at them for any reason.</p></p>

        <p><p>No, this helps our cause immensely, the more we get people talking about this issue the better, and it doesnt matter where the story is sourced from or who is involved as long we get that collective outrage festering and generate more visibility for this issues it will only help to serve our cause.  The woman who broke this story is also suffering from suicidal depression because of what she saw. I want everyone, and I mean everyone to give her a warmhearted pm thanking her for what she did. She just saved the innocence and the lives of a lot of kids. The lady is a literal hero. </p></p>

        <p><p>This stuff should probably go on r/twittergate . I think it's enough of an issue to be on its own subreddit. </p></p>

        <p><p>It is if the twitter account is literally a stream of CP pictures.  WTF?</p></p>

        <p><p>they may have been in some cases, but if I saw a link to tweets, in light of the content people were discussing, it was best to remove them in the interest of keeping the sub alive and not enabling a honeypot or actual criminal to view the content</p></p>
