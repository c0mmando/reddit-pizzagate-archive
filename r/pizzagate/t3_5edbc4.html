<strong>Keep pushing the original narrative! Many newcomers are on here, Twitter, and more. Tell the original story!</strong>
<p><p>I've noticed when I search #pizzagate on Twitter, most of the tweets are now covering secondary leads (like the Podesta kidnapping case) and the backlash from MSM. If anyone new searches the hashtag they will not get the full story.</p>
<p>I made this to help:

(Note: All NSFW has been removed. The penis drawing is debatable but I can remove it if needed.)</p>
<p>We need to push the core narrative in a non-meme format that is clear and concise using just the verified facts. Please share, retweet and hashtag this link. (I don't think I've ever said that in my life, that's how important this is.)</p></p>
