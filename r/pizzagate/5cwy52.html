    Questions about FBI Anon - He Is Crucial to the Success of PizzaGate
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I have many questions about FBIanon from 4chan. Please help.
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     It seems to me that FBIanon in July predicted many things that later became true. He predicted: (A) massive Clinton Foundation investigation, (B) Clinton had SAP documents on laptop, (C) child trafficking associated with the Clintons, (D) Soros being heavily involved, and (E) people going missing when the Clinton Foundation plane traveled to other places (referencing Madeleine McCann I believe). All of these predictions suggest to me, very strongly, that FBIanon was legitimate, and our most powerful source for information.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Questions: What else did FBIanon predict?
Can we verify that he made these predictions before they became public news on Twitter and Reddit (using Wayback Machine?).
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     I'm aware of about three different Q&amp;As that FBIanon did on 4chan. But I cannot find a comprehensive list. And I do not know if he has posted more information to 4chan since the last (third) session. Also, the 4chan format is hard to read.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Question: Has FBIanon done more Q&amp;A sessions since the last one?
Can someone format all of his Q&amp;As to make them easier to read?
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     Recently, the youngest FBI agent, and valedictorian of the FBI academy, died in a mysterious, fiery Tesla car crash:
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    http://fox59.com/2016/11/03/2-people-dead-after-speeding-tesla-crashes-into-tree-catches-fire/
   </p>
   <p>
    Question: Was this FBIanon?
Has FBIanon posted since this crash?
Is it just a coincidence that he died in a Tesla car crash, and 4chan had a story about Trump and Tesla, and the FBI records vault Twitter posted records about Tesla (the inventor) around October 30?
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     In a very strange event, the FBI Records Vault Twitter account tweeted a bunch of different tweets about Fred Trump, the Clintons, Tesla, child trafficking, and other things around Oct. 30. It had previously been dormant for over a year.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Question: the FBI's public story is that these were triggered by three FOIA requests each for the records. Can we confirm that story? If so, did someone on 4chan just go and issue dozens of FOIA requests
    <em>
     after
    </em>
    FBIanon gave his first Q&amp;A in July? Or do the Tweets "prove" that FBIanon was legit?
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     FBIanon repeatedly said that the documents on the Clinton/other emails were so sensitive, that they could easily trigger a civil war or foreign war. He said this many times. So, even though I am happy that Trump won, I am scared that these documents might go public and somehow lead to civil unrest. Can someone talk me down? It seems to me that FBIanon was right about everything so far (give or take a couple of items of disinformation to preserve his anonymity). I saw the Wikileaks encryption key post yesterday, referencing Israel/ISIS/thermite, and I started to worry that this is the kind of information that I wouldn't want to go public, even if it was true, because it would be so politically destabilizing. On the other hand, if Wikileaks had information that was this outrageous (e.g., 9/11 inside job), then I think Assange would have acted very differently in his recent television interview. Thoughts?
    </li>
   </ol>

    FBI anon said that the clintons operate in countries where birth records are hard to verify.  Haiti and their work in Africa would need to be researched.

     The Haitian incident has been strongly connected, where a lady was trying to smuggle local children out of Haiti and was then helped significantly by the Clintons when she got caught.

    I can partially answer some of your questions.
   </p>
   <p>
    FBIanon said that he was aiming to do an AMA once a month if I recall.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have since seen an AMA every consecutive month since the "famous" double thread that has done the rounds on social media.
   </p>
   <p>
    I cannot find the archives for August, however here is September and October respectively.
   </p>
   <p>
    COPY and PASTE links into address bar, clinking will redirect to reddit, be warned!
   </p>
   <p>
    September - http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/90313667/
   </p>
   <p>
    October - http://archive.is/0oVo3#selection-5945.2-5945.10
   </p>
   <p>
    I have't seen anything on November yet !! (ear to the ground)
   </p>
   <p>
    The validity of the more recent threads (especially since the FBI Tesla crash) has been questioned heavily on /pol/, although the general consensus was the writing style and formatting was identical, and it may have just been CTR trying to sew doubt and disinformation.
   </p>
   <p>
    The latest threads are less revealing and are more a chance for people digging into things to get feedback on their findings.
   </p>
   <p>
    I remember him being ahead of the curve for Judge Scalia's suspicious death also.
   </p>
   <p>
    Anon also tried to repeatedly bring attention to human/child sex trafficking in his first thread (begging people to sift through the new Wikileaks, almost to the point where he was annoyed people weren't catching on.
   </p>
   <p>
    Regarding the FBI FOI requests, I believe that /pol/ and Teh_Donald organised and coordinated FOI's together to achieve maximum information and exposure.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm happy to answer more questions and I hope this helps!

       No "wet works" is exclusively a bad thing. It was "pool party" that turned out to maybe be innocent

        I read an article/comment that persuasively debunked this. I wish I could find it for you now, but I can't.

         I have no clue what the original context you are referring to, but it is pretty common knowledge that wet works means an assasination / black op with a kill objective.

           I believe most of the occult/trafficking stuff. I think the odds of Scalia dying peacefully in his sleep are about 78%. That is based on my conversations with personal friends who knew Scalia and said that he was very ill.

      I think we need to prioritize figuring out where the Podestas were when Madeleine went missing. I think the odds of Portugal are about 80%.

     "The common assumption is Scalia was murdered to help bring about gun control via another justice. But then any justice could have been sacked. What was Scalia doing before he died? What topic was he interested in?" - FBI ANON.  Was Scalia aware of the pedo ring?

     This is very helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here are some follow up questions:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      What do you think the disinformation part of his posts were? 9/11 being done by Mossad?
     </li>
     <li>
      Do you think FBIAnon is legit? If so, what do you think will happen over the next 3-6 months in terms of the FBI arresting people, and the Clinton crime syndicate trying to prevent that?
     </li>
     <li>
      Are there any copies of these sessions that coordinate the questions and answers to make them easier to read? Half the time, I don't even know what question FBIanon is answering.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     BTW I have a friend who knew Scalia personally and said he was very sick. I think the odds that it was natural causes are good.

     <p>
      Hey there, quick disclaimer, this is 100% my own opinion I am not stating anything as known truth!! This has become rather long, apologies! Warning in advance I struggled with my formatting so don't hate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Q1
      </strong>
      . The main disinformation I believe to include:
     </p>
     <p>
      The genuine racism about black people being inherently more violent. (These ideas are frequent on /pol/ however.)
     </p>
     <p>
      The Zionist World Order theories although elements of them are coming to light, it is again a classic idea that /pol/ throws around with zero caution. Both of these I believe to be attempts at making their threads blend in to /pol/'s white noise as such.
     </p>
     <p>
      Next is the Holocaust denial, I actually had to do some digging into this as I wasn't sure. So basically a quick TLDR. The theory goes that using world Almanac records (what FBIanon referenced) which have been collecting population data over history, you can see that the Jewish population didn't decline over WW2 (it actually went up in accordance with natural birth rate). However no data was collected during the years of WW2. On top of this, the original records were revised after the war to produce the loss of Jewish life in the Holocaust.
     </p>
     <p>
      Secondly virtually no reference to mass extermination of Jews was documented in Nazi papers when all of their other "master plans" were, apparently. From what I read the only primary evidence of the gas chambers were a couple of drilled holes used to introduce the gas in only
      <strong>
       one
      </strong>
      camp. This has basically led to wild speculation from deniers who's counter argument is that the loss of Jewish life was due to rampant outbreaks of typhoid spreading through the "labor" camps. My problem is the thousands of personal accounts that can easily distinguish between disease and mass genocide. To summarize actually go do your own research on this one because there are some odd things going on with the Almanac records, but most likely not intentional. I don't think the reasoning behind the data revisions was ever noted which means there will always be an argument to be made unfortunately.
     </p>
     <p>
      ( I am
      <strong>
       NOT
      </strong>
      a Holocaust denier. I wanted to understand their argument so I did the research!)
     </p>
     <p>
      Finally as for 9/11 I actually have no idea. Before this election I didn't believe the current 9/11 narrative but I wasn't a full blown truth-er (inside job) guy. I essentially think we haven't been given very much of the truth, which lends credibility to Saudi having far more to do with it than what was thought, as they have essentially proven to cover up US allegiance to SA. Therefore Mossad is a toss up for me.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Q2
      </strong>
      Yes I clearly think he is legit. Even if he is not legit the consequences of his actions are very legitimate. Hundreds of /pol/ users are digging through the Clintons and their foundation with a tiny comb.
     </p>
     <p>
      Check out their findings here at /cfg/ - https://archive.is/0nuFe#selection-918.28-918.29
     </p>
     <p>
      As for what will happen next? Who the fuck knows... I can see a power struggle between FBI and Clinton behind the scenes happening . I think eventually somebody will spill the beans and the public will demand to
      <strong>
       #DrainTheSwamp
      </strong>
      If not and we follow current trajectory of paid riots and carried on attempts to undermine Trump, civil war is not far off of the horizon. =[
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Q3
      </strong>
      does hovering over the post ID number bring up the parent  comment/question? I have seen the first double thread FBIanon did in a much more simple format but it was also cherry picked for the biggest red pills and none of the crazy ideas. The truth rarely comes in a nice easy to follow package unfortunately.

          Did you hear about the conspiracy theory of bearded aerobats who throw passports out of aircraft cabins seconds before bringing down three steel skyscrapers with two aluminum planes? That's probably the craziest conspiracy theory I've heard, man what wouldn't people believe ...

           Probably the most frightening part of the entire PizzaGate episode, with FBIanon, is questioning 9/11.

       Ok wait... you guys clearly missed this link.  Its super important and connects the whole thing together. Please someone take a look to this. This is the truth about 9.11 and the whole pedo entrapment story is revealed including how they are trafficking the children. also
       <strong>
        implicates childrens villages in 130 countries going back to the 60s
       </strong>
       . I thought you guys were aware of this thread i put it up days ago but it was downvoted to oblivion. infact now i think about it it was right after I posted this that the site was invaded and there was downvoting epidemic. I think its because they are trying to hide this thread from you. please look.

       Black people are inherently more violent. See this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Previous literature suggests that one of those conditions may be individual variability in genetic alleles, such that individuals with a low activity form of the gene that encodes monoamine oxidase A (MAOA-L) will be more likely to react with aggression to challenge (12).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Studies have found differences in the frequency distribution of variants of the MAOA gene between ethnic groups:[32][33] of the participants, 59% of Black men, 54% of Chinese men, 56% of Maori men, and 34% of Caucasian men carried the 3R allele, while 5.5% of Black men, 0.1% of Caucasian men, and 0.00067% of Asian men carried the 2R allele"
      </p>
      <p>
       2R is the "violent" allele. People diagnosed with ODD, ASPD and various other behavioral (actual, not "ADD") disorders have also a higher occurance of 2R than their respective races average %. There have been favorable decisions in the courts regarding 2R, leading to manslaughter or diminished responsibility defences in murder cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not because they're "niggers" like pol says, but there is a basis for blacks being more aggressive and impulsive, genetically. Feel free to do your own research but here's a few sources I used:

        Thanks I will check those links out. FBIanon didn't shed light into these genetic arguments, just said that blacks were inherently more aggressive. Which with no argument just comes across as a racist anecdote.

        <p>
         Never take someones word for it, always research yourself. Many people also anecdotally from their own experiences have noticed blacks to resort to violence or aggression, possibly because of the 2R allele possibly because of upbringing/teachings etc.
        </p>
        <p>
         Glad you viewed it from a logical standpoint, science isn't racist it's truth.

     Your October link has him predicting Trump winning CA. That tells me it's fake. That's a hail mary, if he calls that correct, then
     <em>
      obviously
     </em>
     he's legit since CA is definitely going blue. It went blue. He was wrong, and he had some lucky guesses it seems.
    </p>
    <p>
     Either that or it's a fake.

      Well, he DID say that he was just an analyst and strategist. He couldn't predict the future. It could also be that Trump DID win CA, but the rigging was just too much.

      yeah I see your point. If i recall he goes into his explanation saying that he is predicting Cali to be close. Although it went blue ti was closer than people ever thought.
     </p>
     <p>
      As I said above in my long post, the consequences of FBIanon's actions are very real.

      I think this was part of the disinformation - something so extreme that it's obviously wrong.

     <p>
      On the other hand, he was very confident that Trump would win, and would win PA, and would lose NY. How many others got that right?

        True, that was obvious. Trump winning was not. FBIanon was 95% sure that Trump would win. Sam Wang at Princeton was 99% sure Clinton would win.
       </p>
       <p>
        By itself, it's just one data point. But add it to everything else that FBIanon got right.

    I think that crash was actually a rising Silicon Tech Start creating an Amber-Alert alternative. We already know that Amber-Alert is a part of this trafficking ring so I assume Soros had Musk autopilot this guy into a tree. He's already has given Musk 100's of millions of dollars too.

      Google is so fucked in all of this it's so hard for me stuff these last few weeks, I'll try and do some digging tonight, just remember reading about it last week. Not sure about FBI anon, could definitely be him too, no doubt in my mind they would use a Tesla to kill someone. Here you can see Soros' $305 million investment to Solar City https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602487/elon-musks-house-of-gigacards/?utm_campaign=internal&amp;utm_medium=homepage&amp;utm_source=cover-story&amp;set=602584

       Wow that is amazing. I could see this actually being an assassination. A high level FBI agent who uses 4chan fits the description of the youngest FBI agent who was valedictorian of the FBI academy. Also, his Q&amp;A mentioned his wife trying to prevent him from being suicidal, so it could be that too. A shame if Trump won and then things work out...

     Thank you for this.  I was going over this again and noticed some bread crumbs I had missed before:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sex rings are popular in all governments, but pedophilia is primarily in British parliament &amp;
Saudi Arabia, and that’s why HRC and BC love foreign donors so much. They get paid in
children as well as money. Dig deep and you can find it. It will sicken you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "find everyone involved in the State Department who has recently made a
donation or speech in relation to the CF. Public figures are not to meet with foreign officials
in secret – so who did?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Is it just me, or is he saying that proof of human trafficking will be found somewhere in relation to Saudi/Qatar and perhaps speeches by State Dept. officials?

1 month after Scalia hit, Obama lifts ARMS EMBARGOS, opening up GD to new contracts.

    How does Hillary tie in????
   </p>
   <p>
    Podesta emails show campaign discussing TEXAS just prior. 
Also show discussion of wet works at the vineyard.
Also show discussion of WJC meeting with Castros in FL the following day...
Also show discussion of SHEILA JACKIE LEE, and IOWA reps being involved.
Podesta requests a PRO go along, matt, michelle and another M name....
VARGAS FAMILY receives local government positions, per texas SOS.
Castro brothers, instead of VP to lock up Latino vote, he gets HUD position he is unqualified for. HILLARY makes very LATE VP pick...we waited 4ever. She couldnt take him 4 VP because she may have to kill him.
HILLARY AND DNC assure AMERICA they will lock up texas vote..
POINDEXTER stands to benefit from FORD MOVING PRODUCTION TO MEXICO.
US MARSHALL RECEIVES CONTRACT PAYMENTS THRU GENERAL DYNAMICS!!!!!!
US MARSHALL AND CASTRO ARE ON THE HITLIST. 
Vince foster files showed that semen and foreign blood were found in his body, but not in sufficient quantity to test against vinces blood. Closest building to where his body was found was SAUDI EMBASSY.
Tesla docs indicate Podesta may be after the UFO radio that Tesla created to successfully communicate with aliens prior to death. UFO search in podesta emails elaborates on the relevance of this conclusion.
Teslas death ray prototype in the fbi files, is not recovered. His secrets and death ray were stored at Governor Clinton hotel in New York.
Governor Clinton Hotel was converted, and the daughter of the millionaire racketeering guy that Bill Clinton pardoned DID purchase a flat there, later resold.
There may be a connection between governor clinton hotel and child abduction ring.

       The rest of this thread discusses Elon Musk and Soros a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the part where he said 'Tesla docs indicate Podesta..' because Nikola Tesla is long dead and there is no chance he's written any recents documents indicating any living person at all.

         I think there's a deeper play here.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that Musk is planning to send humans to Mars.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you know anything about Airl, the alleged Grey that was interviewed after Roswell, you'd know that Airl believed there was machinery on Mars hidden by force screens (fields) that disguise it and also prevent external damage.
        </p>
        <p>
         This machinery, Airl explained, was used by an old adversary of the Greys (Airl referred to the Greys as
         <em>
          The Domain
         </em>
         , but I use Grey since that's more widely accepted) before they annexed this galaxy. The machinery is used to trap eternal spiritual beings, or IS-BEs, erase their memory, and then implant them back into a new human body. Airl said that Earthlings have been repeating the same life, death, rebirth cycle since the dawn of civilization. Airl went on to say that some Greys (since every being in the universe is an IS-BE) were also trapped in this cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
         Airl explained that the only way to break out of this cycle was to find and destroy the machinery. We can now mine asteroids and missions are being sent shortly, plus this mission to Mars. I actually think the ruling elite may be trying to find and destroy this machinery. It's a wild theory, but it's plausible.
        </p>
        <p>
         Combine it with DMT trip reports and a few wilder spiritual philosophies and it really starts to hit the sweet spot.

          This is interesting, I've never heard of Airl. So you think, if this theory is correct, that they're using Musk to get to Mars to destroy this machinery?

           IDK. I think it's highly likely they are trying to get to Mars to at least verify Airl's story. I think they'll study the machinery (if they even find it) at first. Maybe try to reverse engineer it. I'd like to think they mean to destroy it, but that's because I'm not an evil cuck. It's Soros, though, so maybe he just wants to build even more sinister machinery.
          </p>
          <p>
           Wouldn't it be neat if Musk took his money, went to Mars, found the machinery, and then told everyone on Earth. Went rogue and destroyed it, freeing all of us IS-BEs? Then the will of kek would surely be served because it would be instant to discover who was cuck and who was kek. This is starting to pull in esoteric kekism, but I've had visions of this, so, at least personally, I don't think it's crazy.

        I actually think it's more common to find lesbians in law enforcement than most other professions. Cops, FBI, Military...We could get into the psychological symbolism of guns, but we should leave that can closed for now, I think.

     In regards to the Clinton Foundation, what would happen if all of this information ended up being released to the general public?

   <p>
    I said in the last thread, total chaos. The government would be exposed at every layer, who pays who, who buys what, and no one has yet asked about the human trafficking bits I have been laying out.

     The car crash happened on Thursday,  November 4. I believe the tesla post on the fbi twitter was on october 30. You can check the twitter account,  it's still up.

    Do you have the link to the 4chan post about the Tesla in regards to Trump and the FBI? The story sounds fishy.

    Um, no? Story says it was a 44 year old former agent and a 27 year old fresh law school grad that died in the crash.
   </p>
   <p>
    And I believe it's more likely that someone ran them off the road because they were cheating on their significant others than anything else.

    Comey said the FBI Twitter was not working properly. Supposedly they fixed it and then it started posting old FOIA requests that should have been posted long ago.
    <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/11/01/500297580/more-surprises-fbi-releases-files-on-bill-clintons-pardon-of-marc-rich">
     They talked about it on the radio for about two days and then that was the last of it.

     Right. I think the FOIA requests must have been sent by people who read the Trump/Clinton/Tesla story on 4chan. The question is whether they were sent before the story was published (proving FBIanon is real) or sent after (which doesn't prove anything - although FBIanon's predictions have been proven accurate in many other ways).

     <blockquote>
      <p>
       In a statement late Tuesday evening, the FBI said the files were part of a routine release of information that had been requested multiple times under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA):
      </p>
      <p>
       "The FBI's Records Management Division receives thousands of FOIA requests annually which are processed on a first in, first out (FIFO) basis. By law, FOIA materials that have been requested three or more times are posted electronically to the FBI's public reading room shortly after they are processed. Per the standard procedure for FOIA, these materials became available for release and were posted automatically and electronically to the FBI's public reading room in accordance with the law and established procedures."

      It seems logical to me that you would want to know the date of the request and who requested it available on the same page... for transparency. They basically just dump a link to the PDFs.

       The whole thing is strange. But even if this isn't some clever signal from FBIanon inside of the FBI, he/she still made amazing predictions that turned out to be true.

    I have been reading over FBI anon carefully for about the 5th time and I'm picking up some new nuggets...there is so much staggering info.  This comment kinda depresses me....
   </p>
   <p>
    Q:How solid is the evidence of Bill and the Lolita Express connection?
   </p>
   <p>
    A: "It is there, but entire teams scrub the Clinton’s movements. Finding outright illegal evidence is tough unless it is leaked, so the most you can do is force connections that make sense.
And there is plenty enough to make sense."
   </p>
   <p>
    I take it this means build a really solid circumstantial case and then meme it to death on social media?   The reason it depresses me is that we have gotten so used to people in power being too big to prosecute, but for our country (and the world) to heal, these pedosatanists have to be publicly exposed (in full) and either locked up for good or death penalty.  Anything less than full disclosure will not cut it.  I just hope this has hit critical mass in the public consciousness.
   </p>
   <p>
    Closing thought, we do need to keep in mind the Middle East and UK connections of the Clinton Foundation as instructed by FBI Anon...there might be something there to tie it all together.

     I think no matter what, PizzaGate will become a conspiracy theory like with JFK's assassination. People will be discussing it for decades. Whether it ever becomes proven, and mainstream, that is up to us now.
