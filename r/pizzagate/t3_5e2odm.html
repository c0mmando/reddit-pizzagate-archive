<p><p>They might have lied about their sources... but investigating WeThePizza turned up just as many damning connections to Hillary and DC as wikileaks has to Comet. </p>
<p>We need to stop beating the dead horse that is Comet. There's 1000s more pizza places to bust up... dig into something fresh... 1 month for a million people to take down 1 pizza place is shitty metrics.  </p></p>

<p><p>Who has found any "damning" evidence? Best you have on Comet is a dick drawn on a wall... it is all conjecture. Our job isn't to prosecute... it's to persecute... To strike fear into those that used fear as a tool for so long. The shoe is on the other foot...</p>
<p>If you didn't see the WTP connections you didn't even try... so shut up and wait for someone to make an infographic for you... cause yer not good at doing this on your own. </p></p>

<p><p>yes i saw everything dipshit. if u think comet pp is just a dick in a wall then you havent read 15% of what there is out there about that shitty place. Everything leads you to the owners and donors of Comet. It is all circumstantial but at this point you have more on Comet than on the high profile cheff of the Wethepizza. The only thing suspicious about WTP is a fucking branch in Saudi after 5 domestic branches in USA. Good luck digging in Saudi. The 2GB hacker was a fucking derail and a hoax. The whole subreddit is in jeopardy cuz of what he posted. His friend is shit too with no basic knowledge on IT. The whole subreddit is muddied cuz of gullible people like you. </p></p>

<p><p>Yes... you have more than enough on Comet... MORE THAN ENOUGH... work on getting more of something we don't have enough of... evidence implicating other places. Idiot shill with tunnelvision... think big... hell think at all. Sad idiot. </p>

<p>There... Pizza Pipeline... just as sketchy as Comet... and 1000s more out there... but they take actual work to uncover... and you aren't fit for it.</p></p>

<p><p>wtf is this. some random pictures with kids and pizza. You are confusing marketing with pedophilia. Who is the owner of this pizza chain? What do they do? How are they connected to pizzagate? There is so many things you can connect and then u just throw pictures of kids and pizza and claim hard evidence. pff alright lettuce-head</p></p>

<p><p>It is pizzagate... not cometpizzagate... You only help my cause to expose <em>all</em> the places that are fronts for this behavior... because the users here can smell a rat a mile away... so they know if yer shilling there must be something behind my post. At this point in your career it is better to just keep your mouth shut... you only serve to further incriminate yourself. </p></p>

<p><p>you don't make sense with what you saying but thats fine. Go on collect all internet pictures of kids eating pizza. Nobody's stopping you from wasting your time. I'd rather look into Monica Petersen but nobody is talking about that anymore and I don't fucking know why. </p></p>

<p><p>Get out there and dig in whatever you are interested into digging into... go connect some dots... you aren't chained to Comet Pizza... you are free to dig into whatever you want... so pour thru records... ask on other forums to see if you can speak to someone in Haiti... ask all the questions can. Get the truth out there... but don't just sit around and shit on anything that isnt Comet Pizza... cause it makes you look guilty. </p></p>
