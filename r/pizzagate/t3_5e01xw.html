        <strong>Acceptance of pedophilia = next step in social justice</strong>
        <p><p>OK this is kind of a conspiracy theory, but work with me. Judging by the revelations of pizzagate, which seems to indicate that many powerful elites are pedophiles, I have come to a disturbing conclusion. They are trying to get the people of the world to accept their sick and twisted lifestyle. They knew that they can't get people to accept it of the get go, so they needed to do it in a much more gradual way. First, they work on completely normalizing gays. Then, right after gay marriage was passed they started to try to normalize transgenderism, and in the eyes of many people, they have succeeded. The transgender bathroom issue being the main policy that shows the people have accepted it. Now you see articles about "peaceful pedophiles" starting to make headlines and I personally noticed some related themes on TV. They present the pedophile who doesn't act on their urges but who is demonized for something they 'can't control'. I think that this is to create pity for the individual and the next logical step in social justice. I kind of heard this normalizing of pedophilia theory before from others, but I never understood why would anyone want this? After pizza gate, it becomes pretty clear. These people have been slowly working on us accepting their sick lifestyle so they don't have to live in hiding anymore and be able to flaunt it to the world.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well but they do defend it, we have at least one user on reddit that was proven to be a child abuser yet still unpunished, aka sarahbutts, then on the Allison Rapp thing where she defended it sjw's also sided with her, Anita has a convicted child abuser as a twitch moderator so... I mean there's more just can't think of all of them. http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/09/11/leading-gamergate-critic-sarah-nyberg-claimed-to-be-a-pedophile-apologised-for-white-nationalism/</p></p>

        <p><p>In and of itself, you are right, it doesn't hurt anyone. However, I feel that gradually normalizing abnormal behavior has the potential to leave people open to accept other paraphelia that is much more sinister.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't think they said once that gays = pedophiles. They may have insinuated it with the "slippery slope" trope where acceptance of "abnormal" lifestyle choices leaves our control (and lands in control of "SJW"s).</p>
<p>If we accept pedophilia, we remove <strong>choice</strong> from the child, which is the keyword. Anyone could just brainwash a kid into thinking they want sex with an adult when they really don't have the mental/social faculties to decide for themselves. But yet we see some of this in Turkey today.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I'm bi, the most internally-prosecuted of LGBT, so there, you have my bias now.</p></p>

        <p><p>Dude he's probably not a homophobe. Technically homosexuality is abnormal since it is not how the majority is, maybe that's what he means. Let's try not to call people racist, homophobe, etc and just explain how they're wrong or try to understand what they mean. </p></p>

        <p><p>I never said it was, and I don't think it is. However, my point is that normalizing gays was the first step. Not saying it was a bad thing to do, but saying that was not the ultimate goal. I think transgender-ism is also a mental disease (from body dysmorphic disorder) but people have become really accepting of that as of late, thus it has become normalized. Pedophilia should never become normalized, whether or not they act on it. You saying you are not disgusted by a pedophile tells me that the social engineering is working. </p></p>

        <p><p>you're failing to differentiate thoughts from actions. many people WANT to kill others, but that's not a crime. ACTUALLY killing someone is. wanting to sleep with children is a mental disposition that you can't help. actually sleeping with them is a crime. don't get the two confused</p></p>

        <p><p>Creating pity for people who want to rape children is the first step in getting people to see them as "human" and accepting them. That is what I believe. You are welcome to disagree.</p></p>

        <p><p>I like that quote. But that could also be interpreted as it's more so based on where your lowest citizens are, not that if they're all rapists or something and you're not judging them it somehow makes it better.. however I see you're referring to him calling them not human, which in that case I agree, isn't right </p></p>

        <p><p>no it's not. they ARE human. any one of us could have been born a pedophile (including you, it's all just brain chemistry), just like any of us could have been born being attracted to any number of things or people. </p>
<p>we can't help our attractions, we can only help how we choose to act on them</p></p>

        <p><p>This is exactly the kind of reasoning that the OP is worried about.  Not any one of us could be a pedophile.  Only the sick fucks who decide they want to fuck kids are pedophiles.  ITS A CHOICE</p></p>

        <p><p>no. you're getting a philia confused with an action. pedophile =/= child molester. people in this case are child molesters and they deserve to suffer immensely for what they've done. do you think homosexuality is also a choice? or heterosexuality? if so, we have nothing to talk about, you are about 50 years too late to the party and beyond reasoning with</p>
<p>if you don't think homosexuality is a choice, then it stands to reason that pedophilia is also not a choice. who would choose to ruin their lives by wanting something so dangerous?</p>
<p>thoughts are not crimes</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not getting it confused with action.  I am saying that this is exactly the reasoning that is worrying.  People are not born pedophiles.  They actively make the choice to lust after children.  This is a moral failure, not something you are born with.</p>
<p>Now that the public is convinced that people are born gay or trans, they could easily be convinced that people are born pedophiles.  </p></p>

        <p><p>They are already started this at Turkey it's not a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>They are making news about how normal marrying with a child if there is "love". They are making new law for  child marriage. And half of Turkey supporting this because this idea comes from Erdogan's Party. 6 months ago they were trying to reduce the punishments for zoophilia(i dont know how to spell this zooflia?thing with the animals). The peoples that have power trying to make absurd unthinkable things to look normal.</p>
<p>And I really started to think peoples in Turkey are just simple lab rats they are experimenting on us to see our reactions so they can go and try on the other countries or us...</p></p>

        <p><p>Jesus dude you're so wrong. You're trying to tie in LGBT with pedophilia when that's not the fucking case, that's why no one is taking you seriously. Did you even comprehend the comment I made above? Your response goes right back to "the gays". You're supporting the pedophiles more than anyone else at this point because you've taken their fake bait and directing your anger towards a completely unrelated group.</p></p>

        <p><p>Huh, I must have been brainwashed without knowing, i'm pretty sure I just used basic logic after thinking for 10 minutes or so though.</p>
<p>Pedo &gt; no hurt children &gt; no bad </p>
<p>Child molester &gt; hurt children &gt; bad</p>
<p>Your thought process seems to be</p>
<p>if pedo become normal &gt; child abuse gets closer to being normal</p>
<p>So what you're saying is, even if most pedophiles never hurt any children, they are still guilty because some might. That's like saying we should shame black people because if we don't, they will be even more prone to crime.</p></p>

        <p><p>sorry, but not really making much sense to me, if anything pedophilia is one of the few things that people always seem to have a strong knee jerk reaction to and wouldn't accept. I think its best to all keep focus on pizzagate related shit for now, and leave these discussions for somewhere else/later.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm convinced they use Hollywood to normalize their behavior so we're not able to identify the characteristics exhibited by pedophiles. They just use LGBT as a smoke-screen for their cause (like they previously did with manufactured racism). With the bathroom law, the real reason for it is to make children easier to abduct, they mask it as a transgender issue to pit the people against each other and hide their intentions. Try not to make the connection between homosexuality and pedophilia because that is exactly what the elites want us to do, they are playing a dirty game. </p></p>

        <p><p>I think having the world accept homophilia was the first necessary step to accept transgenderism. I think it would have been harder to accept transgenderism and thus pass the bathroom law without first ruling on gay marriage. Once again, not saying that I am anti gays or gay marriage. They used gays to push other, much less socially acceptable stuff by opening our minds to other possibilities.</p></p>

        <p><p>It doesn't really have anything to do with LGBT, the elites just use social divides to push their agenda, the pick the morally correct side and then use it to push their human trafficking agenda. You're going down the completely wrong line of thinking, that's why the other posts disagree so much. </p></p>

        <p><p>Complete truth, OP. Lots of people have been saying this for years but they get painted as hateful bigots or are completely dismissed as crazy.</p>
<p>Many opponents of gay marriage said that once it was ok in society, bestiality &amp; pedophilia would be next. Like many people, I thought they were hateful crazies but now I wonder if idiots in power (like Rick Santorum, for example), knew that there was more to the story.</p>
<p>Like civil rights &amp; gays being happy meant nothing, they were just pawns in an agenda to break down society, Saul Alinsky style.</p>
<p>Seems crazy on the surface but now everything does.</p></p>

        <p><p>You are correct that there is an agenda to facilitate social acceptance of pedophilia.</p>
<p>You are incorrect in your estimation of how long this has been going on.</p>
<p>It has been in process for decades, beginning with the Kinsey Institute.</p>
<p>This well researched documentary breaks it down, including relevant social movements and changes to the legal/criminal justice system. </p>

        <p><p>It's a long watch, but I promise it will blow your mind. It completely changed the way I viewed the "sexual revolution". Knowing that Kinsey used data from pedophiles - hell, he paid pedophiles for their data on child orgasm - was just the tip of the iceberg. The legal / policy changes that came about as a result of Kinsey &amp; his institute are an issue that we should all be aware of.</p></p>

<p>Stop using this to further your homophobic bullshit. You delegitimize the entire sub.</p>
<p>Hillary isn't even for gay marriage. In the mails she admits she lies just to get votes.</p>
<p>She also talks about her private and public positions. She just says what will get her elected.</p>

<p>homosexuality used to be seen as just as bad as pedophilia until the elites rebranded it. I myself am gay so i'm not comparing the two. Just saying, they have power. OP is exactly right.</p></p>

        <p><p>what does pedophilia have to do with homosexuality tho? Thanks for saying you accept gay people lmfaooo you're still a homophobe bc clearly you're equating homosexuality to pedophila in your head... </p>
<p>I do agree with you however about tptb and society in general normalizing pedophilia. The whole dd/lg kink for one... teens being the #1 searched for porn category... a general acceptance and encouragement of older men dating barely-legal women (or underage women... like the whole courtney stodden shit when she was like 15?? being everywhere), and there are plenty of tumblrs dedicated to defending pedos. And obviously a shit ton on reddit too. </p>
<p>Pedophilia is not a sexuality or mental disorder, it is a fucking blight upon humanity and all who practice it need to be eradicated. People need to stop shoving those sick fuckers in w/ people with mental illness.</p></p>

        <p><p>No, you are misinterpreting what I said. I NEVER said they are equal. my POINT was that in the past homosexuality was viewed as not socially acceptable by majority of people, but over time it has become widely accepted. Same thing happened to transgenderism. Now I am actively seeing people like that salon article trying to get acceptance for pedophiles using a similar strategy. </p></p>

        <p><p>I agree with you 100%. I used to scoff at those kind of ideas because, why? why would they do that? But then you realize, that's kind of how the law works here in America. Previous rulings open door for rulings that come later, it's called "precedent". Also, if our government is ran by a secret pedophile ring, it gives you the "why". </p></p>

        <p><p>I'd have to agree here, small changes are how they make big changes, it operates on the same mechanism as predictive programming. By slowly immersing you in the change, you don't notice it's happening at all.</p></p>

        <p><p>Pedophilia and homosexuality are related in a few ways, but none of those ways give us a reason to sympathize with people that intend to harm children. You've brought up similar sequences that have been observed over the last few decades or so. The premise of your argument is as follows (loosely so correct me if I make false claims):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Homosexuality was once considered deviant. Over time, it became more and more accepted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this lines up with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pedophilia was once (or is currently) considered deviant. Over time, it will become more and more accepted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although you've recognized a pattern between the two social phenomena, you've sadly been misinformed of the consequences of raping children. Let's not forget, raping <strong>anyone</strong> is not okay. However, when it comes to consensual sexual relations between two developed individuals of the same gender, no one is harmed. So let me sum this up so it's super easy to understand: Consenting adults participating in some form of sexual contact = no harm to those involved. Sexual situations involving one party which is undeveloped = harm to undeveloped party. </p>
<p>Sexual preferences have no place in this argument, as harming children, regardless of gender, means harming children.</p>
<p>Performing sexual acts on underdeveloped persons is physically and mentally abusive. There are plenty of ways that <strong>harming</strong> (pedophilia/having sex with children or any other form of sexual abuse) children can disrupt development, both physically and psychologically. Below is a link in which a study conducted yielded plenty of results about actual complications the girls involved experienced.</p>

        <p><p>I understand you have an agenda, or are adamant about your belief, but sexual orientation has <strong>nothing</strong> to do with those who are inapplicable of orienting themselves. These are children we're talking about. They lack sexual experience and development, which is what we use to orient ourselves. Disagree with me or claim others do all you want, but you're looking more and more like a complete fool. Stop derailing this subreddit's intent.</p>
<p>If you're serious about this, orient yourself. It's important to a lot of people that you have a legitimate understanding of basic social issues like this. </p>
<p>Either you're in denial, or you're a shill trying to throw us off course. Regardless, cut this shit out and get back to work/gtfo.</p></p>

        <p><p>yes, they are using the sexual revolution to normalize it. whether or not it is the same thing they will use the same arguments for LGBT that they will use for Pedophilia. Its one thing if your grown up child turns out to be gay or w/e and chooses that lifestyle. Its totally diff if its normalized for some old guy to want to date your kid and it being a hate crime for you to say no. this is also why they are pushing feminism - to create more divorce &amp; broken families from which its easier to take kids away into social services etc and leave them vulnerable and protectionless.</p>
<p>however, this redpill doesnt help us with the investigation and is best placed for /r/conspiracy </p></p>

        <p><p>Huh, so related 2 things and that means it must be true?</p>
<p>Ok, so these elites are spending trillions of dollars to.. be able to come out as pedo and say they watch loli porn?</p>
<p>The only bad thing in my eyes is actual CHILD ABUSE. Watching a cartoon isn't abuse but watching actual child porn is.</p>
<p>Am I on the wrong page here or is this sub a pedohile hate sub?</p></p>
