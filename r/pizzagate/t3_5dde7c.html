        <p><p>Exactly. I'm trying to remain skeptical, I really am. As a journalist I try not to just allow my wild speculation all over the internet, it's a tough call but I think this story is definitely moving away from conspiracy and into definitely something fucked up.</p></p>

        <p><p>If you were working at some pizza restaurant and hadn't done anything illegal but people on the internet were "connecting the dots" and accusing you of being a pedophile sex ring worker and if someone came to broadcast inside your workplace you could easily think it's one of the people who are giving you the worst name possible for no reason and could fucking kick him out. If this is all true I would love it to come out but this "someone warned them" kind of speculation is straight out fooling yourself.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah for real.  The fact that they're getting upset about all of this, denying it, changing their logos, etc. isn't damning at all.  It's just common fucking sense.  Nobody wants to be associated with that kind of thing whether it's true or not.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's still suspicious that their logos were that way in the first place, considering context.</p>
<p>I'm not ready to jump on this type of thing, but I do see a ton of coincidental and circumstantial evidence, and at a certain point you just have to decide if it's enough for you to jump in or not.</p></p>

        <p><p>This sub is going extremely fastly into a foil hat sub where even if there is some truth to be found or research to be done, they are being buried under "Oh there is a photo of Hillary with what looks like a sore in her mouth so she must be a cannibal." kind of shitposts. One guy said that the goat in a pizza place's logo had a triangle necklace where the animal has a fucking bell around its neck. It's terrible.</p></p>

        <p><p>seriously. There was a post yesterday that put together all the actual connections and "facts" that have been dug up so far, but because it contained too much personal information of non public people it was removed. But it was a clear concise outline of what has actually been found, without passing too much personal opinion on each piece of information. Clearly some of these people like Podesta have some dark tastes, and when you are in a position of power people tend to take advantage of that, so I am not ready to dismiss all of this. But people going full on conspiracy about any little piece of anything discredits the rest of the actual legit work being done.  However I think one major difference between now and all of the conspiracies surrounding the Clintons and this group of people in the past, is that where the people at the top could cut investigations and prosecutions off at the political level, now that all of this information is accessible on the internet, it will be much more difficult for them to just have a judge or prosecutor drop a case, or even worse, mysteriously commit suicide. If any of these ties, connections or facts can be proven in the public domain of the internet, there will be little they can do to cover it all up. </p></p>

        <p><p>Sure, the right course of action is open to discussion but we are not the (assuming innocence) employer who has to go through all this. He tells him in video "I know this is a joke to you but don't you see what the people are writing? My employers are getting death threats." so he is obviously thinking the periscope guy is one of the people who are actively hurting him, his employers and his business. It's his decision and reaction and it's  definitely seems like a natural response either way.</p></p>

        <p><p>I wish they would have gone in under the radar, and recorded their experience on the sly, a la James O'Keefe.  I think the results would have been different that way.  </p>
<p>Bottom line though:  Comet Ping Pong knows what's up. </p></p>

        <p><p>Definitely need more context to the exchange. Lets assume a situation of innocence for a moment, thousands of people are attacking you online about being a pedo and running a pedoring out of your restaurant. Probably puts people on edge a bit.</p>
<p>That said, I'd expect that fuck to be on edge if he was doing some highly illegal shit out of his shop and people were on to him as well.</p></p>

        <p><p>I dont think so.... this pizzagate stuff is compelling but that guy walked into a restaurant where employees almost assuredly are being threatened frequently, and then recorded everything that was going on and expected it to go over well?</p>
<p>Thats just a video of some guy harassing pizza shop employees until he gets kicked out. Whether or not they're doing illegal activity in the back doesn't change anything, he probably would've been booted from a lot of places.</p>
<p>Also where are you a journalist for if you dont mind me asking? This comet pizza video is suuuuuuuper thin to kick up this much of a response....</p></p>

        <p><p>He wasn't "harassing" employees. Asking where restrooms are and if Foos Ball was free don't really seem like odd questions someone would ask if they're never been there before.</p></p>

        <p><p>The two-way mirror was one of the least suspicious things, still a bit weird though. Place looked like it could be a front. Dude working there seemed pretty shady, kept going to a computer to text someone (could be orders, but they said it didn't look like that) and there were a lot of cameras, some facing inside. On the board, completely out of context there was <a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgeMcIntyre_/status/799079954793250829">an odd picture</a> of this creepy building with a ladder going up to a door with the caption "live your dream" and "if you want to live upstairs, go for it", as well as a notice that said "when you deliver pizza to this address, leave it outside and don't knock". </p></p>

<p>The street addresses go from about 3112 to 4130, so assuming those numbers were in the address (but not in that order), we can restrict our search down a bunch as it would not exceed 36XX.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well there were other tweets where they typed out the name of their business while discussing. There are addons on Twitter that alert you whenever you are @'d or your name is typed in a tweet even without tagging.</p>
<p>Or maybe they know they're on to something and are just making sure their own business is in the clear. They wished them luck even, which may hint at them always having a feeling that something was fishy with these pizza places?</p></p>

        <p><p>He said there was an address that was labelled "When delivering pizza, drop pizza on ground.  Do not knock at this address".  What the fuck does that mean, what are they really delivering, and can we find that address anywhere else in the investigation.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's too bad he acted like a complete idiot. I feel like he was too nervous, talking to his pocket, wandering around. Be chill son.</p>
<p>I wonder what happened between the point where he turned it off and the next stream started. wtf. It seems like they're hiding something but this is just alerting them that people are looking into what's going on there.</p></p>

<p>There is a connection between McCann &amp; Podesta, through a deceased Freud, I'm sure you recognize that name.</p>
<p>Clement Freud; yes that same Freud family line, met with the McCann parents in his villa. A woman named Sara Latham who worked for John Podesta in 1995 &amp; 1996, who is also on Hillary For America with him, also knows Clement Freud from working for Freud Communications.</p>
<p>Also remember the Freud family was close with the Rothschild family in Britain, Clement Freud was a pedophile too, his wife had to apologize to victims.</p>
<p>Found this on 4chan.  I don't know if this violates the rules, because it references dead people.</p></p>

        <p><p>Hi OP, is this an actual review of Besta pizza? The reviewer says the staff were acting strangely and thought they were hiding something: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cxb8UDpVQAAHqaV.jpg</p>
<p>I cannot find that review on Yelp.</p></p>

        <p><p>When he ordered from Besta Pizza and saw strange delivery instruction for an address he identified at 6232 Station Street. I looked into it. I found a Legation Street not a mile from Besta, but the numbers do not go up that high. I hope we can confirm the number of the house.</p></p>

        <p><p>I created this:  <a href="http://sli.mg/sqqwqO">http://sli.mg/sqqwqO</a></p>
<p>The street addresses go from about 3112 to 4130, so assuming those numbers were in the address (but not in that order), we can restrict our search down a bunch as it would not exceed 36XX.</p></p>

        <p><p>He couldn't have acted more suspiciously and obvious. From the talking about infiltrating in front of the place up to acting super unnatural while entering...<br>
Every normal person would have seen immediately that they are not just normal customers, even if they didn't have anything to hide.  </p>
<p>That spy game was pathetic. And the people working there are definitely on high alert so no wonder they knew what was up in like 3 seconds and kicked his ass out.  </p>
<p>I don't understand how someone can behave in such a self-incrminiating way if you do something like this. </p></p>

        <p><p>So Periscope says the video can't be played, anyone have a mirror?</p>
<p>Also, if you're gonna livestream, put your phone in your breast pocket with the camera sticking out and DON'T SAY OR DO ANYTHING TO DRAW ATTENTION TO IT.</p>
<p>If asked about PizzaGate, act confused and say you're just visiting from out of town and read their amazing Yelp reviews. If they ask to see your phone or try to grab it, act exactly how you would if it happened anywhere else. Tell them it's your property, they've got no right to touch it, and you'll have them charged with assault if they don't back off.</p></p>
