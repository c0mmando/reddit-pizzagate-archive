<strong>Critical analysis of Pizzagate, from an outsider.</strong>
<p><p>Some of you will call me a shill, some of you will call me a tool. I don't really care. This post is for those of you are rational and objective oriented. Those of you who realize that a public appearance of legitimacy is critical to organized action, take note.</p>
<p>This post is an attempt to reach out and explain why Pizzagate has lost its appearance of legitimacy, and why it is not a group of 'shills' silencing you, but rather regular netizens who are tired of <em>a very familiar tone</em> that is shared by (other?) fringe conspiracy groups.</p>
<p>It does not matter what your message is, how important you think it is, or how evil your opponents are...if nobody believes you. </p>
<p>Guess what? The hard truth is few people believe you anymore. I will outline why this is, with some points below.</p>
<p>Full disclosure, I do not believe the allegations made by the pizzagate group. There is too much noise, too much witch hunting, and too much actual-crazy. It is impossible to shift through the pile of shit for the nugget of truth. I am here to provide some perspective, based on my experience with similar groups.</p>
<p><strong>1) Roleplayers.</strong> </p>
<p>This community is full of roleplayers. Larpers. Whatever you want to call them, they do not investigate, they do not discuss reality, they do not provide anything except <strong>imaginary scenarios related to the investigation.</strong> Every conspiracy group has these. Members who feel that because they are not contributing in a meaningful way, that they are worthless. So they start making shit up. </p>
<p>In my opinion, an easy way to keep marginalized non-contributes from feeling useless, is to reinforce the importance of archiving. Let them horde your data for you, at the very least. They can feel like they are part of the game, and will stay current, in order to keep their archives updated. </p>
<p><strong>2) Actual psychotics.</strong></p>
<p>You need to get your crazies under control. Give them the boot, freeze them out, whatever. They are only harming your cause, by destroying your public image. These are the ones who spout of gigantic walls of rambling text across multiple different image boards and forums, and engage in insane arguments with random people, accusing anyone and everyone of being "shills" for the pedo establishment or whatever. </p>
<p>The hallmarks of the actual crazies are extremely alarmist language, general hysteria, sweeping accusations when they meet organic resistance to their message, and sadly, a lack of hard data to back up their theories. </p>
<p>They aren't convincing anybody, and only serve to make people associate your investigation with lunatics, and of course, to draw new lunatics in with the promise of a safe home for their bad behavior. Police them yourselves. Do not accept their shitposting. </p>
<p><strong>3) Squirrel chasing.</strong></p>
<p>"Twittergate" is a perfect example. No, sorry, but a bunch of teenage homosexuals in Thailand/Philippines/Indonesia  taking naked selfies, are not part of your global pedo conspiracy. Are these type of posts allowed on twitter? No, but that is a TOS violation, not a breach of US laws. Twitter doesn't filter them, because they don't have filters for the languages and slang they use. It's not a conspiracy, its just a bunch of teenagers being gross in public. </p>
<p>This is related to #1. The people who talk about seeing 'horrific' things, but will not provide evidence, are roleplaying. Twittergate is a perfect opportunity for retards and non-contributers to feel important, by having a circlejerk over "bad stuff they cant show anyone". </p>
<p>Let me also say that it is particularly evil to try and dox young homosexuals in foreign countries, since doing so might <strong>actually get them fucking killed</strong>. This is a witchhunt that has gotten out of control, and this community is directly responsible for lighting this particular fire. If a single arab teenager is arrested because of this, their blood is on your hands. </p>
<p><strong>4) Religion</strong></p>
<p>The  morons spouting scripture and trying to associate your investigation with apocalyptic theories, are not doing you any good. I have chosen to not lump them in with psychotics, because their type of shitposting is unique. This type of investigation needs to be secular. Anything else, and you immediately drive off skeptics of all types who know (rightfully so) that religious conspiracies are usually too whacky to devote time to. </p>
<p>You've got a whole group of clowns here who are trying to integrate this into their 'end of days' timeline.</p>
<p>If you want to regain legitimacy, remove religion from your message. </p>
<p><strong>5) Conspiracy-bloat</strong></p>
<p>Every time you try to attach a pre-existing conspiracy to "Pizzagate", like Madeline, you rope in an entirely new group of lunatics who have been salivating for any chance to tell everyone about their pet theories. Now you even have HAARP, MK Ultra (real but unrelated), and Illuminati assholes shitposting all over your subreddit.</p>
<p>They bring with them all of the above issues, except they are <em>foreign</em> to the investigation, and so you don't even know how to identify and deal with their shitposting, because it uses language you aren't familiar with. </p>
<p><strong>6) Alarmists</strong></p>
<p>Every time 'pizzagate' finds something 'new', a bunch of clowns pop up all over the net with 'red alert', 'happening', etc. People have tuned them out, because that something new usually turns out to be nothing at all, or buried so far down the conspiracy tunnel, that they don't even want to take the plunge. Fucking chill, and work on presenting a real story all at once, instead of feeding meaningless tidbits to people who don't know what the fuck you are talking about.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Conclusion: Pizzagate has the appearance of a movement that has been <em>co-opted by radicals</em>. It no longer matters if you were even on to something. Retards shitposting across all of the internet have destroyed your credibility, while you were hard at work investigating. </p>
<p>Solution: CONSOLIDATE YOUR MESSAGE, YOUR GOALS, AND CREATE A STRUCTURE FOR YOUR ORGANIZATION. Anything less, and you will be lost to obscurity.</p>
<p>For what it is worth, I truly hope you are able to produce some real evidence (IE videos/photos/DNA), but I have seen conspiracy groups implode in exactly the way /r/pizzagate is going, before. </p>
<p>Your group is in the process of being marginalized, and it appears to be self inflicted. This is a spiral of self destruction that many conspiracy-investigation groups go through, in the absence of strong leadership and clear goals.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p></p>

<p><p>MKULTRA is not unrelated. The occult is not unrelated. It pushes people's comfort zone, yes, but let's not even call it a theory because it's provably part of the equation. In fact, you're missing the whole point of why this is going on. It sort of baffles me that we're all here talking about an enormous pedophilia ring involving high level people and still treating some of these relevant subjects like crazy talk.</p></p>

<p><p>Yep. This is the true misinformation. When people try telling us everything is exactly as it seems they are trying to stop us from digging. Nothing is as it seems, that's the only truth one can be certain. The pedo stuff is only a part of what we do not know</p></p>

<p><p>I don't think I saw a single thing in this post that would indicate the OP wants anyone to stop digging. Literally at the end he's offering advice to fix what he's outlined as the problem. </p>
<p>The message of this post is: keep digging, but get this shit under control and have some standards. If that's misinformation or misdirection, then you're not reading what I'm reading.</p></p>

<p><p>I've noticed a spike in those. We do try to remove the fringe elements. Perhaps we'll need to shore up the sub rules/tweak the automoderator to remove some of that stuff.</p>
<p>I tend to agree with the OP that posts about topics like "I hacked this spooky website" are unhelpful and probably in some cases intentionally trying to divert attention. </p></p>

<p><p>Sure, perhaps some of them are actual deniers (how could you or I know?), but that doesn't mean the rest of us who also suspect the existence of a largescale pedophile ring are incorrect or 'crazy'.</p></p>

<p><p>At the risk of centralizing mod powers, might I suggest having all new threads be approved by moderators so we can avoid all the tail-chasing and drama associated with false leads? Cut off the nonsense at the source and streamline the discussion into a more constructive outlet. </p>
<p>There needs to be some kind of professionalism here, some kind of quality control to keep the investigation focused. Otherwise we end up with our wheels spinning in the muck down some irrelevant dead-end trail. </p></p>

<p><p>In considering that, I think I came to the realization that that's just going to drive the persecution and censorship narrative. There's honestly nothing, at this point, that's going to convince the crazies that they've gone off the deep end and I believe they'll do anything they can to shoot down further efforts if they feel like they're being pushed out. This place is fucked.</p></p>

<li>Queue all posts for mod review and deal with accusations of being compromised.</li>
<li>Allow the sub to be completely overrun by shills, trolls, roleplayers, and nutters.</li>

<p><p>It is completely fucked. 
I felt so relieved someone took the time to point out why this whole thing will go nowhere, put it into something that all these zealots might understand, but it is for naught and it was kind of predictable, considering how most of these things go.
The top post proves that a lot of people have completely willingly blinded themselves. 
I even get why, I wanted all of this to be real because it delivers a really nice and concise attack vector to established politicans, but of course it wasn't this easy.</p></p>

<p><p>You are also a shill that got BTFO'ed earlier. He's saying he wants us to find evidence implying there is not already a large amount of incriminating evidence. You were already told to get a new burner throwaway you obvious turd.  </p>
<p>edit: You and OP are so "concerned" about the revelations but aren't engaging with any of the evidence or actual content discovered by 4chan or this sub. Stahp. BURN NOTICE you snake. You were honestly stunned and said peace y'all. Hope it stays that way. </p>

<p><p>You are not the arbiter of what is ridiculous, no one appointed you as such, you clown. Again you are only engaging in psy ops dissembling, and are not engaging with any evidence. You are contributing nothing but concern trolling. </p>
<p>What piece of evidence from 4chan, 8chan or here (if any) do you find compelling? </p>
<p>Do you find it strange that adult, childless men linked to power players have been linked to barely-concealed pedophilic posts on instagram? </p>
<p>At what point did you decide your mental masturbation was more important than child abuse? </p>
<p>I'll wait. Though you did say "peace y'all". That seemed to imply you were leaving. You were stunned and done with this all. Before you even engaged in anything. And then banned. And then our magnanimous mods let you back in. You got unbanned. Why do you care if you were banned? </p>
<p>You ARE a shill. I leave to other people to decide if I'm being too rude to you (I'm not). BURN NOTICE</p>
<p>e: inb4 "alt-right" you're a one trick pony. Anyone reading this just scan this clown's comments. </p></p>

<p><p>You ARE a shill.  We all know suspect information is posted here.  That is not the point.  Half of the suspect stuff is PLANTED.  I woke up this morning to threads posted by new users saying Madeleine McCann was found in Italy or re-posting the stupid Olsen Twins pizza video, or bringing up Macaulay Culkin's stupid pizza band.  We know a lot of this information is not related to the damaging stuff, and we call it out.  You have spent the entire day trying to defend the idea that the WHOLE INVESTIGATION IS TARNISHED because random internet people post crap.  We are ordinary citizens with jobs and we cannot monitor this subreddit all day and call out every false thing that is posted right away.  I don't know who un-banned you, but they need to re-ban you immediately.  You are part of the coordinated shill attack effort today that started with the planting and upvoting of flimsy "evidence", following to the intrusion of literature professors such as yourself posting attacks on the idea that this sub has information like that posted.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm not taking about OP. I'm talking about someone following a lead and then being told that lead will discredit us...I mean to adopt that mentality implies that we know how deep this go. We are only just scratching the surface.  It's hard to believe for me that we can accept a massive child trafficking ring but not discussions as to what motivates the ring. I think they're should be at least an acceptance that this doesnt end at pedophilia...what evidence is there for us to say "nope, lets not talk about that"? It's an illogical thought process if we are searching for enlightenment.  Entertain all ideas, it does not mean me or you have to accept the idea...but it is crucial that we entertain all ideas. </p></p>

<p><p>Specifically how point #5 is "conspiracy bloat"... a pedophile ring is, by LEGAL definition, a conspiracy. It's a crime that falls under conspiracy, something like Conspiracy To Commit Child Trafficking or any number of similar felonies which could land someone in federal prison. </p></p>

<p><p>Sure, but once you attach the word "conspiracy" to anything, regardless of the actual situation, many many people automatically dismiss it. If you want your voice heard, you need distance between yourself and stuff that people already don't believe.</p></p>

<p><p>This isn't about the fact that a pedophile ring would be a conspiracy, it is about THIS SUBS conspiracy theory regarding how this would look like and that this Comet Ping Pong is in fact part of that. That is a theory. A theory about an alleged conspiracy, a conspiracy theory.</p></p>

<p><p>I posted this elsewhere in the thread:</p>
<p>When young children are tortured it creates dissociative disorders.</p>
<p>This is the core effect that MKULTRA and related programs used to make a mind controlled subject. There is a specific classification for the dissociative state used for the sex slave trade. It's called Beta programming. This programming ensures both the victim's cooperation (because beta state brain waves are compliant) and ensures their silence as, all dissociative programming does.</p>
<p>So if you're wondering why so few survivours ever speak (other than just being called idiots), its because this technique involves amnesia walls in the psyche that make recalling the events of the torture difficult to recover.</p>
<p>Its related because THAT's what it is. Very few people know enough about DID and its use in mind control so the obvious nature of what they're looking at in pizzagate escapes them.</p></p>

<p><p>More importantly, nobody will take any of these allegations seriously. Not unless the entire network is exposed and <strong>THEN</strong> evidence supporting it comes out at trial.</p>
<p>It's like if someone had tried to spill the beans about Josef Mengele's experiments before WWII ended and we captured him and found his labs. It's too unbelievable for people to accept without physical proof.</p></p>

<p><p>What we're really asking people to accept is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>they are sexually abusing children</li>
<li>that abuse naturally causes DID</li>
<li>that the abusers would use that to their advantage</li>
</ol>
<p>that's it. is that harder to believe than child trafficking by Hillary Clinton?</p></p>

<p><p>The "technique" we're talking about IS rape and torture. Dissociation is an organic, natural response in a child to torture. It WILL happen even if the abusers were not trying to create it, but trust me, they are trying, because cooperation and silence of victims is essential. Adding in the fact that there is obvious occult involvement, there's no doubt that it's absolutely intentional.</p></p>

<p>Gee, I think they've accomplished their goals.</p>
<p>I wish people would just use simple logic and wake up. If someone is suspected of controlling your mind and you don't bother to research it because it's "too crazy", you've just let your own mind become leashed.</p></p>

<p><p>There are declassified documents that do prove MKUltra existed:  https://archive.org/details/cia-collection?&amp;and[]=MKULTRA.  Unfortunately the CIA also destroyed most of the classified documents after an investigation was started by Gerald Ford in 1973.  Why destroy those documents after an investigation starts?? Suspicious, like something to hide.  Here is also wiki to learn more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra</p></p>

<p><p>Aquino and temple of Set connections to name just one. To be clear, we're talking about the methodology used in that program, it doesn't have to be specific to that one project. There have been several and the methods themselves are borrowed from occult origins through WWII era scientists. The occult symbolism that's splattered all over this thing is also evidence of that.</p></p>

<p><p>My first into to that program was the book [Acid Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_Dreams_(book)) which details the history of LSD. If I recall correctly the first recorded human death from the substance was from an intelligence officer who secretly dosed a coworker as a joke which led to the coworker jumping out of a window to his death. My memory is a little fuzzy on this and I can't find anything about it online, so if anyone has anymore info feel free to correct me or add to this.</p></p>

<p><p>One of the policies of the anon #OPDeathEaters hashtag was to basically remove all mention of the occult from discussion of pedosadism. </p>
<p>They believed that #OPDeathEathers was essentially the ultimate conspiracy -- that if it could be exposed, all other conspiracies would unravel as a result of it. </p>
<p>I think this is generally a good policy, when investigating this kind of stuff. It certainly seems likely that there is occult stuff involved. But then again, maybe the power dynamics of pedosadism is the root cause, and the occult stuff is just there to discredit anybody who is investigating?</p></p>

<p><p>Notice that the pedophilia is systematic in the operation of the elite's cause. It's significant to them. It's not just a sick hobby, they wrap their philosophy and art around it. Believe me, the occult dealings of these people is very real.</p></p>

<p><p>There is no <em>direct</em> connection. Going out on fringe limbs just means the whole legitimate exposure gets discounted. The only people you convince with MKULTRA references are the people who are already convinced.</p></p>

<p><p>If you want to say that there's no direct connection to the officially names program "MKULTRA", that's fine, but there are absolutely connections to the same methodology of traumatic mind control.</p></p>

<p><p>Agreed! I'm just trying to focus on the argument instead of airing out everyone's favorite conspiracies as part of pizzagate. I have a pile of my own favorites, but they don't belong here. We need more facts, less conjecture, more focus, less distraction.</p></p>

<p><p>When young children are tortured it creates dissociative disorders. </p>
<p>This is the core effect that MKULTRA and related programs used to make a mind controlled subject. There is a specific classification for the dissociative state used for the sex slave trade. It's called Beta programming. This programming ensures both the victim's cooperation (because beta state brain waves are compliant) and ensures their silence as, all dissociative programming does.</p>
<p>So if you're wondering why so few survivours ever speak (other than just being called idiots), its because this technique involves amnesia walls in the psyche that make recalling the events of the torture difficult to recover.</p>
<p>Its related because THAT's what it is. Very few people know enough about DID and its use in mind control so the obvious nature of what they're looking at in pizzagate escapes them.</p></p>

<p><p>Pretty sure George Soros is Sid Bernstein, this has all been an elaborate MKUltra effort. The Mandela effect is a hoax created by the CIA to try and control the "reading/writing" of our thoughts to the point where we believe our cabal overlords even over our own collective consciousness. It's all been an effort to create a devil's playground, this goes so much deeper than we're even capable of realizing because we're going to essentially have to unlearn everything we've ever learned to see what's really going on. </p></p>

<p><p>My take on the Mandela effect has always been that it's revisions to records..just a modern, digital age version of old fashioned revisionist history. I think the idea that it's literal time manipulation is a trap</p>
<p>You're right - this goes way deeper and broader than a trafficking ring.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah it's to create the illusion of "linear" time I'm pretty sure. Think our education system is to get us to think sequentially rather than simultaneously so that we literally never escape the nonsense web of thoughts they've layed out for us.</p></p>

<p><p>Thank you for your very concerned post, OP. </p>
<p>I found this statement in your post especially interesting: "Guess what? The hard truth is few people believe you anymore."</p>
<p>How did you come to this conclusion? Was it the NYT article about Comet Pizza? I recommend you go to Twitter and read the responses to their ludicrous "debunking" job. It sure looks like more and more people are taking "Pizzagate" very seriously, not the other way around, like you claim. </p>
<p>Got any statistics or something to back up your statement that "few people believe you anymore"? If so, I would LOVE to see your proof of this "hard truth".  </p></p>

<p><p>I wouldnt say I am here for the lulz. I caught wind yesterday and decided to take a peak. My anxiety quickly went up and then I started trying to verify the basic facts and it just broke down quickly.</p>
<p>Aside: What is the deal with this being occult related? Do people actually believe there are sane people worshipping the devil and going through satanic rituals? Devil worship (outside institutions) has largely been made up.</p></p>

<p><p>Religion is a good way to control people and feel a sense of unity. You can then direct your doings based on the religious aspect, because like I said, it unites people under a common cause. That's why terrorists use religion, even though they don't actually adhere to it. </p>
<p>Also your argument about sane people believing in the devil doesn't hold up, because there's equally sane people believing in God. The deity they believe in may be a projection of who they are themselves. </p></p>

<p><p>It is good to control people because you can convince people they are doing the right thing (while doing the wrong). Satanic Worship doesnt fit that bill. No one worshiping Satan is going to believe that they are doing the right thing.</p></p>

<p><p>Same. I used to live near Comet Pizza and would go on occasion (pretty good pizza, saw a couple interesting bands), so I find this whole story amazing.</p>
<p>For those wondering, I never saw any sort of Satan worship or pedophilia going on. Of course, I'm a liberal/cuck/shill/Honda owner, so you don't have to believe me.</p></p>

<p><p>KYS because you can't unfuck your mind.</p>
<p>The point of digging on your own is because everyone is unique. Everyone has a level of brain washing already and some are harder to break than others. We don't know what piece of info will be the key to dispelling your own level of conditioning, hell, we don't even know if you will ever find it, but we'd like to at least see effort. If you don't think it's worth that, then just stay cucked. Just remember that we were here waving flags and blowing whistles in an attempt to save you.</p>
<p>Not everyone has the capacity to break free, many people choose the blue pill. It's OK to be a coward, I truly just hope you don't become a victim.</p></p>

<p><p>I love that you assume that I will eventually agree with you if I keep digging. Because the more I see the more insane this theory gets. The digging is just building a pile of bullshit.</p>

<p>You have labeled and judged me as someone trying to make you see things my way because that's how you've been conditioned to respond to "conspiracy theorists" and you think I'm one of them. I'm not a brain washer. I don't want you to see things my way. I want you to make your own decisions and have your own thoughts because I'd rather have this discussion with a human, not a by-product. Also, I'm on record now making an attempt to save your mind, if you can even call it that anymore. I'm just sharing the truth. </p>

<p><p>I keep hearing this around here. The idea that you need to just look for yourself. Like the dozens of youtube videos and reddit posts that summarize it all aren't convincing enough, not because of lack of evidence, but because we haven't studied hard enough ourselves.</p></p>

<p><p>Studied what exactly? When people say to "look for yourself" it means that you shouldn't believe something just because some one told you to. You need to investigate and make a decision based off of your own findings. There is pretty damning evidence that the people surrounding this are a little off even if they aren't apart of an insane pedophilia ring.  </p></p>

<p><p>There is a huge difference between "a little off" and a satanic pedophile ring that involves many levels of government,  has kill rooms, underground tunnels, etc. </p>
<p>Is it really that surprising to you that so many people do look at the evidence and conclude that you all have narrative first and shape the interpretation of evidence to conform to that? </p></p>

<p><p>Well in the context I was referring  to; obviously more than a "little off". And no I don't think I implied that I am surprised by that. It is a given, really. I don't agree with it. I was just trying to say that its worth looking into. </p>
<p>The parading of "evidence",every time some finds something new, annoys me. I said something relating to this earlier; if this was a perfect world everyone would do their own investigations quietly without disrupting the lives of people who have not been proven guilty of anything. Who knows this could be real but at the same time it could be a huge waste. I haven't made a decision on what I think yet because there hasn't been an official investigation.</p></p>

<p><p>Well, for what it's worth, I'm convinced there is something big picture going on, involving pedophilia, trafficking, and powerful people, and connected to the Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p>I am not convinced that every person that visits comet pizza is a pedophile, nor every person into weird art, pizza, pasta, etc is a pedophile.
There are a lot of very bizarre things around these people, and the only one that I can't find a way to explain, is why they are commenting on each others instagrams using sexual terms, on pictures of children. I have a messed up sense of humor and so do my friends, but I just can't see any of us doing that</p></p>

The people wasting our time with stupid comments like yours are simply helping the pedophiles keep their scheme going for longer. It's not reddit's job to convince everyone coming here and calling us crazy that this is true. Use your brain and do some research, these people are into Hostel/Saw type shit they're fucking sickos. </p></p>

<p><p>Can't stop freedom of speech, good lesson for them to not flaunt horrifying pictures on a public Instagram. And the crazy boards are going to all be correct, because you thinking we're crazy is exactly how MKUltra programmed everyone to think. You probably think Kanye is actually crazy in a mental hospital right now too? He's getting tortured like no other for starting to speak out about this stuff. Anyways I'm not arguing, the veil's gonna be removed over the next few months, we've all been duped for a long time.</p></p>

<p><p>Eh, the only thing I know about that guy in particular is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraxinus">Fraxinus</a> 2197 sounds like an awesome name for a sci-fi novel.  Could be a shill, could be an asshole.  It'd be epic if CTR's email server got leaked.  Same thought for other shill groups, but I've no idea who they are.</p></p>

<p><p>You mean the <em>solid evidence</em> that two completely different pictures rendered from descriptions of the same guy in his 30's in Portugal is actually two people, the Podesta brothers? </p>
<p>Generally when two people have completely different memories of what someone looks like it's considered unreliable. Don't you see how you are starting with a conclusion and trying to make the evidence fit? The pictures are not of two people, they are two memories of the same person. That means that one person can't be two Podesta brothers. </p>
<p>Or how about the <em>solid evidence</em> that a Pizza restaurant has a walk-in freezer and people made comments that reference shows like Dexter and Breaking Bad, as well as werewolves? </p>
<p>Or is it the smiling girl taped down with the unbreakable bond of masking tape that he jokingly put on Instagram for the whole world to see? That is your evidence of a an underground pedophile ring? </p>
<p>Or is it the picture of someone adding underpinning to the foundation of their building as <em>solid evidence</em> of tunnels linking all the pedophile businesses in the area?</p>
<p>Or is it the logos that vaguely resemble pedophile symbols on a document that originated from wikileaks but has no other FBI corroboration? </p>
<p>Ah, I got it. It's cheese pizza. That's the solid evidence. </p></p>

<p><p>There are obviously people posting crazy shit on here so they can screenshot it in order to discredit the sub and have people like you dismiss us as "tin-foil whackos". Any person who diasagrees that there is a national pedophile ring could post anything they wanted on here in order to paint any narrative at all.</p></p>

<p><blockquote>
<p>I recommend you go to Twitter and read the responses to their ludicrous "debunking" job.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lesson of the 2016 election is internet communities are echo chambers. Clinton's followers were convinced she was going to win, because they only had other Clinton followers are friends, they only listened to pro-Clinton news, and the polls screwed it all up as a result.</p>
<p>These are not accurate ways of gauging your actually general credibility or support. And when someone like OP comes in and shares something separate from your echo chamber, don't immediately jump to "That can't be true, because I'm seeing this" or you'll fall into the same trap as the Clinton followers.</p>
<p>There are not statistics here. No one has done those studies. It's not even reasonable to expect them so quickly. So the thing you have to do is what the Clinton followers didn't, ask yourself "If that's true, what do I do?" That's called a contingency plan. And not having one dooms your movement.</p></p>

<p><p>1 - "and the polls screwed it all up as a result". This is false and didn't follow from the point you made. At worst, illogical. At best, really poor grammar as this makes no sense. The polls weren't 'bad' they were purposely fixed to try to sway the outcome. It was a con job. Why did FoxBusiness say Hillary+14% the day of the  election? Because they know it's working right wing voters, who if they thought Hillary was going to walk it, may just not bother going to vote after work, with the queues and the late dinner. Psychological manipulation. They were the worst poll prediction and they were allegedly the "right wing broadcaster". Massively obvious ploy. But it failed.</p>
<p>2 - "they only listened to pro-Clinton news" yes - because the mainstream media was almost entirely biased and pro Hillary and this created unreal expectations and ridiculous anxieties. It was true #FakeNews. This means the MSM is at fault, cannot have a MSM which is 95% pro one candidate. The MAINSTREAM was the echo chamber - the Internet was the open battleground of ideas and debate. No the MEDIA try to pretend the fault lies with people and not their highly biased and sensationalist reporting?! "Don't have ideas or thoughts of your own, you are stupid, we are highly educated and manicured and work for globalist billionaires. Silly rabbits. Think what we tell you to think or your a racist"</p>
<p>3- "dooms your movement" seriously, what?! Your whole post is pseudo intellectual drivel </p></p>

<p><p>Lol jaysus you're going by the book aren't you? Jeje the last person who tried a script on me about lost her mind when I said... you can skip the psychobabble script shit I work on it (literally I do as I work on upper ed papers that continually put forth new ways to control the narrative)... now can we me some tech help? She took a deep breath and went back to paragraph 2 of the script and I told her again... just stop. Get me tech now. </p>
<p>This stuff is being used across all levels of society from help desks to television news... I'm guessing it's not working like they thought it would. Which fucking means in going to get a lot more of those papers coming in as doovers! </p></p>

<p>2) Actual psychotics.</p>
<p>You need to get your crazies under control. Give them the boot, freeze them out, whatever. They are only harming your cause, by destroying your public image. These are the ones who spout of gigantic walls of rambling text across multiple different image boards and forums, and engage in insane arguments with random people, accusing anyone and everyone of being "shills" for the pedo establishment or whatever.
The hallmarks of the actual crazies are extremely alarmist language, general hysteria, sweeping accusations when they meet organic resistance to their message, and sadly, a lack of hard data to back up their theories.
They aren't convincing anybody, and only serve to make people associate your investigation with lunatics, and of course, to draw new lunatics in with the promise of a safe home for their bad behavior. Police them yourselves. Do not accept their shitposting.</p>

<p><p>Without any actual guidance. Knowing what is programming and knowing what isn't means you've got to look at the entire picture.</p>
<p>Telling someone something that is true (shitposters) mixed with asshattery (don't mention Clintons) is primo work.</p>
<p>A better way to caution against whipping up over shitposting is to say..yeah there are larpers and shitposters trying to ruin this forum. How about deciding to wait the two hours the OP promised before deciding whether or not OP is posting truth. One hallmark of shitpost is they use OMG conspiracy (aka I can get murdered/I'm hiding out) and don't deliver anything...instead poof therefore it whips up the OMG frenzy again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sweeping accusations when they meet organic resistance to their message,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>posting about sweeping accusations (hello OP) and organic resistance (HELLO OP) while posting alarmist "don't do this or no one will listen" posts.</p>
<p>Is there veracity in OPs post? YES, we all recognize that. What OP is not acknowledging is that despite the frenzy we've been pretty good at not being fooled. We can do better. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a lack of hard data to back up their theories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>recognizing that insiders can and do post, but may not be able to give "hard data" is one thing...leave leeway, but don't go off the deep end...those posts end up in videos that are manufactured to make this place look crazy. It's a purposeful act. Knowing that then one is able to moderate responses...instead of OMG...it should be..thanks, let's wait and see.</p>
<p>The OP post was a master of its kind, literally, and deserves respect, as well as the correct observations, but I already addressed those in several posts but not as a big stickied post.</p>
<p>Alarmist language. Interesting that. I'm alarmed by what I saw Twitter disseminating, and anyone who isn't is fucked in the head. The "PROVE WHY YOU'RE ALARMED" is a sly "you're nuts/crazy/alarmist," and foolishly many people fall for that because YOU know what you saw, you know you're not nuts, and you may get caught in the trap of proving it. TO your detriment. </p>
<p>So while the OPs post has fair points it is cleverly crafted to include messages to just stop. </p></p>

<p><p>I am literally a nobody on the Internet who has led an interesting life, met interesting people and had interesting experiences. One aspect of my life has indeed put me into connection with certain forms of programming, but I also work in EdPub and I get to read a whole lot of shit before it goes anywhere...like an in-depth analysis of the TPP which had was so nasty that I was like WTF? KILL IT WITH FIRE&gt;..then Trump...I have read papers on Common Core, I was actually working on a college text due to be published Nov. 8th that had a lovely feature on our first female president.</p>
<p>It's just a fact of being intelligent and having a front seat to things due to circumstances of my life. I'm no body, I have no websites, do nothing professionally with this knowledge, but I do speak out when I see it. I'm a nobody with connections that just happened by nature of my character and the curious life I have had. That's all. I think if you take a minute to scroll through my posts you'll see what I mean.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah...that was a curious rabbit hole wasn't it? It is and is not a conspiracy :) how is that for balance.</p>
<p>EdPub used to be fun, literally used to fun. Then the creep happened..and it's worse in History and Government texts. That book I spoke of was about Gov. and was college level..so I understand why the snowflakes are such tards...but that's no excuse...for staying tards.</p>
<p>The Phd shit I have to work on is so fucking insane sometimes I pray for plague on colleges...LOL seriously..I read this and think..WTF who thinks this is a good idea...the TPP analysis was good...but biased..because I could read the TPP bits that he was using and I'm like...WTF Common Core Much? That's 1 apple+1 apple=potato.</p>
<p>Another thing is the socialization of language and I literally saw this one..I was schooling someone on the word nationalism last week and quoted websters to help sort the person out...yesterday I did the same thing and the fucking definition had literally been changed. Socialized language makes communication difficult..soon orange will mean fruit...and we're going to end up a fucking tower of babel again..unable to effectively communicate...which seems to be the plan. We are literally turning into an IDIOCRACY right in front of my eyes. Watch that movie...and see what you think :)</p>
<p>Happy trails! They tried to bait me all day yesterday because while I'm a nobody, I'm a nobody with a voice who knows shit :D </p></p>

<p>Excellent work.</p>
<p>No, the reason they believed Clinton would win is because there was a conspiracy (as discovered in the Wikiemails) among the media to drive the discussion. That very public discussion did not include any alternative voices that were not shouted down. Which was a global plan to drive the narrative. Stop blaming the stupid snowflakes for believing world media...their disillusion was solely driven and fed by a globalist media with their own agenda. The poor sods are still being driven although many have gotten off the bus, the only way to change the global narrative is to tell it to BTFO and STFU lying on a world stage. Thank you President Trump.</p></p>

<p><p>Kanye has been using his concerts to lecture about the fact that the MSM is full of lies and that facebook and google manipulate results to influence peoples attitudes and opinions. He says people need to open their eyes and see the truth... Then cancelled all his concerts... and now he was cuffed to a gurney and taken off to the loony bin. </p>
<p>Getting redpilled hurts when you realize you are in the middle of the viper's nest... and some of those you trusted are satanists... especially when you one of the few major artists that believes in God. </p></p>

<p><p>Kanye went from leaving the country because of Trump to being Trumps #2 fan overnight. He's clearly not 100% stable. Sure its possible for him to come around and decide he does like trump, but that's not what happened, he went from saying he it's the end of america to he's always supported trump and hes gonna save us all. To claim kanye got "redpilled" is nonsensical. </p></p>

<p><p>So you think he deep down truly supported Trump but chose to give money only to Hillary and the DNC? Kanye has in the past gone on tirades that showed signs of trouble deep down. He's a troubled man, its why not many on the right or left side like him.</p></p>

<p><p>I don't follow Kanye and his career... but I know that anyone the MSM has painted as "troubled" or "unstable" is usually because they are trying to discredit them... so no one believes the truth when they hear it out of their mouths. </p>
<p>Maybe he had been drinking the Kool-aid (technically Flavor-Aide) his whole life... and then spirit cooking hit twitter and he realized all those weird things he wrote off in the past really meant something more sinister... he would have been right in the middle of it and oblivious, till he got redpilled... </p></p>

<p><p>The satanism goes way back... Just google "Ted Gunderson" and you will see that pizza is a very small slice of the pie (pun intended).</p>
<p>Kanye has definitely been upset with Jay-Z lately... who has been linked with all the spirit cooking stuff. </p></p>

<p><p>Yeah but from what I can see Jay-z's relationship to Spirit Cooking is via Marina Ambromavic, the well known performance artist, who's work coincidentally has among other things dealt critically with institutions and power structures in the art world and the greater world at large.  </p>
<p>Again the whole thing just seems like a pretty blind reaction to art.  It's not satanism... it's art.  </p></p>

<p><p>Yeah... but you gotta figure Kayne and Jay-Z prolly go to a lot of the same parties/events... maybe Kanye has seen a bunch of subtly weird stuff that he dismissed due to confirmation bias... and then "spirit cooking" opened his eyes and allowed him to connect the dots the correct way. </p>

<p><p>This would be valid except for one thing. In her AMA she was asked about the occult in art, to which she responded the functionality is dependent on the intent.  If you are in an art museum, it's art. If you are in your home, in private, it can be something else. That was her answer. </p></p>

<p><p>Apparently, he was suffering from severe insomnia?  Doesn't seem like a valid reason to handcuff someone to the hospital to me.</p>
<p>If the diagnosis wasn't "for public consumption", perhaps Kanye spent too much time tracing leads at midnight!</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah I read the transcript of Kayne's thing. He didn't mention it, but he did call out MSM and say they were lying to us, which is pretty accurate in my opinion. </p>
<p>What I don't understand, is that he's been ranting about shit for a decade and then he calls out the media and the powers that be, and suddenly he hauled off to a hospital for "sleep deprivation".<br/>
Tin foil or not, that seems odd to me</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah. I'm trying to not be all "illuminati!" about it, but it strikes me as odd that he's universally known for his outbursts and rants, and no one seems to have ever (seriously) questioned his sanity.</p>
<p>He calls out MSM, JayZ, Beyonce, and 24 hours later he's handcuffed and taken to pysch? That's very strange
Also, i googled for "kayne handcuffed" and everything seems to say "reportedly" or "reports claiming". so who knows.</p></p>

<p>This is why those "people" come here to post. Expecting people who have not had experience with posts of this nature to recognize it for what it is, is unfair, however it is personal responsibility for those who do fly out the window so to speak, to fucking reign themselves in. Those people know who they are. And those recognizing the shit need to speak up more but in a calm explanatory way. You an see how I did that by looking over my posts in this forum...and then copy that style and utilize it. If we start doing that, we're going to be one dangerous unstoppable force to be dealt with.</p></p>

<p><p>If this was Roswald UFO post #1014323 the NYT wouldn't be writing about it and completely glossing over any of the actually disturbing stuff that's been found.  MSM reports on sex scandals usually but this is being completely ignored except for reddit.  It warrants further investigation and people are clearly interested in it given the number of subscribers and people active on the sub.</p></p>

<p><p>Exactly. I was stunned to see the NYT actually respond to this. The usual top level response is to inject the argument with insanity and let it die on its own. That they responded says a lot..and we will be getting a LOT more shitposts and insanity. Each of us has to make a personal agreement to remain dedicated but skeptical.</p>
<p>Fact..the ONLY thing missing to finish connecting the Podesta/Maddy links...is his flight log...literally that's all. So I will expect a false log to be leaked which will confuse the issue should the real one be leaked. But know this..gov. agencies absolutely know if Podesta was out of the country and where. So the best we can do at this point is say, damn we're only missing this....and let it lay stinking for everyone to see. There really isn't much more digging on that..the dots are laid...and only official channels can confirm or deny at this point.</p></p>

<p><p>I do not need actual evidence. There is enough smoke and there IS fire, and global connections. The evidence to seal the deal is in gov. hands and I trust will be dealt with in time. There are literally HUNDREDS of blackmailable pedos in the pentagon as exposed here</p>
<p>http://voices.washingtonpost.com/federal-eye/2010/07/pentagon_workers_tied_to_child.html</p>
<p>The attempt to guide the narrative by people either tricked into it or taught how to do it, by doing it for the lulz or pretending to do it for the lulz...this time...it's not going to work to shut it down, shut it up. I hope people DO become less panic oriented as I've made clear in my posts. When I see fake news posted here I message the person and point it out...no need to go on a wild rant because most people aren't doing it maliciously.</p>
<p>there are people on the right side of things as well..who maybe haven't had much of a voice since the insane were running the assylum. I see enough based on my critical examination of the dots and my personal knowledge, to be willing to wait until Trump takes office to see if this last link isn't exposed. I do believe the link is there, I have personal reasons for believing they are guilty and Maddy was taken more as punishment/power play...that being said, those are personal, and I certainly wouldn't be writing an expose screaming OMG Smoking GUN (in my head) articles.</p>
<p>There are a few people who have disappeared...that their families are not screaming on national news,  makes me think some fun things. I'm willing to be patient at the same time I also found out more nefarious things about FB and I am HYSTERICALLY telling people to get photos of their kids off the Internet...that's about the upper limit of my hysteria.</p></p>

<p><p>I just heard about pizzagate today, and I assumed it was a joke. I spent about 20 minutes reading posts here, all the time thinking this was ridiculous satire making fun of the kind of absurd conspiracy theories people have been spreading. Even as I am typing this comment I find it hard to believe that there is an actual community of people crazy enough to spout this nonsense as if it were real. Yes, it is absolutely true that few people believe you. Few people even think you are for real, because it is horrifying to think that there is a significant number of people in the world who can be taken in by such obvious nonsense.  </p>
<p>I suspect a significant number of your subscribers are only here to watching this trainwreck of insanity unfold on its own, and maybe fan the flames a little for some shits and giggles. </p></p>

<p><p>I dropped out of some pizzagate research I was doing because people kept quoting the bible at me. I'm not going to put up with that. So count me in the camp of "true believers" who aren't putting up with this crap.</p></p>

<p><p>Posted this below and I think it should also be said: </p>
<p>Why is Twittergate related to this? (put on this post) I don't know the rest, but I do know about Twittergate. I saw it first hand when it was being talked about on 4chan. It wasn't just young teenagers posting naked pictures of themselves. There is whole Twitter accounts with actual Childporn, from toddlers all the way to teenagers that looked aged 16-17. The accounts were talking about young children, some just seemed like what you said, but a lot were clearly child love Twitter accounts. </p>
<p>Not only that but most of them had hundreds or thousands of followers, and a few 10 thousand +. </p>
<p>I understand why the guy retweeting got banned. I do. However what I don't understand is why none of these other accounts have been banned? Especially the ones with thousands of followers. There is no way that they haven't been reported at least once. Not one time? And a lot of these accounts have been up for YEARS. Not only that, but a lot of the accounts were Arabic and other languages, but some were English. </p>
<p>Also, another problem is, a lot of the accounts are still up. After some publicity a lot has been banned (thank god), but there are still some up, from what I've been reading. So, questions need to be asked and answered. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why hasn't this been dealt with for years? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did they get reports or not? Evidence of that many followers suggest, yes they probably were at the very least once. If not show us proof. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they did get reports did they ignore those reports, or does something need to be fixed on Twitter? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they did ignore these reports and allow CP to just be posted and not care, what are the legal consequences?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is legal consequences, how do we make sure that they get in trouble fro this so it doesn't happen again?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I do agree with all of this needing to be more organized, and stuff being posted with facts, ect. However Twittergate should not be on this list. I think it's appropriate to post it here, and I also hope it gets it's own sub to be looked into. </p></p>

<p><blockquote>

<p>This is true...but wait, there's more! As I explained on a different thread yesterday? this technique is called injection.</p>
<p>Post 9/11 there were a LOT of really valid questions. I myself was thinking WTF? after listening to the NORAD tapes of that day...what happened was..people were starting to think..."say Floyd, that there question is valid, let's think about it" and then what happened? The "truth" forums were literally overran by people with bombshells, and insider information...such as "there were no planes"...there were weak minds that followed the well-crafted fake evidence and pretty soon the valid questions were completely drowned out...by the absolutely insane, and therefore people like Floyd or Martha or Joe Midwest who came to figure out if they needed to ask more questions...saw that shit...and ran for the hills.</p>
<p>Soon the voices of the conspiratards drowned out the valid questions and the whole idea of seeking truth got lost in the fake shit. </p></p>

<p><p>It'd be nice if I could get rid of all the BOMBSHELL posts.  It's just not a great way to frame evidence.  Probably not an available service, though.</p>
<p>Bombshells on conspiracy subs are like artillery bombardments in real world warfare.  It's hard to see through the fog of war, and many of the shells land on the buildings adjacent instead of your target.</p></p>

<p><p>They may be wrong about the Twitter porn, but the other points they make should be taken into consideration. I check this sub occasionally, and I agree you could improve your image with a few changes. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don't use all caps or "Breaking!" or "Emergency!!!" In every single title. Just state the facts of what you found, if it's important, it'll get upvoted accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to restrain yourselves from jumping to conclusions. There are certainly enough people here approaching things with a critical eye, but it's always the comments jumping to conclusions that get upvoted. Be skeptical of everything at first. Doesn't mean it shouldn't be investigated - you have to follow leads in order to discover new stuff, but there will be plenty of dead ends that lead to innocent people. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: yesterday I saw a post "OMG GUYS I CONNECTED THE CEO OF TWITTER TO HILLARY CLINTON! HE'S A CHILD SEX TRAFFICKER!!" Read the post: he gave a speech at a Clinton Foundation event. All that means, is that famous people get other famous people to headline their events. Completely non-scandalous, and certainly does not suggest that he has anything to do with abusing, much less trafficking children. This is what OP means, when they say that alarmism turns people off to listening, so they don't pay enough attention to dig through everything to find what's factual or plausible.</p>
<p>It would've been much more appropriate for that post to have a title "Twitter CEO once gave a speech for the Clinton Foundation. Help me figure out if this connection needs further investigation."</p></p>

<p><p>ya but he has a point because the porn was made public on here before twitter could really go check it out and remove it. Posts were flaring up and people were linking the accounts. Accounts with CP. </p>
<p>There's DAMN GOOD REASON they lock that shit down. Those pictures shouldn't exist in the first place and should be seen by as few people as possible. On top of how pure disgusting it is, if those pics end up circulating they can have very real, long lasting effects on that person's life. People who were abused should have the right to choose to be public about it and we need to have respect for these people and their lives, they're not just 'evidence'.</p>
<p>The lack of sensitivity that was displayed for the victims, showed how bad larping has got on here.</p></p>

<p><p>The fact this post is up there telling me my eyes didn't see what they saw then telling me to post proof or GTFO? Fuck off. I'm well aware of larpers and I think overall we do a pretty good job sussing out the fake shit. It's a process not a button. And I'm going to continue to report trolls asking me to prove I saw an 6-8 year old olive skin boy with dark eyes and dark curly hair using a dick shoved in his mouth while he giggled and wiped the cum off his face with his shirt. This kid has been abused so long he thinks it's normal. And if gay Thai and philipino dudes don't want the world to see their gay porn maybe it should not be in public accounts.</p>
<p>Fuck off op. The master concern troll written to manipulate. Jedi mind tricks don't work on me.</p></p>

<p><p>Ah...actually not watching...I'm pretty savvy..OG Anon etc...but if you go back and look at my posts...that shit got me..that shit tore me up...because I didn't need to go surfing the DW and I don't do that...jaysus not my bag for anything...trouble lurks there...but the IN YOUR FACE part of it COMPLETELY PUBLIC on Twitter...was...I had a hard day yesterday.</p>
<p>The duty to look..do we have a duty to recognize this for what it is?...I didn't look at the Twitter stuff because I was actually expecting to see what I did...but having seen it..I am changed. It's one thing to experience abuse, it's one thing to KNOW there's abuse, but I will never forget the feeling in my heart when I saw that little fella being abused. Not ever. In some ways..it's like...someone saw him who had sorrow and love in their heart for him...instead of fapping to it...I know that doesn't make a difference for him...but it sure as hell made a difference for me.</p>
<p>ANYONE attempting to devalue that child is going to get a verbal asswhopping, anyone attempting to MINIMIZE what I saw...same...anyone calling me a liar and telling me to PROVE IT&gt;..is getting reported.</p></p>

<p><p>Dude, get some help, I know what you saw is  pretty traumatic but it's not healthy the way you are reacting on here. It's not sensible to lash out and attach this abuse you saw to some random pizza place and a vast conspiracy.</p>
<p>Take a breather and get off the web for a bit if you really saw that stuff. Maybe go talk to a professional or something. </p></p>

<p><p>This. I posted this below and up top:</p>
<p>Why is Twittergate related to this? I don't know the rest, but I do know about Twittergate. I saw it first hand when it was being talked about on 4chan. It wasn't just young teenagers posting naked pictures of themselves. There is whole Twitter accounts with actual Childporn, from toddlers all the way to teenagers that looked aged 16-17. The accounts were talking about young children, some just seemed like what you said, but a lot were clearly child love Twitter accounts. </p>
<p>Not only that but most of them had hundreds or thousands of followers, and a few 10 thousand +. </p>
<p>I understand why the guy retweeting got banned. I do. However what I don't understand is why none of these other accounts have been banned? Especially the ones with thousands of followers. There is no way that they haven't been reported at least once. Not one time? And a lot of these accounts have been up for YEARS. Not only that, but a lot of the accounts were Arabic and other languages, but some were English. </p>
<p>Also, another problem is, a lot of the accounts are still up. After some publicity a lot has been banned (thank god), but there are still some up, from what I've been reading on 4chan. (People still talking about the accounts and going on them) So, questions need to be asked and answered. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why hasn't this been dealt with for years? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did they get reports or not? Evidence of that many followers suggest, yes they probably were at the very least once. If not show us proof. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they did get reports did they ignore those reports, or does something need to be fixed on Twitter? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they did ignore these reports and allow CP to just be posted and not care, what are the legal consequences?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is legal consequences, how do we make sure that they get in trouble fro this so it doesn't happen again?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I do agree with all of this needing to be more organized, and stuff being posted with facts, ect. However Twittergate should not be on this list. I think it's appropriate to post it here, and I also hope it gets it's own sub to be looked into. </p></p>

<p><p>Excellent. I was about to write the same. </p>
<p>My strongest points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control the language you're using. I know you believe there's something wrong, but the outsiders font, and this shit is <em>so incredible</em> that newcomers are more likely to dismiss it as crazy bullshit. </li>
</ul>
<p>So Don't use strong language. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Politics out of it! You will discourage half of the supporters if you discover who was your favourite presidential candidate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't mention links to Obama, Clinton or even Trump. Those links are thin, and those people are liked. You will only make enemies if you do. Concentrate on Podestas. They are unlikable creeps. </p>
</li>
</ul></p>

<p><p>And all they're saying is maybe pick a more reasonable target. Hillary could the ring-leader for an international pedophile ring and it WOULDN'T MATTER because she has the money and power to fight off or suppress any allegations. I don't think the Podestas are quite as immune.</p></p>

<p><p>This isn't chess or a game. Children are getting hurt. </p>
<p>We can expose them all. We should expose them all. Regardless of how much power or money they have. The Clinton's are very much involved, and ignoring them just to further our own agenda, is wrong. We need to continue with the truth 100%, we need to push their crimes into the light, and we need to seek justice for all the kids harmed, by all the sick fucks involved. </p>
<p>There's a saying that says "The road to hell is paved with good intentions." I'm not a religious person, but I think everyone can find meaning behind that statement, and I think it fits perfectly here. Ignoring someone because they have power and money and "we can't do nothing to them", just so we can push our "investigation" more, will be the reason this cause ends, not for telling the WHOLE truth, regardless if we get painted as conspiracy theorists or not. </p>
<p>Also you say: Pedosta brothers are easier to meme for their nefarious deeds, focus on exposing them first.</p>
<p>There is no reason, none at all, that we can't work on exposing both of them at the same time. They are very much connected, and finding evidence on one, finds more evidence on the other. </p>
<p>What is important is posting facts, with evidence that backs them up, and being organized. Which I think is an issue in this sub, and I hope that gets addressed. But telling us to ignore people involved because of how powerful they are or how much money they have, will hurt us. Telling us to ignore TwitterGate which is in fact happening 100% how I described in another comment, will hurt us. Telling us to not post stuff because it makes us sound like conspiracy theorists even if we have evidence backing everything up will hurt us. SO I hope that we can find a good balance between the two, and move forward. </p></p>

<p><p>She is a reasonable target. All anyone has to do is look at the Clinton Foundation and their "work" in Haiti. It's not OK with me if people are accepting of the fact that the world makes her untouchable. If, as a collective, we accept this idea, then it's reality, which I consider to be as close to a living nightmare as possible. If you only get rid of Podesta, the Hydra will just grow another head.</p></p>

<p><p>You make an excellent point but, on a hydra, the heads are equal. There's no weaker head that's easier to chop off. But if there was, wouldn't it be easier (more plausible?) to chop off that easier head? You're not killing the hydra, which I'm suggesting is impossible as a FIRST STEP, but you are making it weaker.</p></p>

<p><p>I would say leave the obvious Clinton connections in, but tone down the confirmation that she definitely eats young girls vaginas (yes, that's a real thing posted in this sub). </p>
<p>It's about presentation of the information. There's a lot of, CLINTON IS AN OCCULT WORSHIPPER WHO EATS CHILDREN, CONFIRMED!!! going on in here. Point out the sketchy Podesta emails, outline their connection to Clintons, and move on. Focus on facts, and allow everyone to draw their own conclusions, conduct their own investigations, and don't provide low hanging fruit to be dismissed as crazy conspiracy theories.</p></p>

<p><p>Good point, the disinfo campaign will be strategic, so we must be as well. Studying communications, PR, and the psychology of persuasion would help the movement tremendously. With stories like these there's a proclivity to appeal to emotion, but logic must be there as well. Sensationalist titles or wording will not work on a lot of people. Cognitive dissonance will be a barrier. Even though the Clintons seem to be at the heart of this, it would be more strategic to go after the Poedesta's and then let the audience make the connections to the Clinton's by slowly spoon feeding it to them.</p></p>

<p><p>He's saying its more important to establish they are in fact pedos in a setting outside of what the MSM portrays as conspiracy theory nutjobs. By trying to branch out and attach the conspiracy to everyone and everything before it's fully formed and established weakens any chances of proving it.</p></p>

<p><p>You're correct, he IS saying that, and that is correct...except...that pedos have much more freedom when they run with elites. Watch Open Secret...or the French (Eng subs) videos on the Detroux affair...pretty soon it becomes clear that there is an elite group that is able to control the message...it's NOT just about pedos and it's NOT about pedos per se...it's about controlling an entire group of people by blackmailing them. </p>
<p>There are dangerous pedos everywhere..the most dangerous are the ones IN THE FAMILY posting their kiddie fucking and sharing photos of their kids...this was my family. So I know about that..</p>
<p>The "conspiracy" isn't about kiddie fucking, it's about creating and controlling a governing system by blackmailing them. Think about this...what are the chances there were not hidden cameras at EpSTEINs island?  Just...what are the chances???? Once you let common sense take over the veil starts falling off the eyes.</p>
<p>This is about compromising people across all levels of society to ensure the safety and perpetuation of your chosen narrative. Who is on the 7th? Remember the "conspiracy" about the Shadow Gov??? Not such a conspiracy anymore..since Powell said "the 7th is pissed" or the FBI files talked about the 7th floor...and the Shadow Government.</p>
<p>The puppet are the pedos, closeted gays, trannies, cheaters,  thieves...anyone can be set up and controlled at all levels...cops, sheriffs, lawyers, judges...up the chain. In the end it's not about pedos but about control by whatever means necessary.</p>
<p>Trump is off script, meaning the collective OH SHIT he got elected...that was not supposed to happen. There are forces opposing this...I frame it as THE PLAN and THE OPPOSITION TO THE PLAN.</p>
<p>Hillary was literally chosen to be president. It was assured. She was shocked...why?</p>
<p>We tend to make things more complicated than they are. Podestas are pedos..they run in Pedo circles...and they are masters of collection of information.</p>
<p>Scientology is also a master of mind control and blackmail..sometimes I see something and think OMG that's clam shit right there...LOL and that group right there has a shit ton of blackmail evidence on gov. officials. If  the clams do it, why are we so naive to think that that's what the entire 7th floor is actually about?</p></p>

<p><p>I agree. I keep seeing "Trump will save us" and "just wait another 60 days". It's extremely off-putting to those of us who see Trump as worse and more corrupt than any politician. Politics should stay out. This is about elites of all parties.</p></p>

<p>WTactualFUCK was that? Don't use politics when politics is exactly how these folks got away with this for so long. Don't mention Clintons...because they didn't fly to Lolita Island, and Podesta didn't manage her campaign, Don't mention Obama who also used a secret email and 500 of his emails were scrubbed..don't mention Creepy Joe and his pizza bracelets, don't mention anything but what are clearly going to be the fall guys.

<p><p>I have a real problem with all these blogs and youtube videos saying things like BOMBSHELL PROOF OF CLINTON SATANIST PEDO RING,  DC PEDO SCANDAL TO TAKE DOWN CLINTONS, SMOKING GUN OF DEVIL WORSHIPPING CHILD RAPIST CLINTON PLOT, etc etc. Even if any of the info contained therein is good, these people guarantee that any remotely skeptical person (and all should harbor healthy skepticism) will immediately write it off. It's a great way to turn off newcomers, by laying a veneer of immediate and hardcore tinfoil hattery over the whole thing.</p>
<p>That's why I wrote this: http://aceloewgold.com/2016/11/20/pizzagate-clinton-podesta-what-is-it-and-is-it-credible/</p>
<p>Though like others said, you can't leave out the Clintons and still give a full and fair review of what's been found. You can't even completely leave out the occult. Some people won't be able to swallow it, but we need to inrease our chances by being more journalistic.</p></p>

<p><p>nit picking - have you thought about leading with maybe some more general stuff before you get into the email codes?  I feel that people have a hard time believing the email code words until they have been set up with the creep background stuff first - like solid verifiable stuff - The Dennis Hastert Connection, the Alefantis/Brock/Grey love triangle blackmail thing, the creepy instagram comments, and the Tony Podesta "art".  Then after going over that, go into the email code.  Just a thought.  I have no room to criticize you at all - you've done an AWESOME job.</p></p>

<p><p>Very good feedback. I started with the email codewords because I thought they were so undeniably strange, and I'm guessing different people will have different aspects that light that spark of "whoah, there really might be something going on here."</p>
<p>But maybe it would resonate with more people if I start with the Podestas in Japan with Hastert, then the Podesta art, then the codewords, or some similar sequence. I'll give it some thought. Thanks so much!</p></p>

<p><p>Yet another article that convinces me this conspiracy theory is absolutely worthless, and doesn't have a single piece of evidence. </p>
<p>Poor taste in art / sense of humor is not evidence of anything. A grandmother referring to her grandkids as entertaining is not evidence. A pizza themed handkerchief from a guy who is close with a renowned pizza chef is not evidence. A holiday gift of cheeses and being a poor dominos player is not evidence. A pizza places logo resembling a triangle and a charity logo resembling a heart is not evidence of anything at all, in any universe. GQ rating a famous D.C. Chef and restauranteur with serious political connections as influential is not evidence. </p>
<p>Seriously. None of this is even suspicious, not separately and not together. </p></p>

<p><p>Good! That's your conclusion, which is exactly the point of the article. To summarize what's been found and let you draw your own conclusion.</p>

<p><p>Maybe I'd buy that if your article wasn't full of absurd conclusions, unrelated details added for effect, unfounded statements presented as "fact", deliberately leading language, and one or two outright lies. </p>
<p>I'd respect a simple recounting of only related facts done in a neutral tone without any inference or extrapolation. Thats not what this is, because in that light, the whole thing can't read as anything other than an indictment against the entire theory. It's rhetorical and meant to convince people of something that isn't there.</p></p>

<p><p>It's an opinion article on an opinion blog with a very clear editorial slant, not objective news. So, yes -- it contains opinions and extrapolations. It's fine if it doesn't convince you, but all I claimed is that it's more journalistic in its approach than the other summaries out there, which it is. I have no problem with your disagreeing with its conclusions, but it sounds like you clicked it expecting a straight news report written by Woodward and Bernstein...</p></p>

<p><p>There is nothing remotely journalistic about that blog post. It's a rambling presentation of random unrelated items taken entirely out of context and filled with Wild speculation. Don't say "the point is to let you draw your own conclusions" when the point is to persuade people something is real.</p></p>

<p><p>If you read other articles on the topic, the tone is most certainly more journalistic in comparison. t's an opinion piece on an opinion blog; get over it. The point is to persuade people of the opinion held, which after reading, they can and will then draw their own conclusions regarding its validity. That's the point of every opinion piece ever written.</p></p>

<p><p>Haha!</p>
<p>My question is, how many drills have we had here? Is it important that people point out that something is not a drill? This started as an investigation of the emails containing 'pizza' and we all knew of the connections that Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein had and that there have been rumors of a pedo-ring among world elites for years. The Comet Ping Pong connection was a branch of a much larger tree. Now, all the new children are here. They do not investigate. They make up stupid theories and think they cracked the case. They make connections out of the thinnest reasons. They re-post the same shit that has been dissected and cleared over and over (He was born with that name, fuckfaces). Now, no one is actually digging except for a few people, and any touch of info that is uncovered but needs further research is buried by 900 posts about how 'we' are being invaded and 'great work' posts that add nothing. </p>
<p>Ya know, we could actually investigate and turn shit up with our combined manpower, but we are caught in a massive 'bystander effect' black hole. </p>
<p>My opinion. If you haven't dug up a new connection, or researched a lead to conclusion, stay the fuck off the board. You aren't part of this. You are just a freeloader and bring nothing. Actually, you try to push this mainstream, so all the info dries up before we can catalog it. </p>
<p>And if you bring up and common sense, you are CTR... fuck.</p></p>

<p><p>It's not just CTR now. This investigation threatens an entire set of global elite. The techniques employed here now are akin to what happened to the 9/11 truth issue....almost identical. There is a very teeny country with a nasty ass PM who employs an entire army of online psyops and they are very well-trained in NLP and other scripting techniques...also the US has their own such group, and there are hired guns for this as well.</p></p>

<p><p>Yes. They may not keep the name, but they are very active. </p>
<p>This is actually a big story not being covered that could use some investigative work. It isn't just false narratives being put out and spreading. They are put out and pushed on social media, and the people they are duping have no idea. </p>
<p>This is a Saul Alinski move, and the new way the Left is trying to control the people that don't care about sources. </p>
<p>Right now the push is 'Fake News' and Trump protests. Maybe they are selective on who they interview, but isn't it fucked up that people are out there protesting and can't answer basic questions about why they are there? There is a lot of chatter that the seed of these protests are paid, and the simple minded follow. Same tactics they used against Trump, and police officers. That's why a Dallas PD who was murdered is filing lawsuits against Soros and several other affiliated groups that pushed the false narrative. </p></p>

<p><p>Agreed completely. Lots of nutties on here who try to link things to theories that hold no water. We need to focus on concrete and tangible evidence. Lots of people on here who shitpost symbolic videos that aren't evidence in any shape or form and then other people trying to link said videos to fictional things like satan and god. Just stfu and focus on whats fucking real and what we can actually prove. I don't care about your god vs satan argument.</p></p>

<p><p>Unfortunately, there is so little to actually go on that's substantive. We cannot show that for certain that the coded language in the Podesta emails has one and only one meaning. Without that, they could be talking about groceries, money laundering, or fishing for all we know. That being said, those emails are truly odd, but we cannot presume much more. The fact that they like certain artists prove nothing, except they like shitty art. The witch hunt with McCann feels like I'm being led to believe one thing. </p>
<p>As for symbolism, we cannot say much. A star and crescent moon is found in multiple countries flags (Turkey, Pakistan, and Singapore to name a few). And people are making a claim that it's straight up Moloch. I'm an atheist, and I went "Really, this argument makes no sense." People claiming that hearts on adoption agencies websites is pedophilic symbol is such an outlandish stretch as to be absurd. If I'm not mistaken, the pederastic symbolism found on the pizza joints is based off of one document, of which I don't know the truthiness.</p>
<p>Then there's the pizza place's IG photos, of which some are odd but not truly anything I can say out of the ordinary.  And, they too, employ people to make shitty art. Saying that they are child raping, buying children, and such seems to be a huge stretch.</p>
<p>I think the OP has some incredible points, perhaps angrily, but as a community things need to tighten up. There are too many coincidences and oddness.</p>
<p>Here's hoping that the next batch of wikileaks dumps can shed more light. Ok everyone, downvote me.</p></p>

<p><p>The satan angle is played to whip religious people up. Rituals that may be described are done for one purpose..to terrify...are there people who believe eating human flesh and drinking blood empowers them? Of course there are...it's dark scary and very useful as a cover...I suggest studying more on the "old" programs that sprang up out of Operation Paperclip. I'd say most people are "terrified" or believe in the devil, so what better imagery to use?</p>
<p>There are groups who perform rituals who actually believe they work. One such group operated in Northern Spain for years...(oh wait..) anyway the satanism imagery is a diversion. That stuff is used to terrify the victims. Are children being tortured? Yes. Why? mixed reasons...in order to sort out how to control the masses, one must sort out the best mechanisms and ages in which to start this. Pain/Pleasure response is one of them. A nice balanced book to read about all of these one after the other is The Orphan Conspiracies...I did read that not too long ago and found it to be a simple non-hysterical but easy to understand factual look at these programs.</p></p>

<p><p>You're welcome. Because I read and tear texts apart for a living I've developed a pretty strong sense of asshattery. I've save major publishers from massive embarrassment by detecting in the FIRST chapter of a text I was developmental editor on...that it was not only plagiary, but the dude plagiarized fake shit...LOL so I felt that book (while mostly old news for me) was a really good layman's look into the "conspiracies"..one thing that I had never thought about but made me think..OH SHIIIII...was the reason WHY there was an assassination attempt on Reagan. I think I was too young and too busy with "life" at the time to think about it. But they do a really great job explaining things and it seems pretty nicely balanced.</p>
<p>Operation Paperclip will cause you to rethink what you think you know...about the "goodness" of the US...and the literal drive to figure out and control the human mind.  </p></p>

<p><p>I do think there is something to #pizzagate. I'm not sure exactly what yet or the scale but I think something bad is probably going on.</p>
<p>With that being said, the most troubling aspect of this community is the eagerness and willingness to accept almost any claim at face value and upvote it and give it exposure without thinking about it. There was the video of Alex Jones crying about the photograph of the allegedly nude child (which was censored) found on Anthony Weiner's laptop which turned out just to be a fully clothed little girl. That type of shit will immediately turn people away and it was on top of the sub for hours.</p>
<p>It's important to keep an open mind and remember that it's possible that there isn't an underground child trafficking/torture ring using pizza parlors as fronts in D.C. If you've decided that it 100% exists then you <strong>will</strong> end up being lead astray and confirmation bias will kill this movement.</p></p>

<p><p>There is definitely a large amount of people posting here with knee-jerk reactions that relate to nothing and reach <strong>way</strong> too much. Even with the more popular things floating around, I've found that it relates to nothing, it's reaching, and people clearly are only looking at screenshots and not reviewing sources for themselves and coming to the conclusion that there is no correlation; thus, contaminating the already credible evidentiary support because some fucking idiot got too excited. </p></p>

<p><p>I've followed pizzagate since it's very beginning, both on reddit and /pol/; the reason it started in the first place was the analysis of the Podesta emails. It is the picture named "pizza" with the two girls investigating human trafficking "miraculously" rescued from N. Korea by Bill Clinton, which started it all. The way they were "presenting" the little child to the camera and the comments by Podesta and co made something apparent: the use of a sinister double talk with terms like pizza, cheese, dominos and such. </p>
<p>The investigations of places, people involved, visuals (James Alefantis instagram for ex.) were made to confirm the true meaning of these terms. There are now mountains of evidence to support this, whatever happens to pizzagate.</p>
<p>Networks are complicated by default and the fact we citizens are making the investigation is risky as we can indeed fall to speculation or try to "connect all the dots" when there is in fact, no connection. However, I believe it is important that we continue as child rings have been covered up by officials until now (see Westminster scandal, Dutroux and Zandvoort, etc.). Also, the average citizen doesn’t want to face that shit. </p>
<p>We have the advantage of number and liberty of action. At worst we will bring out "secondary" stuff such as twittergate and have all the research ready for the day all this nightmare will come out (yes, I believe it will inevitably be the case; it is the age of leaks after all).</p>
<p>Do not loose hope; continue digging.</p></p>

<p><p>I guess so... He doesn't seem to offer any real advice about what we need to do to advance the movement... just points a bunch of fingers at everyone involved. I'm glad that you don't understand it enough to give me a synopsis either. We're in the same boat I guess. </p></p>

<p><p>So... just focus on Comet Pizza? Cause obviously they haven't been tipped off and cleaned up the whole operation... Case closed I guess... We can all go home now. Nothing to see here. </p></p>

<p><p>Wrong to think that Comet Pizza got tipped off 3 weeks ago and just continues to do sinister shit even though they know every nerd in the world is scrutinizing them? I guess they could be that brazen... but I doubt it. I'm sure they've shipped anything incriminating offsite. </p></p>

<p><p>Thank you, thank you, and thank you again. I think you're wasting your time though. There are rational people here, but as per usual, the ones that are the loudest are dominating the narrative and shouting out anybody that doesn't have the energy to deal with that kind of insanity. It doesn't even matter what the narrative is anymore, because this place has been irreversibly tainted. </p>

<p><p>Yeah, you don't get it.  This is an information sorting process.  The good stuff will float to the top and get circulated virally, the bad stuff won't get traction beyond this sub.  And that's OK.  Let it happen.</p>
<p>Look at the amazing amount of coverage that's happening.  It's breaking through.</p>
<p>Be smart.  There are only two options:</p>
<p>1) The people who run the world, fiscally and governmental, also run a huge pedo ring.</p>
<p>2) They don't.</p>
<hr/>
<p>We're past the point of "they don't" - which means any attention on the topic is good attention.</p>
<p>The problem is and always has been that investigations are muffled or not allowed to happen.  Let.  It.  Happen.</p></p>

<p><p>I don't think we're past the point of "they don't", personally. I see lots of loose connections and unrelated pieces of information shoehorned to fit into a narrative, but nothing that's convinced me 100% that there's definitely this thing that's happening. </p>
<p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and so far there isn't anything that extraordinary. There's definitely some odd things. There's the e-mails, there's the file servers on CPP website (which hasn't been taken down even though it is known about, mind you), but there's not much else. John Podesta might be a pedophile, but I don't see any evidence of there being something larger than that here. </p>
<p>Not even saying it's not possible, but I also think a lot of what's presented as the evidence that it is is rife with massive oversimplifications of how investigations work, intentionally misleading information presented or critical information being flat out omitted to fit the narrative. That's just not helping.</p></p>

<p><p>It's extremely clear that the amount of research you've done on this topic extends as far as this one thread.</p>
<p>Those of us who have actually researched it over the past decades know what's going on.</p>
<p>You have a few options:</p>
<p>1) Ignore it.  If so, bye.</p>
<p>2) Research yourself the many court cases, evidences, and allegations over the past 6+ decades, all readily available to you on the internet.  Then, come back and start spreading info that people can accept.</p>
<p>3) Admit that the mere possibility of this being true means the word must be spread so investigations can happen.  Then, after they happen and if they find nothing, so be it.</p></p>

<p><p>I don't think those are my only options, actually. I've done some cursory research on other cases like Dutroux, etc. I've read some articles and these things are interesting, and there are patterns. I think knowing information about coverups would and should definitely put someone on the alert, but not to the degree of hysteria that I'm seeing here. This is now a cult of its own.</p>
<p>As for 3, that's not helpful at all. In fact, all it does is make them cover their tracks and be more proactive about covering their asses where people may look. It's going to be trivial for them to remove the real damning online evidence. Most people that come across this will not have the chops to investigate this properly, and the amount of attention that this is getting is just making it harder for real investigators to do their jobs.</p></p>

<p><p>You're just not understanding.  It's fine.</p>
<p>But you have it in reverse.  You want rock-hard proof first, THEN an investigation.  That's literally retarded.</p>
<p>There is enough evidence to start an investigation on so many people in power it's ridiculous.  They can start by fucking surprise raiding the Bohemian Grove one year and see what they find.  If it's nothing, so be it.  Move on.</p>
<p>The reason the word needs to be spread is because authorities don't or won't investigate.  If enough people want them to, they will have to.</p></p>

<p><p>Baby doll, there are laws for a reason. We can't just break down the standard for legal investigation into possible criminal activity just because some people don't like other people's taste in art or the kind of jokes they make (some of which when juxtaposed with actual children are rather tasteless, I'll agree). This is the basis for all the cries for formal investigation. </p>
<p>What I mean by saying that all this attention is making it harder for real investigators or more level-headed amateur sleuths is that the shit that could actually be found and presented to a law enforcement agency as definitive motivation to get search warrants etc. is going to be cleaned the fuck up before anyone can get to it. Therefore, this is only to detriment of the likelihood that kids who might actually be being abused as we speak could be rescued from living life like this. That's honestly tragic.</p></p>

<p><blockquote>
<p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very true. Except, it isn't a very extraordinary claim, like, say, an invisible man, who has the power to make you live forever,  watches everything you do and loves you and you can't talk to him but he will communicate via "signs" and coincidences. </p>
<p>There are pedophile rings in the world. There are lots of pedophiles. There's evidence that pedophile rings are run by powerful people and have gone to great lengths to cover up their actions, like the catholic church. You are right to say that for this claim specifically, we haven't seen anything that could be called direct evidence. But to label this an extraordinary claim is simply incorrect. </p></p>

<p><p>I think it is quite an extraordinary claim that almost every government agency, all the people that work in them, all the people fighting against human trafficking and slavery -- people that went to school and/or are dedicating their whole lives -- are actually lying and/or are complicit in their higher ups engaging in child abuse, rape, human trafficking, etc. </p>
<p>It is quite extraordinary the breadth of the accusations that a lot of people here are making. I'm not even saying that there isn't possibly some truth, just that I think the speculation has grown too grandiose. Unfortunately, the relationship between the grandiosity of the claims and the evidence presented to support them is negatively correlated and it's getting ridiculous. </p></p>

<p><p>All of the points you make could easily have been applied to the Church maybe 50 or 60 years ago, and yet, it was the truth. I am mostly in agreement, there needs to be due process, but I still think calling it an extraordinary claim isn't very fair. This kind of thing has happened before and is still happening all over the world. </p></p>

<p><p>So, we need to straighten up, tone it down, and only discuss this in terms that the general public will find acceptable and palatable?</p>
<p>I respectfully disagree.</p>
<p>This worked great after 9/11, because we didn't have the tools we have now. People still had some faith in the MSM, albeit sharply divided along party lines. They managed to shut down that investigation and keep a lid on that ever-boiling pot. Now, we can do our own research and communicate with each other in an instant and convenient way.</p>
<p>This movement is a widespread digital protest; and (just like any protest) there will be outliers and some who are possibly mentally ill. The wonderful thing about the vast discussion is that we can grow and learn as a group. Sure, there are all types of disinformation. I have been speaking out on my feelings about the Twittergate [hoax, as I see it]. It's fine to be wrong. I hope that I am; but we need to stay open to different viewpoints. I respect your opinion. However, you are talking about limiting the discussion; and that's more dangerous than anything, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Sure, we sound crazy. Because this whole thing is brain-splitting crazy. There is no way to explore these things without going into things that your average FB friends are going to resist. I only talk about this sparingly, and in very low-key, general terms on FB (such as stating that we have no government organization to track missing children), and only two or three people will even acknowledge the posts. Change my profile picture and they all go nuts with the likes and comments; so I know they are there.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't give a flying fuck whether or not they think we are off the reservation. They'll come off when they don't have any other choice; and I'll be there to comfort them through their trauma. However, I'm not going to tailor my discussion, here, to appease them. This isn't about wrapping up a nice package to give to the oblivious public. It's about building a body of evidence to take down this evil system. I know a lot of people with mental illness, who have divulged some fascinating insight and prophesied things which have since come to pass. MK ULTRA is a real program, and they have left a great number of broken butterflies in their wake.</p></p>

<p><p>I will chime in. I see a few other problems with how this discussion is going. Seems many here take everything as black or white, you ether agree 100% or get called a shill or troll. Any mention of a possible dissenting opinion gets trashed. Even if they are things that are plausible. </p>
<p>Some examples are the dozens of posts about logos. How many of you even had a clue what a "pedo symbol" was or looked like before this? Probably not many. We'll guess what most people don't and when wanting a logo for love use hearts. The way this group acts I'm amazed nobody has claimed the American Heart Association is part of it since there logo and everything is a heart. Logos are geometric patterns and can be used in non pedo ways but not according to here. </p>
<p>Pizza... So it seems every reference to any "code word" makes it automatically pedo talk. Have any of you ate pizza? Hard to admit in this sub right? Because it's being broad brushed. </p>
<p>Something is going on but the over arching its everything, everyone, and every theory we come up with is correct is your weakness. </p>
<p>Pick ONE piece of the pie, finish it, find all of the facts. Quit scrambling down rabbit holes. On E you can with no invalidity show proof beyond a reasonable doubt of any of this then you can gain legitimacy. </p>
<p>Notice the reasonable doubt part as its probably the most important. If questioned with honest, fair, legitimate questions answer them in the same way not by calling someone a shill or troll. </p>
<p>I fully expect down votes and being called a shill which will just prove my point. </p></p>

<p><p>I go to sleep and you guys upvote this shit?</p>
<p>Look, I'm all over this sub trying to get you guys off of  hilarious  emotional and logical appeals.</p>
<p>Let's do a simple flow chart, so you stop fucking around with unimportant shit:</p>
<p>Does this post necessarily make me feel something? What is that something?</p>
<p>If the answer is anything related to being a fellow human, parents loving their children, poor children being raped, or anything similar to these, you need to then ask yourself what the objective of making you feel such a way is. What is their purpose for inflicting these emotions? Are they posing a call to arms? Are they trying to throw another possible lead at us? Jump out of your fucking boxes. People are manipulating you here.</p>
<p>Next, you ask yourself if someone is using a logical appeal. Are they providing sources for a given premise? Where does their conclusion lead? Are the sources they site making me download shit, or giving them some sort of information?</p>
<p>After you view the article/info pool they cite, you then decide the credibility of the source. Is it raw evidence like a video, picture, unchanged emails between public figures? If not, does the article or wiki page have any well known associations or common themes? </p>
<p>The lot of you seem to misunderstand what disinformation means and are quite sensitive to emotional appeals and are getting ban wagon'd into smoke screens, or are just assuming that the ethos someone offers you is credible.</p>
<p>I'm seeing a trend here on this subreddit - one that's obviously harming the integrity of the group. We're falling prey to basic persuasion tactics and I feel very confident about someone abusing the voting system. </p>
<p>Be careful what you're upvoting and don't let others decide things for you. This is the type of shit we need to ignore. Keep moving.</p></p>

<p><p>I mostly agree with the criticism.
But you are in the wrong on the twitter thing.</p>
<p>You see: if it does not breach law, why don't you demonstrate us that the accusation is indeed misplaced and most of these accounts were indeed from SEA posting SEA stuff with, like, screenshots. I mean, Twitter had plenty of time to suspend most of them but you are free to try. That's first. Second: doing anything with CP can lead to a swift sentence. Or, better yet, nuke any thread in which it is shared. So not providing evidence beyond guidance is the only reasonable action. You are free to think why viewing CP is illegal for yourself.</p></p>

<p>Wrong, the MK Ultra/Monarch system is a central node point. Pizzagate is only the surface. I appreciate your outsider analysis, but you are wrong at least on this particular point.</p></p>

<p><p>You have good points. These sort of things really get certain kinds of people to come out of the woodwork.</p>
<p>But</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bonnie will be
Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and
almost 7) <strong>so you’ll have some further entertainment</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A quote from the Podesta e-mails. Looks to me that those numbers are the ages of the 3 persons mentioned.<br/>
In what universe is 3 kids "further entertainment" for a get together of adults? Why are the ages of someone's kids relevant?
If you read that without context. Isn't it weird? Am I reading it wrong?<br/>
No doubt that pedophile rings can and do exist in high places, and Pizzagate could very well be true.</p></p>

<p><p>To me, it pretty much close to confirms pizzagate. If it's not what it reads like, how is it supposed to be read? How are kids(ages) some further entertainment for adults? What other context is there?</p></p>

<p><p>Very good post imo. I'd recommend not mentioning illuminati or MKUltra when trying to get the word out. Use the comet ping pong images and ask, why are they calling this a family friendly restaurant when they continually reference child abuse. Why is HRC donating to this. Why did HRC donated to Laura Sylsby. Make it sound as non-conspiratorial as possible, because unaware people can't get their heads round it.</p></p>

<p><p>You didn't analyze pizza gate at all, there was not a shred of data analysis in that post. All you analyzed where the people talking about pizza gate, which has nothing to do with pizza gate's actual legitimacy. I was excited to see this title because I thought you'd give some evidence against the pizza gate thing, but all you said was "it seems unlikely and some of you are crazy so it must not be true".</p>
<p>You do realize that all of your data supporting pizza gate being bullshit is more baseless and opinionated than the actual pizza gate allegations.</p></p>

<p><p>You know what OP? You are right. And I actually do think that there is a potential problem but you have identified several key points as to why most look at this sub and go "Really?" I revert back to the poster talking about somehow secretly obtaining a sample of Podesta's faeces and testing it for human remains.......... Yep. Because that's going to happen. Too many people are giving it the "BREAKING NEWS BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH" and providing NOTHING! Theory and thoughts. 
I will post something from an investigative POV later and see what others really think. It'll be downvoted no doubt because it will be rational. </p></p>

<p><p>Good post, OP.</p>
<p>I honestly feel like if this sub was moderated better from the start, it wouldn't have turned into a shit storm. When there were only a couple thousand subs, the posts and discussions were articulate and thought-provoking, providing worthy conversation.</p>
<p>It was the moment when the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e8zvt/tfw_pizzagate_is_breaking_thru_to_msm_as_we_speak/">meme's</a> came flooding in is when people started to realise what the sub was turning into, but nothing was really done, no moderation.</p>
<p>Now it's just a free-for-all.</p>
<p>Child abuse is very real, there's no denying that, and the depths of it in our society are, I think, only just being realised in recent times with the rise of whistleblowers, and freedom of speech over social network platforms. </p>
<p>That's why it needs to be taken a bit more seriously, with more consideration and maturity. To be taken seriously, one needs to act seriously with intention.</p></p>

<p><p>IMO, moderators were great. This sub has come under attack numerous of times and they have done their jobs very nicely. The memes were an Op from those of us consistently involved with this to get the media ball rolling. We knew that there were going to be side-effects of that action. What's required now is to let me ball keep rolling while we fasten the hatches and start posting and looking for more undeniable evidence.</p></p>

<p><p>I consider myself a skeptic myself, and I truly think OP makes a few good points. I have been following this sub for a few days, and I do find the Pizzaguy instagram and the leaked emails quite disturbing. My gut tells me there is merit to some of the claims here, and pedophilia in the upper echelons of society is not something new. However, the alarmist language used by someone and the truther-type paranoid rambling puts a lot of people of, including me. </p>
<p>What many of you call "fake news" is not really fake news - it is clickbait, pure and simple. NYT posting an article poking fun on #pizzagate is in my eyes, just a good way to generate clicks from their main audience. I am not saying the mainstream media is wholly independent, but the concesus seems to be that there is some all-powerful group of old dudes in suits pulling the strings. I think this is misguided, and it makes #pizzagate another easy target for the familiar satire of truther-type movements.</p>
<p>However, some of the posts made here have merit to them, and they are why I am still here. I can feel the allure of the rabbit hole, although I do not expect justice to be served. At all. This is after all, the USA we are talking about.</p>
<p>Also, the people shouting "the earthquake in Japan is a distraction caused by HAARP" or similar bullshit should shut up. I completely agree with OP - they truly alienate outsiders. Keep the discourse grounded in whatever evidence there is, and don't capitalize words like EXPOSED. I don't want to cringe in addition to being abhorred by large scale child abuse.</p></p>

<p><p>I completely agree. I'm interested in the story and would love to find out more info or help when I can, but if I get called a Beta, Cuck, or some other empty T_D insult one more time for asking a question, I'm over it. yes, this got triggered by the email dump and Democrats but you can't be naive, especially if you're on this sub and digging into this, to believe it's one-sided.</p></p>

<p><p>You missed a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pizzagate's legitimacy is tarnished by the fact that people are reading nefarious conclusions into completely normal things. For example, one of the big points of evidence in the beginning was that Comet Ping Pong was covered in satanic-looking posters and hosts dark avant-garde performance art despite being all ages. Anybody who knows anything about the show circuit knows that these things are true of pretty much every venue that hosts underground musical acts. Some of the emails similarly sounded like casual chit-chat that many people interpreted to wild ends, like the cat adoption email that sounded on par with how any middle-aged cat-lover would talk about their cats (even used "the rainbow bridge" lol).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People keep making connections that are tenuous to completely non-existent for the sake of making connections. It seems like a good portion of the evidence that isn't 'these people are weird and like edgy art' involves people who are connected to each other. Just because a few people in a very small and tight-knit community know and associate with each other doesn't make them pedophiles or guilty even if one of them is a pedophile. Like seriously, a high-up at the center for missing and exploited children hanging out at Comet Ping Pong, the most popular indie venue in DC, and being friends with the owner is evidence of a pedo ring? The fact that some of the people who go to those pizza places are friends with Epstein, like half the people in DC, means that those pizza places are fronts for pedo rings? Foreign low-level CP networks on twitter have to somehow be connected to pizzagate? It makes no sense and is one of the pitfalls that most conspiracy theories fall into. People draw connections and come to conclusions because connections can be made rather than because there is any real evidence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No doubt that there are pedo networks in Washington, but the people in this sub really aren't making their case for it.</p></p>

<p><p>i think whilst we might see tinges of occultism (and i believe that angle too) i think this can be made a credible investigation based on child abuse / mistreatment (as seen by their eye bags etc) and being in the prescence of people who really shouldnt be there (ie clear fondness for the young). we should be focusing on linking these circles to people with history of pedophilia. </p>
<p>I would say perhaps a seperate sub for the implications of this - e.g. occult side, illuminati side but at same time that might split resources and we dont want that. </p>
<p>in either case, we should use those as clues to dig, but still present only on the child abuse / possible kidnapping side imo. too many people have disassociated dissonance on this. </p>
<p>for example whilst not shouting about satanism, we should still see if it does link people to this etc. but shouldnt be used as the main framework to present this. </p>
<p>i think the best framework to present this as is potential blackmail and coercion of politicians and thats the angle that we should aim for.</p>
<p>once people get captured theyll start singing, the rest of the darkness will come out?</p></p>

<p><blockquote>

<p>Yeah, no. Besides the fact that it's literally 100% impossible to control what comes out on the internet and "consolidate our message", which makes your entire post pointless, you're ignoring that most people (probably including yourself) are mind numbingly biased against what they consider a conspiracy theory. The "regular netizens" still believe muslims with box cutters pulled off 9/11, orchestrated from a middle eastern cave, and building 7 collapsed from burning furniture. The shit just gets tuned out from the word go. Random youtubers mentioning pizzagate in end times videos makes exactly zero difference.</p></p>

<p><p>It's not self-destruction. You say you're an outsider, so take our word for it that there has been a massive influx of shills and concern trolls. Your post certainly seems to fit that bill, but I'll give you the benefit of a doubt.</p>
<p>Some of the people who have come here with the hellfire and brimstone and religious invective are clearly here to undermine it. </p>
<p>Also, one thing you need to get off your high horse about: if the general thrust of the wikileaks emails is to be believed, the occult is very material to this. What the hell is a pizza map on a handkerchief? Why the hell is a staffer emailing Hillary about sacrificing a chicken (underage boy slang) to Moloch? Why is her reply anything but "dafuq bitch you fired go see HR" ? What's with the weird fish (occult) symbol and 14 written on Podesta's hands in a photo? </p>
<p>Wade into the pool a bit further and take this seriously, otherwise do not complain if you are discarded as a concern troll / shill. </p>
<p>EDIT: It's also suspicious that you are encouraging us not to bring up things central to this entire criminal conspiracy. We're not using seances to find info. I wanted to dismiss the occult but people here have done good work linking what seemed like "everyday" high-level pedophilia and the connections of Alefantis into something far more sinister.  In the deafening silence from the entire establishment on this for weeks, people speculate. It's not on us to explain what the fuck Spirit Cooking or Moloch or any of this shit is about. We're the ones who are trying to demand answers. </p>
<p>It's also instructive for others on the watch for shills/trolls to note that this guy hasn't really engaged with any of the evidence, he says he hopes we find something... as if there is not a preponderance of evidence that should spur a proper full on investigation. People need to be brought in and questioned a la "newlywed game" so they can't lie. This should have been done weeks ago so stories couldn't be agreed upon. Apparently Alefantis' social network is totally kosher? Everyone has a couple of convicted/accused pedophiles in their social circles? It's really common for childless gay men to post creepy instagram shit about kids and call little toddlers #hotards? </p>
<p>OP, clear your mind and look again. </p></p>

<p><p>I'd add one more thing we shouldn't call everything gate because people will think it's separate we need to tag # Pizzagate # battleoftwitter </p>
<p>So people see our progress and as more information is revealed they see our movement going forward and having real repercussions.</p>
<p>So let's say we find the same thing on instagram, instead of # instagramgate further separating it we can tag # pizzagate # battleofinstagram </p>
<p>this will associate # pizzagate as what's happening and the battles as sources of pedophilia</p></p>

<p><p>Why is Twittergate related to this? I don't know the rest, but I do know about Twittergate. I saw it first hand when it was being talked about on 4chan. It wasn't just young teenagers posting naked pictures of themselves. There is whole Twitter accounts with actual Childporn, from toddlers all the way to teenagers that looked aged 16-17. The accounts were talking about young children, some just seemed like what you said, but a lot were clearly child love Twitter accounts. </p>
<p>Not only that but most of them had hundreds or thousands of followers, and a few 10 thousand +. </p>
<p>I understand why the guy retweeting got banned. I do. However what I don't understand is why none of these other accounts have been banned? Especially the ones with thousands of followers. There is no way that they haven't been reported at least once. Not one time? And a lot of these accounts have been up for YEARS. Not only that, but a lot of the accounts were Arabic and other languages, but some were English. </p>
<p>Also, another problem is, a lot of the accounts are still up. After some publicity a lot has been banned (thank god), but there are still some up, from what I've been reading. So, questions need to be asked and answered. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why hasn't this been dealt with for years? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did they get reports or not? Evidence of that many followers suggest, yes they probably were at the very least once. If not show us proof. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they did get reports did they ignore those reports, or does something need to be fixed on Twitter? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they did ignore these reports and allow CP to just be posted and not care, what are the legal consequences?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is legal consequences, how do we make sure that they get in trouble fro this so it doesn't happen again?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I do agree with all of this needing to be more organized, and stuff being posted with facts, ect. However Twittergate should not be on this list. I think it's appropriate to post it here, and I also hope it gets it's own sub to be looked into. </p></p>

<p><p>This post is shit, from on outsider. Someone who never used reddit, saw "pizzagate" on a meme somewhere on ifunny, and decided to look it up soley because i hadnt heard of this "gate" event yet. After reading hundreds of threads over a variety of sources, i can strongly say with piece of mind this is 100% real. There is way to much evidence supporting it. Way to many people fighting against, trying to discredit before it even gets to the lime light. Pizzagate isnt hurting anyone who doesnt deserve it. The people in question all have overwelming evidence against them. More than enough to be sure its true. Because it IS true</p>
<p>Dont stop the great work being done here. This is not just about saving the children. This is a revolution against corruption. Evil is in control and its time for good to take over. 
Good vs evil
What side are you on?
If theres any confusion on which side is which i reccomend watching a couple super hero movies. Maybe even "avatar the last airbender" if your really out there.</p></p>

<p><p>Don't listen, friends! "Crazy" is just a word the MSM made up for "definitely right and not delusional at all!" I heard it from the radio intercepts my fillings have been receiving lately. John Madden, noted MSM personality, said, "The public will disbelieve the pizza-gate prophets if we can make them think that the prophets are not believable." Sinister!</p>
<p>What sheople like OP don't want you to know is that the victims of this crime are in so much pain that they actually generate psychic signals that certain sensitives - some of whom post in this sub - can subconsciously pick up on. These signals are then repeated as Subconscious Heuristic Interregnum-Telepathy posts. Though the poster may believe they are making things up when they post such things, the Truth is that, actually, they are channeling the Jungian unconscious of humanity, and are incapable of lying while in such a state. Remember to listen and believe when you see a S.H.I.-T. post.</p></p>

<p><p>The real issue is the psychology that is at play in these matters. Aside from concepts such as confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance, which are largely at play here. One of the major persuasion tactics that has been researched is an appeal to authority. A large segment of the population needs this theory confirmed by someone they respect for it to be validated. It's really plays into our cultural and developmental conditioning. When ideas outside the norm are brought up, only outliers will honestly consider them. Do a simple thought experiment. If ABC, CNN, NBC, etc. started presenting this same exact evidence found here, imagine how many people would be converted. The evidence hasn't changed, but the authority who has presented the evidence has.</p></p>

<p><p>Your post is literally the first post I have read on this sub and I already wholeheartedly agree. We ALL want people to get punished for egregious crimes. You can only draw a definitive conclusion from facts that are beyond a reasonable doubt. I think a lot of conspiracy folks draw conclusions on what they believe is a preponderance of the evidence which is a much lower standard of evidence. To that person, a few factual things can be readily tied to loose evidence or assumptions which poisons their ability to draw a definitive fact based conclusion. My expectation for a sub like this is to be the moderator to delineate what the facts are and what the assumptions are. You cannot destroy people's lives without hard evidence and even still, there is a criminal justice system that has a lot of ways for guilty people to go free. </p></p>

<p><p>It is already absolutely certain that the vast majority of people find this theory too crazy to believe. I've had a friend tell me flat out that it's too evil for him to believe. He would need ironclad proof. We do not need to be considered legitimate to uncover the truth, and once uncovered, the proof will speak for itself. The theorizing and wild goose chasing is valuable because it holds the possibility of opening the avenue of investigation that leads to hard evidence.</p></p>

<p><p>It's pointless to try and convince "rational" people that the world they know has been carefully proctored by conditioning all their life. They think we're crazy because we see past that conditioning, when in reality they refuse to see things without that veil of "rationale". </p>
<p>I have a friend on facebook who continually laments about "America chose the demagogue", as if his historical references to fallen civilizations <em>because</em> they chose a demagogue has any bearing on modern society. Not to mention that the history books themselves, are a huge part of this proctored mentality. </p>
<p>If you truly want to understand pizzagate, first you must toss aside everything you think you know about history. Ignore everything you've been taught by the system leading up to now. The system created "rational thought" just so their heinous actions can continue without suffering people who won't stand for injustice and are quite external about it.</p>

<p><p>The opportunity and the problem are the same.</p>
<p>We have diverse people investigating pizzagate together. We have a common goal and a bunch of side goals. To sideline part of our people by telling them that their opinion is not acceptable is unfortunately going to derail the common goal.</p>
<p>I am Christian. I don't consider myself to be religious but I follow Christ and I think that would make others think I am religious. I believe that this is evil and I will do whatever I can to stop the abuse of children. I don't care if the guy fighting next to me is an atheist, a buddhist or a kekian. I just don't, but I will upvote scripture that inspires me. </p>
<p>So what I think the problem is, is completely different than what you think the problem is. You think we should mute any opinions that do not further the goal of taking down the pedophiles. Whereas I think we should stay diverse to investigate but have a more mainstream press team.</p>
<p>I think our diversity is our strength. I read some people on one of the chans say that they thought that Mother Theresa in India could be linked to the abnormal Child Adoption angle. It horrified me and I NEVER would have gone down that road. But if it turns out to be true then we have added to the supporting evidence. If I am find a link between pizzagate and Satanism and it turns out to be true then that adds to the investigation. </p>
<p>Our strength and our weakness is our diversity and I think we are smart enough to enhance the strength and diminish the weakness.</p></p>

<p>1) unsupported theories 
2) crackpots
3) anything not pizzagate related.</p>
<p>There is so much material already to go through. </p>
<p>The opposing poster prove his critic so tragically that it would be funny if this was not so serious.</p>

<p><p>Thank you for this. This is exactly how I feel. People should keep digging for more proof, but as it stands I have found nothing that convinces me. I've read multiple summary posts, looked at all the links, and there is only one thing so far that is a little weird. The email from the Podesta leak inviting a few people to a party saying certain names will be there and their "ages". But this does not lead to the conclusion that there is a global pedophilia ring. Who knows what other contexts the email could be talking about. Again, it is indeed strange, but not enough. I wish you all luck if there is indeed something going on, but please follow the advice of OP if you wish to not be dismissed outright.</p></p>

<p><p>Thanks for clarifiying these. I agree with the OP. </p>
<p>I think the moderators should be clever. Someof the mods are really constructive and try to seperate the shitposting-speculation and real incestigation. But some mods of this subreddit are really destructive and very biased. The mods of the subreddit should work hard and be honest for preventing the reduction of credibility of your claims.</p></p>

<p><p>Sorry, but I saw evidence for proper pedo stuff located on a US twitter account, which is now suspended. This was documented in the list provided by 0hour. I don't know if putting a name to the specific account is something that is going to matter, but koemylo was the name.</p>
<p>Still a constructive post, just remember that people did see some of this stuff on twitter that wasn't from accounts that are in countries with a young age of consent.</p></p>

<p><p>I would say another big issue that affects their credibility is the amount of brigading going on. There have also been repeated calls on this sub to harass celebrities to get them on their side. There have been calls to flood twitter, facebook, etc. There have been attempts to manipulate votes to get certain posts to the top of /r/all. There have also been persistent calls to bring this up in as many other subs as possible to get everyone's attention. The Hacker News thread was bombarded by so many extreme comments from new accounts they eventually had to lock them out. Yelp had to put restrictions on the various businesses implicated. In fact, just about every review site out there has at least one comment bringing up pizzagate. </p>
<p>Getting in everyone's face and constantly repeating the mantra that everyone "just has to look at the evidence" isn't exactly making you people look sane. </p></p>

<p><p>I haven't seen a lot of the stuff you mention here going on. Religion, HAARP, 'psychotics'? And needing to 'freeze them out' ?? I don't even know what that means, but you cannot exclude anyone from the internet, soo....</p></p>

<p><p>Here's why i don't agree with you. Every angle needs to be examined. I don't believe in the supernatural, but others do. This Pizzagate may revolve around them believing it's real, so that door must be kept open. Those theists among us have some incite into why they are doing what they are doing, end of the world or not.</p>
<p>Pizzagate has more proof than any other conspiracy I've ever seen. I've previously laughed at a co worker who would constantly talk about these types of things. I always did research, I always found nothing. This one is very different. This one there are too many coincidences. It MUST be fully investigated. And that may mean a few other theories are applied to see if they fit. If Pizzagate is real, they can pull off nearly anything.</p></p>

<p><p>ITT A bunch of people who were described in one of OPs categories and are now assblasted because of it. </p>
<p>He's right, you know? Shitposting completely unrelated nonsense isn't contributing to whatever it is your desired eventuality is. </p>
<p>I am someone who has already run the spectrum of skeptic, to cautiously open to the idea, to a believer to now back to skeptic based exclusively on the amount of FUD and bullshit "RED ALERTS" and "HOLY SHIT GUYS" posts thst are nothing but a pizza place in Topeka with a pizza slice as their logo. </p>
<p>OPs post was spot on as I've seen no shortage of each and every type of person he mentioned in it here. </p></p>

<p><p>I somewhat agree. I think we should ban every religious person. The moment someone says shit like "Pray for the children" or pulls out buzzwords like illuminati, satanism, occult, mk-ultra, michelle is a tranny... I'm sorry but they've just openly stated they're just as nuts as Alex Jones.</p>
<p>The facts are enough without religious nuts speculating.</p>
<p>jimmycomet's instagram feed is enough to raise both eyebrows and so are podesta's leaks.</p></p>

<p>Yeah, if I can be blunt here: fuck off. Consolidation, leaders, goals - all set up structures and single points of failure to attack. Gamergate didn't do this and neither will we. Instead we will be a swarm of bees, stinging any exposed flesh and retiring at night to make the honey for everyone else. We don't care what you think.  </p></p>

<p><p>I am saving this post. Please respond after the truth comes out. My friend we are living in the matrix. We have been since Kennedy was assassinated. It's like the movie They Live. Suddenly you see things for what they really are. Please google Ideological Subversion. It is a tool used by countries wanting to convert it to communism. </p>
<p>Look I'm an atheist, I still am. I was liberal. I'm 38 years old, I have three kids and live in Iowa. I have a wonderful husband and family.  I voted for Obama in 2008. I am not what I used to think was a crazy Christian. I have been brainwashed by whole life. Everyone has. Ideological Subversion is a slow process, that is why this is so shocking and unbelievable. 
Last night I was living three realities. This manufactured one and, this real, evil, corrupted world, and the world of my children, husband and family. I know where I belong now so I'm at peace. </p>
<p>Since the beginning of the campaigning I just did not like what Hillary said, she was so fake. Just a politician. But the news just praised her like she was a saint. Now I remember a years back, Bill being linked to Epstein. So I got on YouTube and watched some of my news channels. I haven't watched news much since the Sandy Hook shooting. (Which I am sure will be revealed as a government plot) the more I watched on Hillary I knew something was up. Seizures, fake rallies, collapsing. And she is still married to Bill, and we all know about his scandal in the White House. People tend to forget he was impeached. So I was sort of on to her. I watched a video on some of the leaked pedestal emails. To I got on wiki leaks and went thru the emails. This was in early November. And holy shit, some of the wording was not right. Made no sense. So I looked up Podesta emails on YouTube, and some people had found the link with the pedophile logos. Immediately I researched more and more listened to tons of videos and scanned Facebook. But there was nothing on Facebook about this. How could that be? Days went by. Pizzagate was unfolding before my eyes. Posts were disappearing photos vanishing. I posted and posted about this Pedo ring they have running! Pizzagate is the tip of the iceberg at this point. Everything you thought you knew since Kennedys Assasination is an illusion. Think about how much everyone is distracted with the violence occurring that our government caused. A diversion. This is why violence has erupted around this election. </p>
<p>For someone that has been brainwashed and just coming upon this it's shocking. But for those of us working on this and shouting it out from the beginning, the leaked emails, we have been deprogrammed and see the real world. </p>
<p>I read this and it sounds so insane. But it is real. Donald Trump will have given Thanksgiving another meaning for me. Donald Trump has saved us from a communist take over from China. All of the details are too much to take. But please objectively think about all that has been happening around us. And just know that when the change to REAL freedom happens we will be there to help you. I can't imagine learning all of this suddenly.
I avoided being committed by my family. Think of Kanye West. His whole reality came crashing down when he realized Beyoncé and jay z are part of this. </p>
<p>I wish you could trust me when I say this is real. And we have been saved. </p>
<p>Please take a look at this video, it was recorded in the 80's. It explains exactly what is happening. Please watch entire video. It is a soviet defector. This is what opened my eyes. After you realize what is going on then watch the Presidential Dinner. </p>
<p>Please watch. </p>

<p><p>This lady is right.  Right about the brainwashing.  Right about the ongoing subversion.  Right about the government plots.  </p>
<p>I always thought that the Bolsheviks didn't just 'go away' when the Soviet Union collapsed.  They have been up to no good all this time, and their plans are (or were) working perfectly.  I didn't even consider the Chinese angle.  But I am pretty sure that the next 'red terror' will feature conservatives and christians as the victims du jour. </p></p>

<p><p>The fact this post is up there telling me my eyes didn't see what they saw then telling me to post proof or GTFO? Tells me everything I need to know about your motive and control.</p>
<p>Fuck off. I'm well aware of larpers and I think overall we do a pretty good job sussing out the fake shit. It's a process not a button. And I'm going to continue to report trolls asking me to prove I saw an 6-8 year old olive skin boy with dark eyes and dark curly hair using a dick shoved in his mouth while he giggled and wiped the cum off his face with his shirt. This kid has been abused so long he thinks it's normal. And if gay Thai and philipino dudes don't want the world to see their gay porn maybe it should not be in public accounts so STFU about that it's not working. Having lived in Asian countries I am well aware of what young asians look like. </p>
<p>This isn't even a concern troll this is their top gun. Well sir TOP GUN FAIL. I'm fully aware of being targeted yesterday and mods can verify how much I had to report... get rid of the ones who know... and I know my post the other day in which I made it clear how things are linked and how the foolish is mixed with fact to discredit fact. How I noted that mind control involving pain/pleasure is historical and false things are input so that if the victim ever talks they will be dismissed. I guess your next move is to sic the dogs on me yes? Because if this doesn't work the next thing will be targeting people who are "dangerous" posters who seem to "know".
(If anyone wants to read that post where I explain this you can either scroll half a few pages lol sorry probably more than a few) in my posts or find the thread on here about the mind control victim from OZ. I spent too much time with masters of manipulation and have actually "worked with and learned from" one of the absolute masters in the entire world of NLP.
As anyone will see reading my posts I got invaded yesterday and I'm patient until I'm not anymore. So listen up you fucking Israel and CTR and "oh hey new group"... fuck off. That shit doesn't work on me and you're wasting your words. There's a reason I was taught how to recognize your shit.</p>
<p>And before any Israel tarde dv me google israels online fucking army. </p>
<p>Fuck off op. The master concern troll written to manipulate. Jedi mind tricks don't work on me. And I know Jedi kind tricks when I read them. </p></p>
