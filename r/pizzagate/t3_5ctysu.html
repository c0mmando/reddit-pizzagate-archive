        <strong>The term "MAP"</strong>
        <p><p>This is may be something or nothing; but I figured it'd be better to share this info I have.</p>
<p>Seeing the term "MAP" used as a pedo-code word for me triggered a memory. There is a small pedophile acceptance community on tumblr; one of the terms they use to describe themselves is "MAP". In their community MAP means Minor Attracted Person. I always thought it was kind of creepy before; only other pedos will know what "map" really means and us normal folk will think nothing of it.</p></p>

        <p><p>You're right. Minor Attracted Person(MAP) is a real thing. It's the "politically correct" way of coming to terms with being a pedofile. </p></p>

        <p><p>i think hankerchief is simply a form of trophy.
map being stain of whatever they wanted on it, and cheese related is just affirming whoever's hankerchief it was that it is pedo related</p>
<p>in every pedo case theres been some sort of trophy.</p></p>

        <p><p>The prior consensus was "Map" meant semen/sexual fluid.</p>
<p>'The handkerchief has "semen" which seems pizza-related.'</p>
<p>If you believe what you are saying then handkerchief must mean something completely different.What do you suggest handkerchief means?</p></p>

        <p><p>I think she scouts for him, I think the handkerchief is a person (minor attracted person)/MAP that likes pizza...and the person is black/white they like dominant/"dominos"bdsm shit...on virgins(white) black/white hanky...he says don't worry about it, like "nah not interested in hooking your client up" he's the pimp. Maybe she vets the clients to keep a buffer from him due to his status..just thinking that's all</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't know. It could just be a homonym. Do I agree in the context of that sentence semen makes much more sense. </p>
<p>I just remembered it and thought I should share. The pedophile community on tumblr may not at all be connected to the pedo cult we're looking at. But I saw on here saw that other pedo communities (like 8chan) used "cheese pizza" and figured there's chance they may be sharing the same lingo. </p>
<p>I found out about this a Kiwi Farms, there is a board on it if you're curious, maybe you'll connect something I haven't pieced together yet. </p>

I just came from checking the Field house and I have a square cloth handkerchief (white w/ black) that was left on the kitchen island.
Happy to send it via the mail if you let me know where I should send it.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want. I know you're busy, so feel free not to respond if it's not yours or you don't want it.</p>

        <p><p>It's not a code word, it's a euphemism.  A lot of pedophiles are really afraid of calling themselves pedophiles so they came up with a nicer sounding word for it.  It's not a criminal thing, it's more of a whiny liberal thing.</p></p>

        <p><p>Wrong. All child molesters are OF COURSE paedophiles, but many paedophiles are able to keep their urges under control. If you are one such person then I have the utmost respect for you, but if you touch a child inappropriately that respect turns to disgust. </p></p>

        <p><p>Huge myth. A rapist doesn't have to be attracted to the victim to rape. Rape is about power and children are extra vulnerable to being abused. Peole rape vulnerable groups like the elderly or mental/physically disabled. </p></p>
