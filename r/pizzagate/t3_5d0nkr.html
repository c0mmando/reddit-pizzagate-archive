        <strong>I have reason to believe the "farm"owner is David Barmak (attorney in DC)</strong>
        <p><p>OWNED BY DAVD LEITER &amp; TAMARA LUZZATO. Barmak's connection is unknown but he HAS been emailed by Luzzato to come to the farm</p>
<p>~~David Barmak is an attorney in DC. He seems to be implicated everytime they mention the mysterious "farm" that keeps coming up. He works for mintz-levin,~~

<p>"RE: Next Sunday at Tamera and David's farm"</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39175</p>
<p>&nbsp; 
~~he is admitted to the bar in Virginia, and has various (4) distinctions regarding Virginia in law jargon I do not understand. He works in DC / NY as well.~~</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have reason to believe beyond a reasonable doubt that his email is 
&nbsp;</p>
<p>[removed for anti-doxxing rule, his email is present on the website and also in the email linked below]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply because that is the mailto: link on the mintz-levin website.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The farm is located in lovettsville, Virginia. </p>

am popping up again to share our excitement about the Reprise

<p>Email directly implicating David as he is emailed by Tamera Luzzato:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>edit:  the property is owned by Tamara Luzzato and David Leiter</p>
<p>more weird farm stuff and Tamara Luzzato

<blockquote>
<p>Tomatoes galore, beans, yellow squash, okra, and more. He will drop me off at Dulles today at 2:30--I'm flying to &gt;hook up with my father for a service for one of the 3 remaining of his 9 siblings until we lost one last Tuesday, &gt;and he was a fave uncle, to Minn--so the farmer can do drop offs on way into DC
Best to all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there are more emails regarding the farm but there is so much digging to do for that. One email references the kids ages (all under 13) coming to the farm to play in the pool, which admittedly is innocent sounding enough but with all the other weird references I thought I'd point this out.</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bonnie will be using  Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so &gt;you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be that pool for sure.</p>

<p>edit II: the  "farm" is 12299 Enfield Lane. </p>

        <p><p>I don't know the address.
Edit: I found the address in one of the emails. There's no google street view for it but I grabbed a satellite view. It's a huge property with a huge yard. I'm not American, but is farm synonymous to cottage/summer home? Because while that property is on a HUGE plot, it doesn't look like anything is growing there. Although, the map could have been friom prior to 2014. There's also no pool.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's not uncommon to call a property a farm even if it doesn't grow actual crops.  Generally, just being a large property with enough room to grow a crop qualifies it for the label.</p>
<p>I decided to look into the pool aspect of this, and this link:
https://www.redfin.com/VA/Lovettsville/12299-Enfield-Ln-20180/home/12014815</p>
<p>Has this: 
Exterior Features:
Pool: gunite</p>
<p>Googling that, showed me this: 
http://imgur.com/a/A3nK9</p>
<p>and if you look at the map of the property, it's possible the pool is here: http://imgur.com/a/IgMbA</p></p>
