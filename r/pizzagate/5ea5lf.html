    Can we have a weekly stickied post with that week's findings and evidence updates?
   </strong>

    I think this is necessary for us to be able to gather and disseminate real information, and get it out there.
   </p>
   <p>
    A post yesterday on /r/conspiracy highlighted the similarities to our world at the moment and Aldous Huxley's 'Brave New World'.... we don't want our discoveries and investigations to get lost in a sea of information as per usual.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are posts I have seen with guns (metaphorical), maybe not smoking, but still guns... that have completely disappeared into the sea of knowledge that is this sub, and I haven't seen again. This CANNOT happen.
   </p>
   <p>
    Can I also just add, please keep up the amazing work, and the growth of this sub is amazing - it shows us that more are awakening day by day.

     I know. As much as it would be amazing if this weren't all true (for the children), I'm craving that hard, tasty evidence now. This has been a long time coming.
