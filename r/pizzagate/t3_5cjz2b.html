        <p><p>Exactly only a spotlight on this will do anything. Controlled media, justice and law enforcement agencies will protect the elites. In a just world John and his brother would have already been taken in. Computers and property seized.</p></p>

        <p><p>Do we have reliable numbers on the #of child-sex traffickers arrested each year from Operation Cross Country X?  I initially believe the large  number (239) that the FBI claimed they arrested was because they were acting on the pedophile ring exposed by the 650,000 emails recovered from Weiner by the NYPD.  After learning of DOJ ties to pizzagate, I am starting to wonder if Operation Cross Country X is a psy-op to make it look like they are doing something.  It sounds like they may just be doing stings to catch 16-17-year olds engaging in prostitution, then adding those to the numbers for "child-sex trafficking".  It is very dishonest of them to be doing this and I think they are doing it to tell a narrative.</p>

        <p><p>Yeah. a good rule of thumb anything "child" related created by Clintons, Podestas, David Brock, and hell even creepy Biden (we'll hold off on our "hope" president for now since that's depressing to think about), consider those programs to be questionable establishments until proven otherwise.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's worth noting that Operation Cross Country is more than a decade old. Their efforts on this topic are going International next year.</p></p>
