   <strong>
    Jimmy Savile wearing a giant pedo necklace pendant
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Sorry, not directly pizzagate related - but it did give me more confirmation about the Besta Pizza logo being suspect
   </p>
   <p>
    I got sidetracked from the main pizzagate event and started watching "When Louis met Jimmy" (a documentary about Jimmy Savile - a pedophile of known quantity - https://vimeo.com/76002148).  Just about lost my shit at the 15:47 mark when I saw the necklace he was wearing - http://imgur.com/a/SF8me
   </p>
   <p>
    He insisted that it was a wishbone.  Riiiight.
   </p>
   <p>
    Can't believe the guy, 500 allegations and not a speck of remorse, wears a giant pedo necklace to boast about it. Unbelievable.

    Jimmy was an exemplary when it came to pedo. He literally flaunt it, coerced the young girls and the parents and complained to the higher ups when he smelt suspected they were onto him. In Loius Theroux documentary, all of his narcissistic, egomania and controlling nature is on full display. He was not only into pedophilia but went beyond that. He was a necrophiliac and devoid of any human character. David Icke would call him a lizard, we would call him a psychopath.
   </p>
   <p>
    In his little hometown, everyone knew..it was an open secret as they say. They knew he was a ponce. He was an octupus with tentacles reaching all the right people to get him out of a sticky situation.
   </p>
   <p>
    What is far more disturbing is those that covered for him. They are all those in the BBC, the British govt and his fellow pedos. I hope his soul never escapes the darkness that lied within his dark heart.

       Someone made the same connection in 2012:

      <blockquote>

       There are even links to Kim Noble's "art" (e.g., "What Ted Saw"), with the handkerchiefs and child abuse.

    The Saville thing really is kind of scary. When someone is hiding in plain sight to the point where they have a fantastic journalist making a peice on them and the topic of paedophillia comes up and even then after his admitidally rather sketchy answer no one suspects him. Makes you think what else goes on unnoticed. Scary shit.

     Yes, the audacity of it all.  I just don't get.  This Vice article covers pedophilia in another community - http://www.vice.com/read/the-child-rape-assembly-line-0000141-v20n11 - similar lack of remorse

      What I find so saddening is that Comey has likely known about all this for years, and yet has done nothing. Even as they rescue kids and capture some small timers, they know the ringleaders are an arms length away. That would destroy me inside. All that training, knowledge, and duty, and they don't make the move to end these crimes.

     You've not seen this one? It's one of his most well known docs. He recently did another called just "Savile" which deals with his own friendship with Jimmy.

      I was surprised too, i was pretty sure i've seen each single one already. Guess somehow i managed this pass this. Seems to be one of his first ones, judging by his looks.

    i think they have to pay homage, to their deity or God or beliefs, in all that they do. 
Hence the constant references and blatantly obvious symbols.

     It's a stylized wishbone given to him as a gift. Not much info on Google, some tentative speculation. He did, however, wear a pendant made with a glass eye he stole from a corpse (from my first cursory search plugging in 'pendant' and 'jimmy savile').
