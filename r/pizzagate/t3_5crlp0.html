<p><p>The last three days we have been slow moving here compared to last week. Idk if it's shills or just bad organization but lately you're all posting old discoveries as brand new finds and we are just burning resources on already solved issues. </p>
<p>Please refer to the existing archives before posting, an extra set of eyes is ok but don't spin us in circles. </p></p>
