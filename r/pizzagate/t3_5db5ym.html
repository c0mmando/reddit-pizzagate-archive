        <strong>The tinfoil is getting out of hand.</strong>
        <p><p>Listen guys,</p>
<p>We all have raging justice boners. Pedos are the scum of the earth. We have some very suspicious emails that point to a high-ranking Democratic operative connected with the Clintons and Obama being involved in a pedophile ring, and a tenuous connection to a popular hipster hangout with some questionable associations and a shady password-protected area containing some videos with weird filenames. Then there's Buck's, Besta Pizza, Politics and Prose, Terasol, and Beyond Borders, which all have legit pedo logos and/or connections to the Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p>That's about all we have in terms of solid leads. And we ought to be looking into them.</p>
<p>What we should NOT be doing is doxxing, harassing people on social media, posting about random pizza places in Bumfuck, Alabama with spirals on their website, posting flyers around CPP, or focusing on occult/Satanic connections. This will accomplish NOTHING except to waste time and make us easy to discredit. </p>
<p>Please, I implore you. Focus on solid investigative work and on building a narrative that the public will be able to "follow and swallow" as I like to put it.</p>
<p>/u/pizzathrowaway777, you and the other mods need to be VERY careful about not giving the admins even the thinnest excuse to shut this sub down. That means being absolutely anal-retentive about site rules. You <em>also</em> need to be hyper-vigilant about avoiding even the <em>appearance</em> that you condone breaking the law in any way.</p>
<p>Remember, the media and law enforcement <strong>are not on our side</strong>. If we are to win in the court of public opinion, our behavior must be absolutely impeccable. If any of us break the law, it will not only go badly for them but paint the entirety of PizzaGate with a broad black brush.</p>
<p>Focus on the Podestas and the Clinton Foundation. Build a chain of unassailable evidence. Stay on the high road. Avoid distractions and disinfo. Otherwise the kiddy diddlers win.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's true, but it's been systematically covered up for so long that in order to convince the general public to act, we need to present the information in a way that is palatable to them, in a way that is not speculation and circumstantial evidence but CANNOT BE IGNORED. </p>
<p>Those in control has been throwing out so much distraction and disinformation, and everyone has eaten it up. They have to, because you're asking them to accept something that destabilizes their entire reality. </p>
<p>We've got to be careful how we do this, so we can make the greatest possible impact instead of being dismissed and repressed yet again.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Not a troll, I'm not the one who took the picture with a potato so honestly idk, the picture's been scrubbed from most internet pages indicating they don't want us to see it. Anyways analyzing the details is what got us into this mess in the first place. Tavistock has crafted our entire reality to create a devil's playground, our linear thinking is pretty useless in trying to understand the enormity of this thing. Anyways tired of spewing "crazy" stuff, no stopping this train https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23pizzagate&amp;src=typd, time to buckle up, gonna be a rude awakening for a lot of people. </p></p>

<p>who/what is Tavistock? and nothing about this photo is real. He's got his hand down a little girl's pants, holding what appears to be a grocery bag, coming off a trolley (or what it looks like) and apparently a "demon" in the background. Also, the photo appears to be taken from like a foot away. Just....no dude </p></p>

        <p><p>We have to also remember the things that fbianon said. The Clinton Foundation is the major player in this. That it is not just human trafficking, but weapons and drugs as well. I would not be surprised if we discover that some of these cryptic emails have things to do with drugs and weapons, and money laundering as well as the pedo shit. </p>
<p>Let us not get tunnel vision, lest we mistakenly connect the wrong dots and head down wrong direction. Doing something like that would be exactly what they would hope we do. Remain skeptical and vigilant at all times while we explore the emails, and evidence that we have.</p>
<p>We need to get these bastards for every crooked thing they are doing.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm really really tired of people reporting every damn critical post or disagreement post as being a "CTR shill". Address the content and criticisms in the open or just walk away.</p>
<p>This isn't a safe space. If you want to persuade people you're going to have to do the legwork that is involved. I'm not willing to protect any of your from disagreement.</p>
<p>We will continue to remove troll posts, irrelevant posts, threatening posts, obvious misdirection, and things that otherwise violate sitewide rules.</p>
<p>Any thing else is up to the rest of you to counter. Upvote, downvote, or respond.</p></p>

        <p><p>There are plenty of obvious troll posts in here that haven't been touched... I mean</p>
