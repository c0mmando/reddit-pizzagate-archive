    My worry is that this is just the tip of the iceberg, and the more we pull the threads, the sweater will keep unraveling to include high-powered officials who wouldn't prosecute these individuals, even when presented with concrete, irrefutable evidence.
   </p>
   <p>
    Historically speaking, is there a similar situation that's ever happened anywhere in the world, where the corrupt high-ranking officials are involved in a massive cover-up, and use their power to sweep everything under the rug, but still somehow justice finds a way?
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm starting to think that a Spotlight-esque solution of mass publishing the evidence would be the best in such a case, but I don't know if there exist any other more efficient examples or avenues.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thoughts?

    Assuming, of course, that the accused can stay alive long enough and not be sacrificed to Molech when they hear the rumblings in the distance.

    Once a sufficient amount of evidence is acquired the best we can hope for is an autodidactic red-pilling of the public leading to outrage at the very least.
The trouble with pedo story's is that historically they've been ignored due to (at the VERY least) three-monkey media and mums: it's just too terrible for most people to consider.
The difference this time is that the Internet has FULLY saturated the narrative of grassroots.
   </p>
   <p>
    The elite have ALWAYS engaged in this behavior, since time immemorial; the difference now is we are no longer hapless amnesiacs.

    Also South Korea's President was revealed to be a puppet under a unnamed cult leader a few weeks ago. Millions of people protested the cities of Korea and the cult leader was arrested, and president was removed.

    Pedophilia is just one part of our government that is being hidden from us.  I believe once pizzagate blows this wide open more citizens will demand answers regarding energy, travel, and foreign relations.  The government is organized crime and I hope more people are begining to be more open minded about what is happening.  We just have to keep waking people up, eventually we will win.
