        <strong>Pizza place using known symbols and proven links to pedo activity</strong>
        <p><p>Ferinos.Com </p>
<p>Just look at the symbols! They're using slight variations on not only 1, but 2 FBI recognized pedo symbols.  </p>
<p>Still not convinced? Google "4chan ferinos pizza" this is the very same pizza place that was involved in a scandal a few months back when it was revealed they had hidden cameras in their bathrooms and we're releasing videos of minors using the restroom to 4chan.  I would be interested in knowing if any of our key players have a connection to this place.</p></p>

        <p><p>I assume wavy lines are now missformed spirals. Any every type of pizza piece is a triangle which is now obviously the kind of triangle spiral the FBI mentioned.</p>
<p>So full of this shit really :/</p></p>
