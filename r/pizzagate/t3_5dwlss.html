        <strong>Shock Video: *PURPLE* Guy of Freddy FazBear's Pizzeria (the Five Night's At Freddy's (FNAF) kids' game) depicted as a gleeful kidnapper and child molester.</strong>
        <p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCTeKIeAJk0">FNAF Purple Guy Revealed!</a></p>
<p>Notice his context when referencing pizza in the dialogue?</p>
<p>What correlations exist between the color purple (Purple Guy) and #Pizzagate ?</p></p>

        <p><p>Def fake, it's part of a video game or something.  The context is disgusting, strangely there are a lot of connections to pizza and abducting children.  This relates to the wiki emails... scary disturbing stuff... Kinda supports the whole pedo code words</p></p>

        <p><p>None of that matters. This is using the exact code for the exact same reason. Dude is going to a pizza party with tied up kids. It could not be more connected.</p></p>

        <p><p>Ok so you know about a video game. The "fan" who made the video clearly used the word in the same context regardless of anything else. </p></p>

        <p><p>So i guess this little part in the video is an accident? https://sli.mg/NkZcRQ</p></p>

        <p><p>I understand that it's a fan video for a kid's game and don't want to ignite a witch-hunt (if unwarranted) against the creator, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_fkFE_MJes">Scott Cawthon</a>. I also don't want to divert the precious time of our investigators in this sub.</p>
<p>However, I've found alarming correlations:</p>
<p>1) Pizza/Pizzerias and Child Abduction/Molestation.</p>
<p>2) When Purple Guy says 'pizza' during the video, the context seems to mirror the pedophile code.</p>
<p>3) The Podesta/Clinton emails from Wikileaks reveal pedophile code when discussing pizza/birthday parties.</p>
<p>4) The symbolism of the color purple, <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-11/clintons-and-soros-launch-americas-purple-revolution">Soros's Purple Revolution</a>, and its ties to pedophilia.</p>
<p>5) The pedophilia references in Purple Guy's dialogue:</p>
<p>"Their bellies were bloated with pizza! And I said, I've gotta have a <em>bite</em> of that." (lures children into his car with pizza)
"I'll show you EXACTLY what <strong>pizza</strong> can <em>taste</em> like!" (maniacal laugh)</p>
<p>"And they keep <strong>coming</strong>, there's no <em>end</em> to the little kids <strong>coming</strong> out of the pizzeria. Endless <strong>streams</strong> of kids, bloated bellies and oh! (licks fingers and screams in exhilaration) I love it!"</p>
<p>"It's my <strong>birthday</strong> today and I wanna have <strong>fun</strong>!"
(video-records his victims: two bound and gagged boys who appear terrified) "It's my <strong>birthday</strong> today, so I wanna have a <strong>pizza party</strong>. You wanna join me?"</p>
<p>6) The FNAF theme centers around taking something people associate with innocent childhood fun, like Chuck E. Cheese, arcade pizzerias, and costumed animals, and perverting it. The occult follows this trend. See the <a href="https://twitter.com/Goy_Orbison/status/797604429700722688">stuffed animals</a> pictured in Tony Podesta's bedroom next to the box of tissues (check out the comments).</p>
<p>Realize that, over one year ago, someone already knew these obscure pedophile codes well enough to place them in the above Purple Guy video, which also just happens to promote a kid's game about a sinister pizzeria.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's promotional material for a live action Five Nights at Freddy's movie. Disturbing in the context of this sub for sure though. </p></p>

        <p><p>It's a fan-made film to promote a mobile children's game (the FNAF series) where animatronic characters jump-scare players in an after-hours pizzeria.</p>
<p>It's like a Chuck-E-Cheese from Hell. I didn't notice anything outwardly nefarious when I first watched it. But, reading about #Pizzagate reminded me of the disturbing Purple Guy video and I wondered about a connection.</p>
<p>I watched again to analyze the dialogue and <strong>it seems he's using 'pizza' as pedophile code.</strong></p></p>
