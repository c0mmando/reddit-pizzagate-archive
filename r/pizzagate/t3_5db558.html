<strong>With regards to personal information of non-public figures; it has been made clear to us by the reddit.com site admins that posting personal information related to non-public figures is against the site-wide TOS. Going forward, this will be prohibited in order to prevent a potential subreddit ban.</strong>
<p><p>Hello all,</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/UZCc4dy.png">We have been contacted by the reddit admins today</a> with regards to multiple threads which were engaged in the posting of personal information related to non-public figures. Going forward, these type of posts will be prohibited pursuant to the current standing doctrine promulgated to us today by the admins. It should be noted that the admins were careful to emphasize that this dictum pertains specifically and only to non-public figures.</p>
<p>The mod team of this subreddit very much values the free flow of information, however we must abide by the policies of reddit in order to facilitate the continued existence of this subreddit.</p>
<p>To that end, please be very careful with regards to what information is posted in relation to non-public persons (private citizens); if you engage in this behavior, you may very well threaten the existence of the sub; and to those trolls who see this as an opening to do just that, be aware that we will be steadfast in our commitment to weed out and remove any personal information that is posted in relation to non-public figures.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the distinction between private and public persons can be quite nuanced, as various US courts have ruled that there exists sub categories of the designation such as "involuntary public figure" and "limited purpose public figure". That said, it is left only to the admins of this website to determine the application of those designations, and we must abide by their judgements in order to protect the existence of this subreddit.</p>
<p>That said, the standard used most often by the admins in making their determination as to the status of a given individual as a public/private person is usually media reports. Again, this too can be a subjective standard as "media" in our contemporary age ranges from blogs to the NYT. However, that principle (media coverage) does give some guidance to the moderators as to how to apply the reddit TOS in this subreddit going forward; as such, we will use media coverage as a benchmark to determine the extent of acceptable information that may be posted in relation to a given individual and we ask that you accept this necessary restraint in order to allow the continued work of this subreddit.</p>
<p>While this entails a far more arduous workload on the part of the mod team, facilitating the continued existence of this subreddit (and therefore, this investigation) is of paramount concern; and we are more than willing to do whatever is necessary to allow that to happen.</p>
<p>Out sincerest apologies for the oversight which allowed the problematic posts to slip through the cracks and raise the ire of the admins; however as a young subreddit, we still have much to learn and we are appreciative of the admins for their willingness to give us a warning, and opportunity to correct the behavior in lieu of an outright ban.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>;</p>
<p>It really comes down to making sure that private individuals aren't being harassed as a result of postings in this subreddit from the perspective of the site's owners. To that end, I think it's important to recognize that reddit isn't meant to be a place for investigations of non-public persons as they can easily lead to dangerous witchhunting/libel. The proper thing to do, from the perspective of the admins, is to contact law enforcement with any tips that are uncovered to ensure they are looked at by authorities instead of random people on the internet.</p>
<p>Please feel free to ask any questions below, and thank you kindly for your understanding.</p></p>

<p><p>If you read the message, the admins give a hat tip to the importance of the work being done in this subreddit; to that end, I think they know full well the extent of the depravity involved in this situation, but are nonetheless constrained by their legal obligations. </p>
<p>That's my guess at least.</p></p>

<p><p>There really needs to be a united 'backup base' for the investigation off reddit in the event this sub is banned, which I can foresee in the future as things get closer to the bone. I think it's up to the mods here and those well involved in other subreddits like r/the_donald and r/conspiracy to unite, to discuss the avenues - there is a great number of you with the skills to make it happen - to create that base (which I envision is a model where users can post) and publicize its existence.</p></p>

<p><p>No. We feel there is substantial proof and it highly merits an investigation.</p>
<p>We just want an investigation. The more entities whom quickly dismiss the matter are questionable as to their motives and agendas.</p></p>

<p><p>I feel we are not talking about the same posts. It got way better (mostly due to mods removing them) but there were several posts like:</p>
<p>"Have you seen this dude who commented on the Pizza instagram once? He has a child in one of his pictures!!!"</p>
<p>followed by comments like:</p>
<p>"What a pedophile scum", "Watch out satanist, we will get you".</p>
<p>I dont see the issue with many of them ether, especially no issue if the person already is a public person. But this sub is going to far at some points.</p></p>

<p><p>I am just questioning how your answer to BadAgent fits here if that is not the thing you tried to say. He is making a point about false accusions of persons not of public interest. Your comment sounds like it is ok to accuse anyone of pedophilia, as long as this makes sure all children are safe.</p></p>

<p><p>On a hypothetical website that allowed public investigators... yeah I think that the ends <em>might</em> justify the means of doxxing. If the FBI isn't doing their job (or if they've been stonewalled by moles/DoJ) then why not let the public do some digging?</p></p>

<p><p>I am glad the mods removed most of these posts, but do you know what happens when a person of no interest is googled and their name was mentioned on reddit once? Exactly, the first result on google will be reddit. Therefore the person will be fucked for a long time. You have to agree that some (surely not all!) conclusions posted here are basically based on thin air.</p>
<p>Btw, reddit does not allow that. I dont know how this sub was not banned so far actually.</p></p>

<p><p>Associate with kid Diddlers, and I think you bear some guilt.  You don't take that lightly and there's no moral relativism to it.  Let it be known that Podesta is a diddler, and if you knowingly enable that, are you any good as a human?</p></p>

<p><p>i think that is even more reason to enforce no PII.  We don't have all the pieces yet and if someone is found out to be innocent, they are now linked with pedo all over the web</p>

<p><p>Innocent until proven guilty is a vital foundation of modern law, we can't throw it away because we have some theories brewing. Once we can prove <em>beyond a reasonable doubt</em> that some individual has committed crime, we are obligated to obey the law and respect the privacy of citizens.</p>
<p>Accusations =/= guilt.</p></p>

<p><p>There is no law in America preventing the discussion of publicly available information or reddit's absurd definition of a "private/non-public" person. There is no such thing as a "private/non-public" citizen. </p>

<p>Let's all hit the chan threads from here on out, when the time comes for these degenerate scum to be taken down, let's remind the whole world that /u/spez was bribed by David Brock's Correct the Record, and is criminally liable for helping cover for these sick fucks.</p></p>

<p><p>Let me say that I've been watching pizza-gate since the beginning and believe where there's this much smoke there's gotta be fire. But, TBH, these are serious allegations being made. The evidence being rock solid or ethereal doesn't matter. Reddit and its users are not judge, jury and executioner. </p>
<p>This is not a case of Reddit censoring its users because they're bad people, this is Reddit doing what it needs to do to avoid being sued for slander. </p>
<p>Frankly, I'm surprised such detailed and preliminary research is being done so out in the open. Tactically it's self-defeating, i.e. if you're on the trail of someone or something it seems to me that it's being telegraphed here out in the open.....</p></p>

<p><p>You are talking about public persons. I rather think about the countless other people that are now linked to beeing a pedophile because they ate pizza at the wrong place and wrote a comment about it or have created art that involves children.

<p><p>I understand that some of the people being vilified are innocent, but frankly, I have conducted all of my research in private, and never reached out to anyone, or posted those shit-for-brain comments on Jimmy Comet's Instagram. Those idiots did more damage to the investigation by tipping off these guilty fucks than most people realize. They are most likely filling in the underground tunnels as we speak because of those idiots.</p>
<p>I've said repeatedly, the officials inside the law enforcement community probably have all the necessary evidence required to bring these people down, they are just waiting for Obama to get out of office, so that he can't mass pardon the guilty, or possibly start a war. These leaks are basically just confirming the public's suspicions into the guilt of the Clintons and the shadow government that they empowered. </p>
<p>They <em>want</em> us to cheerlead, so that when the time comes, the public will be on board and ready for the shitstorm that will follow.</p></p>

<p><p>Is linking their initials okay? I mean how is anything going to continue without being able to discuss possible leads or connections?

<p><p>I don't understand. So is it that we can discuss "non-public" individuals as long as we don't post any direct urls or info related to their personal info (with exception of "media articles") or is it that we just can't discuss "private persons" at all, period? </p></p>

<p>I ... don't know how to answer that based on what we were told today. I have asked an admin to comment in this thread in order to clarify their perspective; hopefully they will use that opportunity to address your question regarding the current ambiguity. </p></p>

<p><p>I really wish we didn't have to because I'm ideologically all for the free transmission of publicly accessible information. But at the end of the day we are constricted by Reddit rules. </p>
<p>There are always forums like the chan imageboards where people can go to share and discuss this stuff. Reddit should be considered a platform for outreach and information dissemination.</p></p>

<p><p>Again; that type of workaround that adheres to the letter, but not the spirit, of the admin's dictum will still be used to ban the subreddit based on previous experience; it will also make the admins hate us, rather than sympathize with the work being done.</p></p>

<p><p>Since Alefantis is listed in the Podesta emails,has been featured on TV and has been   named as one of the 50 most influential people in DC I assume you are free to discuss and expose him (as well as the Podesta bros)?</p></p>

<p><p>Yes. He has also had relevant media relations with Washington City Paper since this investigation started. That can be taken as him declaring himself a public figure.</p>
<p>That said, the James we're investigating is not the same James as is presented publicly. They may share the same body, but that's as far as it goes.</p></p>

<p><p>This is very important.  I have withheld posting the names of a few women and the names of their children of whom I've discovered emails that look like these kids are or were at risk of exploitation or more. . I</p>
<p>In one case, I decided not to post an email with a picture of a baby holding a sign with a message for John Podesta. I found it very troubling but didn't want to draw attention to that child or the mom in case it somehow was innocent.  </p>
<p>Instead I alerted the proper authorities. </p></p>

<p><p>They did not confirm or deny anything that we are investigating. But they did say that pedophilia and child abuse is far more common than most people would imagine.  And that in some cases politicians and law-enforcement personnel are involved.  </p>
<p>And lastly that the idea of a mother actually offering her young child for sexual abuse is not unheard of. That sometimes if they had been abused themselves this is one way of normalizing their experience in a way of dealing with it.</p>
<p>In other words I refuse to accept the dismissal by some people that this is just conspiratorial fantasy. </p></p>

<p>Posting a publicly available link to the home address of a public figure (such as a senator) is not allowed.</p>
<p>Posting a publicly available link to the contact information for a congressional office is allowed.</p></p>

<p><p>Hello, r/pizzagate.</p>
<p>To reiterate in a different way, and to impart a strategy that I have felt was important all along, it is best if everyone reports to the authorities, what they feel they can verify, personally.</p>
<p>Top priority. Children. You can make a report as a discretionary reporter and send it by snail mail to the appropriate authorities. </p>
<p>What we can substantiate, here, are mostly financial crimes.</p>
<p>If you guys really want to make a difference, report anything you see that gives you probable cause to believe an investigation needs to occur.</p>
<p>Step 1: Identify the jurisdiction for which the crime occurred.</p>
<p>Step 2: Identify the crime that is occurring.</p>
<p>Example: James Alefantis posts pictures of large amounts of cash in foreign denominations that was never declared. Bam. That money is seizable. Send a letter to the IRS stating that Mr. Alefentis is engaging in illegal activity, to which he advertises the proceeds on social media and does not report them on taxes. This foreign currency was not reported when it was brought into the country.</p>
<p>Send to IRS and to ICE.</p>
<p>If a thousand of you do that, it generates an investigation and a paper trail.</p>
<p>Sidenote: </p>
<p>http://voat.co/v/pizzagate</p>
<p>http://voat.co/v/webofslime</p>
<p>Are maybe a little more lax in regards to some things that reddit might censor you for.</p></p>

<p>https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3217560/Dokument-om-pædofile-hjemmesider-fra-FBI.p</p>
<p>This was dropped on wikileaks twitter. It is from 2013. Note Maryland. It is 100 pages. It is worth reading in-full.</p>
<p>I think this is useful for folks having difficulty getting their head around this issue. The document contains descriptions of 23 child porn sites, forums, BBs that do more than show pictures in some cases.</p>
<p>This document is very useful because it contains verbatim posts by pedophiles that never expected to see the light of day; truly appalling stuff. The document is also useful as it demonstrates the lengths these people will go to. They are walking among us. </p></p>

<p><p>This obviously shuts the investigation down.</p>
<p>What about this: why not make the sub private? Then make another sub called /r/PizzagateKnock or something. Post there requesting an invite and you get let in here. That way it's only the people actually investigating who are seeing this in-progress stuff, not Joe Lurker.</p>
<p>Or here's another example. The SHA256 for the string "pizzagate" (case-sensitive) is b5ac86e24933b6b0bab07f52c5d34bf4a4aef61f8e79f2fd879b5c750fe10987. So take the first 8 characters of that, and make /r/b5ac86e2. Post there and asked to be let in, and you get in. Then make /r/pizzagate private with the message /r/[first 8 chars of SHA256(pizzagate)]. Now the lurkers are definitely gone.</p></p>

<p><p>They do not automatically have your IP, especially if you are using a VPN tor combo. To obtain your IP they use a series of distinct linking websites (honeypot) and check their controlled VPN servers and exit nodes of tor. They then easily deduce who is visiting these extremely specific websites which they linked to reddit on this subreddit. They have control of the moderators in order to freeze any discussion of the honeypots (and indeed fabricate fake conversations about the links to get people to click them). </p></p>

<p><p>Unless you really know what you're doing, you shouldn't be on Reddit expecting to be anonymous at all, especially if you're behind Tor. "They" don't just have control of the mods, they have control of the Reddit admins too, and of your ISP, and of the exit nodes, etc. If they wanted to deanonymize you, they don't need you to click on one of these stupid honeypots to do it. Nobody should have any false pretensions about anonymity on this forum. There are better places to discuss this subject when that sort of thing is a concern.</p></p>

<p><p>If that's what you're doing, I wouldn't be posting about it. How many outlets are sending Tor traffic out right now in the country? One? You just deanonymized yourself - be careful about things like that.</p></p>

<p><p>The standard is not "is the information public"; the standard is "is the person a public figure, and what type of information is being relayed".</p>
<p>It must be stressed that simply because information is public, that does not make it okay to post per reddit TOS guidelines.</p></p>
