     SUBREDDIT RULES
    </strong>
   </h1>
   <hr/>
   <p>
    <strong>
     With regards to personal information of non-public figures; it has been made clear to us by the reddit.com site admins that posting personal information related to non-public figures is against the site-wide TOS. Going forward, this will be prohibited in order to prevent a potential subreddit ban.
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     It really comes down to making sure that private individuals aren't being harassed as a result of postings in this subreddit from the perspective of the site's owners. To that end, I think it's important to recognize that reddit isn't meant to be a place for investigations of non-public persons as they can easily lead to dangerous witchhunting/libel. The proper thing to do, from the perspective of the admins, is to contact law enforcement with any tips that are uncovered to ensure they are looked at by authorities instead of random people on the internet.
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     DO NOT HARASS PEOPLE OR CONTACT PEOPLE YOU ARE INVESTIGATING!
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Please do not start or encourage witch-hunts or doxxing people as that will be the fastest way they shutdown this subreddit.
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Please report anyone witch-hunting, doxxing, posting blatant misinformation, making threatening/violent posts, posting about engaging in illegal activities/breaking the law, concern trolling, obvious CTR, or derailing from the goals of this subreddit.
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     IMPORTANT: We are a politically neutral subreddit! This is not about the left vs the right or any other ideology. This is about good vs evil, the people vs the globalists elites, and this evil crosses political affiliations. Do not be politically biased and be open to new information.
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     IT IS IMMENSELY IMPORTANT THAT WE STICK TO THINGS WE HAVE EVIDENCE TO BACK UP, THERE IS PLENTY OF ACTUAL EVIDENCE LINKED TO CONNECTIONS MADE FROM THE WIKILEAKS EMAILS!
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     PLEASE REFRAIN FROM HAVING DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE HEAVILY ROOTED IN CONSPIRACIES AND HAVE NO SOURCES!
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     STAY ON TOPIC
    </strong>

     COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES
    </strong>
   </h1>
   <hr/>
   <p>
    <strong>
     This subreddit is specifically for discussing and investigating the international human trafficking ring/child sex trafficking ring/pedo-ring that was uncovered by the leaked Podesta/DNC emails dumped by Wikileaks.
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Our main goals as a community are to document the evidence, raise awareness, seek justice for all of the lives that have been ruined by theses disgusting people, but most importantly to do our best to try and save these children who are being subjected to this and to prevent any future children from being subjected to this great evil of humanity that needs to be removed from our society once and for all.
    </strong>
