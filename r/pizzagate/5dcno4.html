    At first this seems like a standard donor email sent out to many potential donors, but Tony seems a little too invested in the conversation with Ken Kay.

     Tony- we were planning to come but the lousy weather here in Chincoteague will prevent that.
     <strong>
      The storm has already taken out a huge 80 ft. tree and the crew is coming on Tuesday after work to finish taking it down. There are two other trees leaning so bad they may have to take them down too.
     </strong>
     We were really looking forward to being with you, but we will have arrange for a rain check (no pun intended). Thanks for your understanding. Please send John our very best.

    Tony forwards this message to John 6 hours later.

    Of course... Ken later emails a picture of a chopped down tree. So I'm probably grasping... https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/35456

   <p>
    Except then I started looking into Ken Kay
   </p>
   <p>
    Found that he worked for Brightway Adolescent hospital in Utah for troubled youth. The facility was closed due to financial reasons, or due to abuse...

     Kay also said in August 2004 during his testimony in the WWASP vs. PURE case, that in his opinion, sexual activity between staff members and students is “not necessarily” abuse.

    Just another pedo in the ring.

    These emails do not sound incriminating

     Yeah, the emails don't seem like anything suspicious. But the information about the hospital in Utah is definitely eye opening. I guess that stupid speculation can sometimes lead to some productive revelations
