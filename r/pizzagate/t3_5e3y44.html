<p><p>What is the best run down of info involving PizzaGate or high ranking pedolphilia? </p>
<p>Would love to see some great info + graphics that can be organized. Nothing that's a bunch or conspiracy related. Just pure evidence, and unamplified questions. </p></p>

<p><p>There is evidence, and it is coming to light, although it's unsure how big of a role civilian investigators will play in this case. Hopefully key victims come forward to identify the perpetrators of this abuse, as the ones that already have are being discredited and swept under the rug.</p></p>

<p><p>I think that you should show them the photo of the kid with her wrists taped to the table. Also just explain the connections between Hillary and Comet Ping Pong. The rest of the information is sketchy.</p></p>

<p><p>There is none. Just symbols looking like other symbols and texts that look weird. People make connections and fill in the blanks. Lots of crying wolf.</p>
<p>There is not a single piece of empirical evidence.</p></p>
