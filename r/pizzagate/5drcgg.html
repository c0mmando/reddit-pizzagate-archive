    To write on a skull with a marker you'd have to clean all the meat off it... then let it be sunbleached and dry... Like I can see killing someone cause they were a pedo... but then to do all the psycho shit required to get you to the point where you could write on their skull... a bit of a stretch... then ya just dump it in the water like yer trying to hide it... why bother writing on it. I wanna see a pic of the skull, not the other bone.

     Well, unless they just did it for personal enjoyment. Like maybe it was a revenge killing because the person killed raped the murderer as a child. Makes sense to do those things if it was personal
