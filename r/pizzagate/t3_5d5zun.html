        <p><p>It just doesn't add up for me. Why are the requests coming from Finland (100% more than U.S., not just a little marginal thing), but during U.S.A. business hours? And that seems like it would be a shitty VPN, if they all end at the same node. Or maybe I just expected more from anonymizing tools.</p></p>

        <p><p>I suspect quite a few  vpns are actually CIA or NSA shell companies for intercepting data. It's like telling the drug dealers here's a safe place to sell pot. </p></p>

        <p><p>this is true! :)</p>
<p>Judging by the spikes in it I'd say it could be a VPN/Proxy thang, but I am certainly no expert and if there is another reason found I'd love to hear it! </p></p>

        <p><p>I think it has something to do with the fact that last year in Finland there was big media hassle about pizzerias/restaurants selling pizzas under 6 euros and police wanted citizens to report those places and the whole thing was also called #pizzagate. It was allegedly about taxes and such but who knows</p></p>

        <p><p>Yea, this is it. The police had a big campaign about tax avoidance in restaurants, how pizzas under 6 euros as profitable are impossible, so restaurants with that cheap pizzas must be avoiding taxes. The police wanted people to report these pizza places to the police.</p>
<p>I think #pizzagate was used to mock the police campaign, as meanwhile other tax avoidance and tax planning causes hundreds of millions if not over a billion euros of losses to the government, and still the focus was cheap pizzas.</p></p>

        <p><p>Unless it's going viral in Finland - which some users here would likely be able to confirm (and help us on how to achieve this in the US) - something is definitely up with that.</p></p>
