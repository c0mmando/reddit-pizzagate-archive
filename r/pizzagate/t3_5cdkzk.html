<strong>James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong is listed as one of the 50 most powerful people in Washington</strong>
<p><p>http://www.gq.com/gallery/50-most-powerful-people-in-washington-dc#49</p>
<p>This article lists him at #49. Notice many other familiar/questionable faces in the article? Tony Podesta is in there among several other persons of interest. Considering we know how CREEPY these people are from the facts and evidence we've discovered, do you think it's a coincidence these people are considered to be the most powerful people in Washington? Why would one of the most powerful people in DC be in charge of a pizza place? There is SOMETHING out there that can give us a smoking gun, we just need to keep digging.</p>
<p>This article says that James Alefantis is the Board President of Transformer, an ART GALLERY. I just read on a thread earlier that we need to be checking into art related leads as a means these people are using to disguise their illegal activities. IS IT A COINCIDENCE THAT JAMES ALEFANTIS ALSO HAPPENS TO BE THE BOARD PRESIDENT OF THIS ART GALLERY?</p>
<p>Just posting this to give everyone some more leads follow. May want to investigate further into all of the other individuals found on this top 50 list, as well as this Transformer art gallery.</p>
<p>Also, a domain search lists someone by the name of Maureen Gallagher as the owner of both cometpingpong.com and bucksfishingandcamping.com. Thought James Alefantis is the owner... so who is this Maureen Gallagher and why is she listed as the owner of the sites? It lists her company name as Kalorama Network Services. Check into this stuff you guys.</p>
<p>An interesting find regarding Maureen Gallagher: Her LinkedIn page shows that she used to be the Director of Research &amp; Member Services for IBTTA. </p>
<p>https://www.linkedin.com/in/maureen-gallagher-18401a8</p>
<p>What is IBTTA? It's the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association! http://www.ibtta.org/ Does this give us a link between these shady businesses and possible associations with underground tunnels used to move kids around? Dig deeper people.</p>
<p>Here is the website to the Transformer art gallery. </p>

<p><p>I thought it was weird power player running dinky pizza place and also tony and john a right up there. Prob why they have been able to keep it quiet. They prob hook their mates up with almost legal teens and film it secretly as well. beween that and their visible influence in Washington, I can see how they could have gotten away with for long.</p></p>

<p><p>If you check his bio, Alefantis has done nothing to deserve to be called that.</p>
<p>He manages two low profiles restaurants, has never worked as a chef in a top top one.</p>
<p>Also, his connections to the art gallery he's a member of is not even justified in his background. </p>
<p>His only capital seems to be being well connected in Washington DC: to Brock, to the ballet stars, to plastic artists. The question is how did he established these connections?</p></p>
