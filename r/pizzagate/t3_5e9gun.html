        <p><p>Satanic Ritual Abuse is the name. Look it up, it's an acknowledged practice. One definite reason for this depravity is a creation of mind-controlled slaves with multiple personalities (aka "alters"), with each alter being trained to be skilled at performing specific tasks for the cult. Repeated abuse and torture splits the minds of victims into as many alters as the programmer wishes, and the dissociative state that a child enters during these sick rituals is used to "install" the actual programs in their head. Research "Monarch Programming" and Project MK-Ultra. A more speculative reason for this type of abuse is to please the demonic forces that these people have sold their souls to. You might not believe in the demonic realm, but THEY certainly do!</p></p>

        <p><p>Legitimately terrifying.  This stuff is real and happening. I don't want to believe it, but the concerning evidence is there for anyone who looks.</p>
<p>I found a documentary on this where a case was busted open yet nothing was done about the satanism aspect. It was based out of the United Kingdom here.<br>
