        <strong>Tips on red-pilling your friends, a course of information.</strong>
        <p><p>Avoid diving into the occult shit, at first at least. </p>
<p>Begin by showing them the IG photos, specifically carisjames, the freezer room, and other children. Point out comments such as "#killroom", "#musthave" and other suspect comments. Then move on to show a connection between comet and the politicians. Perhaps the poster of comet hosting clinton fundraiser.</p>
<p>Next (or first) show them the podesta emails, it may be a good idea to outline what wikileaks, how correct they've been on things for a decade (you could even mention how they're now compromised). Show them the suspect phrases, talking about pizza, cheese, dominos, walnut sauce, and show them how these are used as pedo code. At this point, allow the devils advocate to come out "but wait they're just foodies". Destroy this argument, what kind of foodie eats cheese pizza and talks about dominoes. A real foodie is going to boast about ingredient quality, sources, not boast about fucking plain cheese pizza. </p>
<p>At this point a nice stepping stone is Besta pizza and the FBI fedo symbols, show them how besta has removed the symbol from it's page. </p>
<p>Next reinforce the connection between alefantis and podestas. Then show the links of podesta to known pedos. Show them podesta's favourite artist, and show them the pedo "art" in his house. Find that pic of tony podesta and alefantis together with their arms around each other.</p>
<p>Next I would go to Madeleine McCann, we've recently found info that the podestas were actually in Portugal at that time. Not only that but they were MIA from emails. and the emails were wiped right after and the assistants were doing emails at that time. Show them the police photos, note the mole above tony's right eyebrow in the police image which matches tony's same mole. </p>
<p>At this point if they aren't suspicious I don't know what to say, but all this information is neither subjective nor opinion. You have shown them only facts. Hope this helps and goodluck friends</p>
<p>Edit: fixed for more neutral approach</p></p>

        <p><p>We shouldn't need to manipulate people for this. But, I'd say simply tell them about some weird child porn thing on reddit being vague at first. Tell them to look into it and decide what they think. If you need to refute claims they make, then you can branch off. Starting off manipulating them is futile, quite honestly.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't think this is manipulating. It's  just a way to present the information in logical steps instead of explode into satanic baby rape occult sacrificial mind control global sex slave trafficking ring which operates amongst our world officials we're supposed to trust.</p>
<p>I think it's just better to ease people into the concept that shit is fucked up, get them to a point where they can't not probe deeper</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>Say how creepy it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This establishes how they should feel. You're telling them what emotions to feel. That's blatant and basic manipulation. </p>
<p>Your words are important, and the way you present them is even more important. If you want people to trust you, your first position is neutrality (unless you're an expert).</p></p>

        <p><p>You're right. You can omit that then. Main point I was trying to make is just to provide steps to introduce pizzagate to people. Disinfo is going to be sweeping in full force, counterstories to pizzagate are going to be prevalent. </p>
<p>The pictures speak for themselves, #killroom #murder to a large unlicensed freezer room for a pizzaplace is worthy of question to begin with. </p></p>

        <p><p>Information is manipulation. If I say the price of something is half off and you go and buy it, technically I influenced/manipulated your choice. </p>
<p>The key to the "Red Pill" is that YOU choose to see reality for what it is. It's that simple, a choice. It's easier for those of weak will to bend or cower when confronted with fear.</p>
<p>The Matrix is a great allusion (not illusion) for our current reality.</p></p>

        <p><p>Sadly, it's very easy to see when people are talking out of their ass on this subject. Spend your time archiving and voting/reporting. Stop wasting it.</p></p>

        <p><p>I suggest the wikileaks emails and instagram photos first. Show the emails where CPP was used as a phone bank, fundraiser, trips to whitehouse, 35k for "catering" perhaps. Reconstruct the narrative to be more complete after going through the hard data.</p>
<p>I think the occult stuff is critical, because it has the <em>strongest</em> evidence, but at the same time it is the <em>strangest</em> evidence.</p></p>
