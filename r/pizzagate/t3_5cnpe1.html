        <p><p>they released Guciffer2.0 emails. Contribution levels are related to Hillary's campaign. There is only so much money you can legally give.</p></p>

        <p><p>If you scroll down the PDF loads. It says if you donate $2700, you can go to a "Champion Reception with John Podesta". I have know clue what that is. It might show up in the other emails.</p></p>

        <p><p>That's the point im trying to make. What does this reception entail? Could it mean "pizza"?</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't know. I found another reference to a reception for Champion level donors.

<p>I think it would depend how open these events are to the public.</p></p>

        <p><p>I believe Leslie Dach is Podesta's lawyer.  There are  a ton of emails about Podesta's divorce with documents flying back and forth between him and Dach.</p>
<p>So, while it's possibly connected, you have to look at the background of this also...</p></p>

        <p><p>Interesting.  What's also interesting is that his son was involved in the Columbia/Secret Service prostitute scandal early in the Obama administraton.  Jonathan Dach.  Here's an article describing the two of them:</p>
<p>https://gerardharbison.blogspot.com/2014/10/dach-deeds-at-white-house.html</p>
<p>Creepy looking twosome if you ask me...the son looks like the doppelganger of Dudley Dooright.</p>
<p>As one can deduce, there obviously wasn't a lot of focus on ethics and morality in this family.  Instead of manning up to the crime, the little weasel just laid low and let the administration cover his involvement up.  Even after being outed, he was never fired for sleeping with prostitutes on the job!  </p>
<p>He was later hired to work for the State Dept.  For Hillary.  There's a surprise.  Not.</p></p>
