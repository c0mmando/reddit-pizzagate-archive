        <p><p>I did not vote for him, I don't know if we can really trust him even now, but if he does know what's going on. Maybe he is playing some long, long con to shut it down.</p></p>

        <p><p>I would like to add that I did not vote for Hillary either, I voted for Gary Johnson in the hope of pushing a 3rd party high enough to get federal campaign money. </p></p>

        <p><p>This is heavy, depressing stuff. It is easy to get lost in the hurt and pain, the coverups and believe that no one will listen. I believe our cause can only become emboldened, the fire in our hearts fed by signs that those in power are threatened; and that they are not untouchable.</p></p>

        <p><p>Didn't he shut Epstein out of some of his businesses and cooperate with investigators by answering questions? Everyone else just ran and didn't answer any questions. I think he might be on the right side. I hope so.</p></p>
