    Evidence and speculation, a way of thinking.
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Sorry to make another post like this which is clogging up /new but I have seen a lot of posts lately being downvoted to oblivion that are pointing out what this is is currently speculation.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'd like to remind everyone that right now this is categorically speculation. We have almost no actual objective evidence. We are piecing things together that make a lot of sense but that does not make it true, pareidolia and all that.
   </p>
   <p>
    I hate to say it, but unless we uncover CP in a message, or some hard unmistakable communication between people regarding child sex trafficing etc we will not get evidence, and if these people haven't been uncovered in this long they are probably very good at hiding, even if it is in plain sight.
   </p>
   <p>
    If we all start downvoting people who are keeping us in check and reminding us that right now this is speculation we are two weeks away from people trying to dox the president because he once tweeted about spaghetti.
   </p>
   <p>
    We gotta keep grounded and remember to follow leads based in evidence and based in logic, it's super easy to get involved in fantasy and start chasing every pizza place that has a spiral in their logo but will that get us anywhere? what can we do with that information? We aren't a detective organisation, we can't arrest anyone under a suspicion and nor will anyone listen to us if the only evidence we have is that other pizza places might be a sex traffic op that we have no evidence for.
   </p>
   <p>
    That being said, this is a force for good and I am by no means attempting to lord or shit all over you guys. I just don't want something this good to get derailed by fantasists and 'heroes' that go knocking on these places doors with a shotgun and get us all a bad name and ultimately give people are reason to discredit all of us in a wider view, thus making any work we have done irrelevant as the pedo's will most certainly be shone in a good light as the victim and no one will ever touch them, more so.
   </p>
   <p>
    that's my two cents anyway
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit: I also feel following the satanic cult stuff is focusing a lot on the 'why' when what will help us the most is focusing on the how, when, and where. I haven't yet personally seen any compelling evidence this has anything to do with a satanic cult that doesn't spawn from a tinfoil fantasy, but I am always open for my mind to be changed.

    Couldn't of said it better myself. People are literally typing pizza into google and following the results. 
Every thread you see and post in, try and keep people on track.
   </p>
   <p>
    Completely agree the satanic/religious aspect of this HAS to take a back seat. Everyone needs to stay focused on the CLINTON FOUNDATION, PODESTA.. 
You can already see the majority of new threads/comment arguments coming in are related to the illuminati, youtube music, religion, political side, just all the shit reddit normally talks about....plus tons more. If we are to be takin serious this stuff needs to be put on the backburner and we focus on what we know

    Exactly. It's not the "why" necessarily that we need answered, that we already know. We need to prove "what" they're doing and how they've managed to for so long. We need more damning evidence than  code words and scary art, as good as that has been so far it's not going to be enough moving forward.
   </p>
   <p>
    We need hard evidence, something that we won't find just in emails but in the real world. Physical proof of the wrongdoings and not just ( although justified) conjecture.

    What is needed is the help of a team of experts.
   </p>
   <p>
    Invite blackhat hackers etc to work on the project but by all means keep this place on the down low.
   </p>
   <p>
    Once the evidence exists it can be made publis easily enough.
