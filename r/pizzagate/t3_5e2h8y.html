        <p><p>I would classify this as the kind of speculative thinking that has led us very far down this rabbit hole. It has nothing to do with empirical evidence, but I don't really think there are many real coincidences in the world. </p>
<p>In my mind I preface everything I've ever said about pizzagate with "If all of this crazy shit is true..." I can really imagine him thinking it was a hilarious joke that none of us plebs would ever get, posting it on twitter so millions of people would see it, and only the pizza insiders would get the joke. Sickening. </p></p>

        <p><p>Occult symbolism has been used for thousands of years within the upper echelons of society. A lot of people seem to be new to this whole child abuse stuff due to pizzagate (not necessarily you) and are unaware of the mountains of evidence that this stuff is happening. Child abuse is <em>the</em> big secret as it is the de facto taboo that brings these sick individuals together. Everything from false flag attacks, to hardcore religious perpetuation, to NWO, leads back to individuals with sick pedophilic desires.</p>
<p>I know I probably sound mad, but consider I've been "redpilled" before even modern internet has been a thing. </p></p>

        <p><p>I'm saying that these little nods using symbolism are a form of communication that has been done forever. If pizza is indeed a codeword (no matter how long it's been around) then Biden tacking on a slice in a seemingly random fashion to a bracelet is not a coincidence. Think of all the Freemason hand gestures that have been flagrantly used from the likes of Bonaparte, Marx, etc.</p></p>

        <p><p>Please, don't spread disinformation. The pizza slice is indeed on the bracelet, but as you can clearly see, one belongs to Obama and the other belongs to Biden. Biden's has the pizza slice. People continue trying to drag Obama into this scandal but I SINCERELY doubt it as there aren't any substantial links to him. </p></p>

        <p><p>Why would you give a bracelet with your own name on it to yourself, and the one with your friend's name to them? I'm not trying to say that Obama is a pedo based on this alone but he's more than likely getting the bracelet with "Joe" on it cuz that is his friend.</p>
<p>Also this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in
pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long
ago, assume we are using the same channels? </p>

        <p><p>There was a funny video of Obama and Biden and you actually see these bracelets in the video for a moment. Obama is either holding one or actually making it. Not sure, but why the pizza obsession? I say if you have been to Comet Ping Pong for a private party you know damn well what "pizza" is.</p></p>

<p>It is as if these people are bragging out in the open, because they know most of humanity is in the dark. </p>
<p>And to think of all those little children Biden eerily touches. It makes so much sense now. These are like pedophiles hiding in plain sight.

        <p><p>So... has anyone considered that this is just pizza? Hell, it doesn't even look like pizza, it could be a slice of pie or cake or anything.</p>
<p>Regardless of everything else, pizza is a fairly widespread thing. Not all uses of the word need to be conspiratorial.</p></p>
