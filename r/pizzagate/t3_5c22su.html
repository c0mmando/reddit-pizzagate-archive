<strong>Ok I have some questions</strong>
<p><p>Regarding The Podesta brothers and possible involvement in the kidnapping of that one girl. I am not too familiar with that story but wouldn't it be a simple matter to track where they were in country at the time of the girls disappearance? Also has anyone received any solid feedback that the FBI thinks these leads are plausible at all?</p></p>

<p>Apparently not.  We know from email that at least on of them (John?) was on a trip at the time (don't know where).  We also know he scrubbed his email when the story broke.</p>

<p>Which leads? The pedo ring, or Madeleine McCann specifically?  FBIanon told us FBI found evidence of human trafficking/pedophilia.  I think that's the only communication we've had from someone identifying theirself as an FBI agent.</p></p>

<p><p>Something to consider. If you aren't familiar with the child sex scandal in British Parliament, give this a read: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/06/britain-s-horrific-vip-pedophile-cover-up.html</p>
<p>Outlandish, right? But it's a true story. There are a lot of concerns that what is being uncovered here is so big, and implicates so many people, that our country might be in a similar position of cover ups and uncooperative law enforcement, just like the problem they had in the UK.</p>
<p>If Clinton had won, I don't think it would have ever been investigated. Now that we have Trump in...we don't know yet, but I suspect that if this sex ring is legit, our FBI will be much more willing to investigate under a President Trump.</p>
<p>I remain skeptical of Madeleine McCann angle. For many years, the concensus has been that her parents were somehow involved in her death. A lot of theories about accidental death and then the parents doing a cover up. The similarities between the suspect sketches and the Podesta brothers is alarming, but it could be a coincidence. It needs further investigation for sure.</p>
<p>But I think Ping Pong Comet Pizza Alefantes guy has way more evidence against him. I think that's the one that we have a solid chance of getting off the streets if we can get the FBI to investigate. I just cannot get past the cognitive dissonance of constantly pushing his restaurant as family friendly, having all the musical bands with "all ages" added to their posters...and meanwhile he is posting a steady stream of hardcore pornography on an account associated with his pizza brand. The picture of the girl with her hands taped to the table is especially alarming. And the fact that these all ages bands have very sexual lyrics, some even referencing child sex abuse, if you delve into them further. The sexual innuendo on graffiti on the walls that is posted to the social media account and joked about and praised. I hope law enforcement looks into that guy pronto.</p></p>

<p><p>Thanks for the in depth response! I'll take a gander into that article when I get the chance. For the most part the FBI is as corrupt free is it comes correct? I mean you would hope so I would guess.</p></p>

<p><p>You would hope so, but obviously we know they can be leveraged, because look what happened with the Clinton investigation. It doesn't have to be out and out corruption... It can be as simple as a very powerful person threatening their family if they don't look the other way. </p>
<p>Sex scandals like this have existed within Hollywood, the Catholic Church, and several European governments. I'm sure it goes on in the Middle East and Africa too. Sometimes, when something gets so big, and it involves so many rich and powerful people, it's hard for the good guys in law enforcement to fight back. This is especially true if people in leadership positions in the law enforcement community are in on it. That's how this shit went down in the Catholic Church for so many decades. When the leadership itself is complicit in the cover up, someone really has to go out on a limb to get anywhere investigating, and it often leads to them being harassed and threatened at every turn. You only have one life to live, and it takes a big leap of faith to follow a dangerous thread that could unravel your entire career or result in harm to your family. Sometimes it's just easier to wave it off as a tinfoil hat conspiracy, because it feels too terrible to be true, and who even wants to accept that maybe it IS true and that they are powerless to do anything about it.</p></p>

<p><p>Yea I was speaking to my wife about it and that's the point she brought up about it. I just feel like it's insane if it really was that far up surely one or two politicians who knew about it, threatened or not could expose it and not worry about repercussions. If that truly were the case that they feared they wouldn't be protected I can't imagine how many people are in on it.</p></p>

<p><p>Its the compartmentalized, like the Manhattan Project. 130k people involved in creating the atomic bomb but it stayed mostly under wraps. </p></p>
