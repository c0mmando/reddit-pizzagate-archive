        <strong>Stanley Kubrick's film, Eyes wide shut, highlights the satanic, sexual, & occult rituals that take place for "elites".</strong>
        <p><p>https://www.google.com/amp/vigilantcitizen.com/moviesandtv/the-hidden-and-not-so-hidden-messages-in-stanley-kubriks-eyes-wide-shut-pt-i/amp/?client=safari</p>
<p>I posted this on /r/conspiracy as well. What's interesting to note is, Stanley Kubrick died 5 days after the final screening for eyes wide shut.</p>
<p>Did he reveal too much about the rituals performed for elite players that orchestrate the world with their hidden hands?</p>
<p>The movie highlights sexually corrupted rituals, occult symbolism, and other morally devoid performances that are said to be carried out on a regular basis by many powerful individuals.</p>
<p>Is this movie highlighting a hidden dark side to the world of elite? </p>
<p>Please tell me your thoughts and opinions.</p>
<p>Also I want to add that there are no "elite" people. That's why I put it in quotation marks. It's important not to give up your personal power to enforce the "elites" view that they are better than us.</p>
<p>News flash, we are all equals and no one is better than anyone and no one is worse than anyone. </p>
<p>They may have a lot of money but money is something we give value to. These people do not deserve our individual power nor our fear. Don't give it to them. Empower yourself, not the people that think they are "in charge" of this world.</p></p>

        <p><p>The real question is what was edited out after his death, because there are many reports of it being heavily edited. </p>
<p>Also Sean stone has a video where he talks about this parties being real. </p></p>

        <p><p>This is what I want to know. With what was shown in the film, it's surprising that much was shown. But it's obvious more goes on behind the scenes and I'm curious if it was edited further after his death. There's gotta be more in the way of child sacrifices, (as much as I hate to say this) raping of young children, and other morally fucked up things that make me sick to my stomach.</p></p>

        <p><p>I lived in the LA area, and used to do temporary work in the entertainment industry.  I met a girl once, who told me that as a teen she was involved in orgies with agents, directors, and others in the industry.  She said it happened regularly, and young girls were involved, and that it was still ongoing.  Looking  back, I wish I had asked more questions, but it freaked me out a bit and I didn't really know what to say.  I believed her though.  </p></p>

        <p><p>The craziest thing I ever heard was from a friend, who told me of a guy he knew who went to a party in the Hollywood Hills.  Lot of industry people there.  Anyway, this guy supposedly went into a room where there was a group of people seated around a circular table holding hands, chanting or something.  Supposedly some man at the table's face began to melt/distort, and my friend's acquaintance was scared shitless and got out of there.  Supposedly the guy not only left the party, but the industry as well. Never came back.   I am not vouching for the veracity of this story, it could be a bunch of bs by my friend's acquaintance, but it is interesting given some of the stuff that is being brought up here. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, I am not sure. Couldn't really get more detail, as the account was second hand. The crux of it was that there was some satanic/occult stuff going on, I am not familiar with what exactly the melting/distortion stuff was describing. </p></p>

        <p><p>She didn't give any names of who the people were, but said they usually would meet once a week for the sex parties.  The way she talked, the girls at the parties were in their early teens, many of whom were trying to break into the industry, wanting to become stars. She said her parents knew what was going on.       </p></p>

        <p><p>One of the things I noticed, is that the film 'Room 237', which contains lots of references to how the movie shows how Kubrick helped fake the moon landing and other conspiracies of that sort, was directed by a parent company that's owned by AMC, a company that George Soros owns. </p>
<p>The producer of the film is a man called Tim Kirk, whose bio on the movie site claims that he wrote "the narration for the Hall of the Crucifixion at Forest Lawn in Glendale" <a href="http://www.room237movie.com/about/the-filmmakers/">seen here</a>. It seems, based on the <a href="http://forestlawn.com/event/hall-of-the-crucifixion-resurrection/">website</a> that it's only open from December 31st at 4 to January 1st at 10, that is to say, all night. It sorta weirds me out, and I'd like to hear what y'all think.</p>
<p>Edit: director to producer</p>
<p>2nd Edit for clarity: My idea was (and I know this may sound a little farfetched, but it's just an idea) that the 'Room 237' was a way to skewer people who read too much into Kubrick's films as a way to discredit people who try to find information in Kubrick's films.</p></p>

        <p><p>No no no, not at all, I'm suggesting that Room 237 might be a movie that was made to make us all think that looking for signification in Kubrick's films is something that nutters who believe the moon landing was fake do.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yea, I'm yawning at your post history. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/-sonatine">u/sonatine</a> For the record, I think this post is very relevant and interesting. I am now off to watch the movie to gain a greater understanding of the overarching ideas we are investigating. </p></p>

        <p><p>I rewatched it again myself last week. There is a lot that could be said about that film, it's difficult to know where to begin.</p>
<p>First of all, there are two ways that it alludes to sex with underage children. Perhaps more. First, Leelee Sobieski's character, the underage daughter of the costume shop owner, is caught with two old asian men, and it's later hinted that the owner is actually pimping out his own daughter. Also, she whispers something to Bill Harford about what he should wear to the party, indicating that she's been there.</p>
<p>Bill meets a hooker named "Domino" (relation to pizza or the reference to Dominos in the emails may or may not be completely coincidental) who owns a large stuffed tiger doll.  Keep that detail in mind for a moment.</p>
<p>There are hints throughout the film that Alice Harford may be grooming their own daughter to be the next sex slave kitten, and that she herself actually attends the parties sometimes, but either keeps it hidden from Bill or has disassociated. There are a few ways this is shown, but among other things, again they associate the tiger dolls with the daughter at the toy store as they do Domino, and she also wears butterfly wings at one point, associated with Monarch programming.</p>
<p>There is an unusual detail I have noticed personally, and that is what we don't see talked about on the web regarding this film, as much as what we do see. For example, any image search you do anywhere for Eyes Wide Shut masks, and you will <em>never</em> see certain designs, even though they are prominent in the film. I believe that this is because they are actually used in these practices and it might be censored from search engines. Of course, I cannot prove this but it is unusual.</p>
<p>What you will find a lot of, is the mask Bill wears, all other Venetian masks, red cloak's, and the ones the people on the balcony wear. What you never see, and can not easily identify, are the two which are semi egyptian looking, with a part which is crownlike, and one which has winglike protrusions.</p>
<p>Look up the artwork of the occult artist Dionyso who does the mural at Comet, and you will see a similar look on many of the females in the orgy pieces where they are having sex with demons and... tigers. Tigers are everywhere in his artwork. But many of these females also have wings sticking out of their heads, and crowns. This appears to have some sort of occult significance, but on a deeper level than is easily available to examine to the public, so much as I can see. And the only reason TPTB did not remove it from the film, is that it was so central to the major scene of the film and they would have had to use some major CGI to cover it.</p>
<p>Likely because of what the film does reveal, two major heads of Warner Bros were pressured to leave, since they were the ones who greenlit the whole thing under the impression that it was loyal to the book and its plot about simple infidelity. I believe that they were shocked when they saw the end result. And we all know what happened to Kubrick.</p>
<p>The reason Arrington de Dionyso gets away with revealing what he does, on the other hand, is because it is "art", and besides this, since EWS entered the public consciousness, the strategy has gradually changed, and revealing some of their beliefs and symbolism out in the open has all become part of the game they play.</p></p>

        <p><p>There's more but it would take me all day. I might as well mention though that there is at least evidence, if not concrete proof, in Podesta's mails which goes beyond vague references to food. </p>
<p>David Brock invites Podesta to an "After After Party". What is that, you may ask? Well, in EWS, The movie begins with a party which seems on the up and up, but some people are already going upstairs and having sex, including Ziegler. Usually it's kept well under wraps, but since the hooker nearly ODs right there, Ziegler suddenly has a major problem on his hands since he has to also play host and mingle, or it will look strange.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the context of the film, there is the party and the After party. This is where only those in the know go for the "real" action. The occult ritual and huge orgy.</p>
<p>In real life, David Brock of Clinton's campaign invites Podesta to one of these in an e-mail. Podesta politely declines, claiming "Way past my bedtime". He begins to publicly distance himself from Brock. Probably in part because he may have thought Brock was an idiot for sending him such an invite via email, whether he actually refused or ended up going. He clearly did not want to be able to be easily connected to it.  </p>
<p>So, there are at least a few parallels between a film "everyone knows about" and what's going on today. Just because a person has seen a film doesnt mean there aren't aspects of it worth reexamining!</p></p>

        <p><p>No, but it does have to do with occult rituals, oftentimes involving children or mind washed victims of sexual abuse. Which I believe ties in perfectly with this sub.</p>
<p>Plus I already posted it to conspiracy as well. </p></p>

        <p><p>You don't get to decide what does or doesn't belong in this sub. And if we're being honest here what do you think the consequences are going to be for Alefantis? I'll tell you exactly what: if there are any at all, he'll go to jail for a year or two then come out and start another business and find better ways to hide what he's doing.</p>
<p>If we don't expose this on the largest scale possible then all we're doing is looking into a pizza joint with the goal of 2-3 people going to jail. Fuck that. They all need to burn and you covering for them is suspicious. You and I both know this goes way deeper than just Alefantis and fucking Podesta. Telling anyone any differently is a huge disservice to everyone here actually attempting to uncover the truth. Get the fuck out.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not arguing that it doesn't go deeper than Alefantis and Podesta. That's extremely apparent. I don't see how talking about a movie everyone's heard of does anything to "uncover the truth" as you put it.</p></p>
