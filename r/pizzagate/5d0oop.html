    In my mind this is like a red flag out in the middle of a field. Is there no publication on this or is there an official explanation that disproves it to a palatable degree for most?

     Laura Silsby was obviously embroiled in scandals, defaulting on loans, and traffic violations BEFORE the 2010 Haitian incident, so these would have presumably been on her record? Why would you want to defend this woman?
    </p>
    <p>
     Details on her failure to pay employees, traffic violations:
http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/crime/article24572599.html
    </p>
    <p>
     Interviews local press conducted in the airport when she arrived back from Haiti:
http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/article40706748.html
    </p>
    <p>
     The archived version of the article discussing Bill Clintons comments when he visited Haiti shortly after the incident:
http://archive.is/SNCUW
    </p>
    <p>
     2010 HuffPost (I know I know) article on the corruption of the Bush/Clinton Haiti fund:
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/crossover-dreams/the-clinton-bush-haiti-fu_b_778503.html
    </p>
    <p>
     Haitian blogger who compiled a lot of great information in regards to the scandals surrounding the Clintons in Haiti (2015):
http://thehaitianblogger.blogspot.com/2015/03/hillary-clintons-scandalous-conduct-in.html
    </p>
    <p>
     Leading Haitian lawyer and a genuine human rights activist, Ezili Dantò, charges that UN Envoy to Haiti, Bill Clinton as head of the Haitian relief fund was responsible for some $6 billion of international relief aid received. “Less than 1% of this amount made it to the Haitian government. Bill Clinton had total control of the balance.” She adds, “Hillary and Bill Clinton ‘opened Haiti’ as their private asset to liquidate.
    </p>
    <p>
     $20 million off the book donation to Clinton Foundation, from Carlos Slim (Mexican Billionaire), intended to help Haiti but were it exactly went to help isn't known and isn't publicly discussed?
http://nypost.com/2016/11/05/the-clinton-foundations-off-the-books-20-million-mystery/
    </p>
    <p>
     What I am trying to get at with all of this research is WHY WAS IT BILL CLINTONS TOP PRIORITY TO GET LAURA SILSBY OFF THE HOOK? WHEN THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF NEED IN HAITI AT THAT TIME AND HE WAS IN CHARGE OF A LOT OF MONEY TO HELP THESE PEOPLE? YET THEY FOCUSED ON A SHADY WOMAN TRAFFICKING CHILDREN? OKAY BILL OKAY.
    </p>
    <p>
     I know most of this may not be new to a lot of people here, just gonna keep updating this while I am trying to link the pieces together to possible involvements with a larger child trafficking scheme.

      Also keep in mind, the beyond borders place, across from comet pizza is a Clinton started/ Clinton foundation funded operation that specializes in Haiti children adoptions etc

       Please tell me if my direction here is making any sense. Should I start a new thread for this?
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny thing about this beyond borders organization is that I cannot find actual proof of real life relief efforts they claim to be providing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their twitter account is full of generic pictures of kids and infographics, it seems like they do good work on the surface but it doesn't seem to be of the quality that you would expect millions of dollars to provide...
https://twitter.com/BB_Haiti/media
      </p>
      <p>
       Very interesting article in regards to the LARGE amounts of money they launder through Haiti:
http://africasacountry.com/2015/07/hillary-haiti/
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clinton Foundation alone has directed $36 million to Haiti since 2010. Another $55 million has been spent through the Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund, and an additional $500 million has been made in commitments through the Clinton Global Initiative’s Haiti Action Network.
But what does Haiti have to show for all of these investments? Not much, according to Katz. “Haiti and its people are not in a better position now from when the earthquake struck,” he said. The hundreds of millions of dollars and the years of reconstruction efforts have yielded negligible results.
      </p>

       <strong>
        Unrelated but odd its around the same time Silsby was caught
       </strong>
       Jesuit Priest caught sexually abusing children at a school he
       <em>
        founded
       </em>
       (a lot of money needed for that?? where did he get that much money?) in Haiti. 
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/douglas-perlitz-sentenced-for-haitian-sex-abuse/
      </p>
      <p>
       Justice was served, this guy had 48 million in assets though, which is thank goodness being distributed to the victims, but still I am working hard on the connections here....
https://www.justice.gov/usao/priority-areas/victims-rights-services/services-case-united-states-v-douglas-perlitz
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me just throw my armchair opinion here though... Perlitz had enough money to BUILD that school and then had 48 MILLION left over?? That speaks to me of something insanely larger than just a Jesuit Priest.
      </p>
      <p>
       This man, Perlitz, obtained his grant to build this school from "The Order of Malta"? Which a quick search yields this:
http://haitionetable.blogspot.com/2012/05/shame-of-order-of-malta.html
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking more into any connections with Clintons and this Order of Malta, this website looks crazy af but I will keep searching:
http://vaticannewworldorder.blogspot.com/2012/05/knights-of-malta-initial-membership.html
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you are a member of the "Order of Malta" you are considered a "Knight of Malta"... My tinfoil hat is spinning here y'all
      </p>
      <p>
       I can only find these off the wall websites claiming they know Bill Clinton is in the Knights of Malta.. but they do not have any solid proof... will keep looking: http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/kmlst1.htm
      </p>
      <p>
       It is odd they all have those long black robes so many children have described hm?
In a nutshell, these prominent and influential members of the Order of Malta chose to protect a child molester at all costs and, in doing so, caused the school in Haiti to close and the kids to be abandoned and forced back onto the streets with no food and safe shelter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will keep digging. I am going to focus hard on Haitian bloggers, local newspapers,  as they would be more inclined to release opinions on this family.

        Yeah, I'm having trouble finding any proof beyond the propaganda they list on the website.. It's hard to find many details after the failed smuggling attempt and after what's her name got busted and Hillary bailed her out of Haiti

         Sorry I kinda got off on a tangent there, it just started with trying to find any sort of statement from the Clinton's on why they paid for her legal defense. I tripped and fell down this rabbit hole pretty hard lol

        I do think you should consider making this a post on its own.. I think there is a tie in there if we can just find it. Between the Clintons, Haiti children and what you got into.. If we can find that link this whole case will get a lot more milage tied to them than just the podestas names a lot if I make sense
