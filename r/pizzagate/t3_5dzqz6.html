        <p><p>I created a throwaway for this, as I'm pretty active on this sub.</p>
<p>**We had mandatory counseling every few weeks and a full psych evaluation every six months or so.  Sooner in some cases.  You don't have that liberty.</p>
<p>I cannot stress this enough.  It is imperative to your mental health to take a step away from the computer and regroup.  Forget all of this for a minute and find a happy place.</p>
<p>This kind of investigation WILL eat away at you.  It WILL breed depression, anxiety, paranoia and WILL fuck up your thoughts.  It WILL consume you.</p>
<p>If anyone needs to talk, I'm here.  Other users are here.  Don't keep this all to yourself and don't bottle up how you're feeling.</p>
<p>God speed and God bless, Redditors.</p>

        <p><p>Personally I don't see this as concern trolling. It's actually good advice. Others are welcome to give their opinion, but that's how I see it.</p>
<p>Any of the deep diggers or those heavily involved on this sub can probably relate. Even when you disconnect you're still thinking about it. </p></p>

        <p><p>Bottom line, as with any conspiracy theory, is don't ask questions you don't want to know the answer to. This subject isn't for the faint-hearted. </p></p>

        <p><p>The definition of concern trolling is to manipulate by making one question their own mental health by saying you are concerned this research will make them go crazy and to take a break. I don't buy it. Let's see your badge OP.</p></p>

        <p><p>It isn't concern trolling, it is accurate. </p>
<p>It is good to know others are going through similar things. </p>
<p>Thanks OP, I very much appreciate you saying what you did. It speaks volumes. </p>
<p>Also if I may add one thing that has helped me keep things in perspective psychologically.</p>
<p>It is this:  remember that we are the hunters, they are the prey.  We are not the fearful ones, they are. So fight with a happy heart and a stern resolve. </p>
<p>And if you are a Christian theist, remember death has already been defeated. </p></p>

        <p><p>From Orwell's 1984 - "Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery is torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy everything. Already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big Brother." (3.3.34, O’Brien)</p></p>

        <p><p>When I was 10 my family got involved in foster care with our county. There was a 3 yr old girl who came to our home unable to speak and covered in dirt.  My dad had money at the time and we got her the best medical care and surgery for her bowed legs and she stayed with us for about 3 yrs.  Every weekend the girl.... (my sister in my young mind) would be picked up by a social worker and supposedly dropped off with her mother.  The girl would come back and cry and cry and my mother would say that she was feeling sick.  I assumed that she was in an abusive home. And it was crushing for us. </p>
<p>Skip to this girl at 5yrs old and my father and mother spoke to me that my foster sister would not be with us any longer. I cried and asked why?? My mother explained that my foster sister was being raped and molested on the weekends and my father had filed complaints to the child protection services and they went nowhere. He explained that as a christian he was not going to put up with this and contacted the most expensive lawyer in town and ...im not sure if he filed suit or sent a letter to the county... but he had received a call that if he continued investigation that he would lose his business and that his own children would be taken from.  It was not long after this or maybe before.. I don't remember exactly the timing, that his business was robbed and all the computers and equipment were stolen.  He told me the police had never seen a break-in like it.  They had used a bazooka or explosive to completely destroy a security door into the offices.  Anyway, I reacted to this unknowingly by having a huge distrust and anger towards Adults, authority and government.  I have matured, but this topic is very personable to me and I only figured out recently why i have been so active in research on this topic.  Sorry for the post length. This is painful for me and therapeutic at the same time.</p>
<p>EDIT:  The window is open for all to see. The corruption is everywhere, this time we won't give up.</p></p>

        <p><p>i don't really know.  The social worker seemed empathetic, but did nothing.  Either she was involved or she was incredibly stupid-naive. I honestly lean towards the latter.  Maybe thats why she got the job.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think the bottom cogs at CPS agencies are very well meaning and get into it because they truly care about kids, families, and keeping them safe and, ideally, together.</p>
<p>From friends who work for these agencies at the county level, I've learned that they have waaay more cases than they can handle, spend most of their non-home-visit time doing mountains of paperwork, and are often held back from doing more by bureaucratic red tape. </p></p>

        <p><p>went got some church in this morning been spending plenty of time behind the piano and learning new songs finding happiness in my greatest passion  (music) where i dont have to question if the person who made the music is making me implicit in a pagan ritual. going down to the skid on the 4th to give food and clothing to the homeless.</p>
<p>i think people need to step back from the outrage and think about what they can do to make the world better. thats the best way to fight this disgusting evil shit. be kinder to your loved ones, practice patience, and give yourself time to get lost in something you love/care about. we need to take this and learn a lesson from it. we need unity and compassion to overcome this. </p>
<p>learn from the past, plan for the future, live in the present</p></p>

        <p><p>Maybe I'm fucked in the head because I look at stuff and it bothers me a bit but then I'm fine in a moment when I tab over to Youtube or something and change my music.
I guess some people are more affected than others. Granted I did not click the link posted earlier with actual images of this shit so that helps. I have yet to actually see any abused children or raped children, so my head is pretty clear of that. Can't really imagine how fucked up it would be to see all that. I feel for those of you who looked at it, and especially those of you who are parents. </p></p>

        <p><p>Thank you for addressing this, I feel like a lot of people in this community end up too deep in the rabbit hole and lose sense of what's at stake/how to approach this sort of investigation. I wholeheartedly support this subreddit's mission, but too many people come off as plain delusional. </p></p>

        <p><p>OP, you're in a unique position to get this to people apart of the community that know who to trust. Please use your personal resources to get people involved on the enforcement side that won't turn a blind eye to people above/below them that are willing to knowingly abuse their personal resources. </p>
<p>I'd bet a lot of us have different backgrounds. You may be apart of a small group that can help us not get lumped in with "crazy conspiracy theorists" and shit like that. Please don't ignore this advice.</p></p>

        <p><p>Is there anywhere I can join of group of you to talk openly without the people telling me to stop researching or not take a break at all? There is middle ground. I've seen enough evidence over the course of my teen and adult years that taking a mental health break is not going to prevent me from doing my part - it will in fact allow me to.</p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks <em>MariHari</em> !</p>
<p>More off-topic here, but on-topic PizzaGate, please give us some more insights that come with your background: </p>
<ul>
<li>What is the psychological profile of the perpetrators? </li>
<li>Why is the abuse so often executed by a group of people?</li>
<li>the ritual aspects: </li>
<li>how often have you encountered them? </li>
<li>is it part of a believe system ?</li>
<li>how often have you experienced that investigations are sabotaged?</li>
</ul>
<p>please give us a brain dump!</p></p>

        <p><p>The thought of any adult being attracted to a child for any reason whatsoever is incomprehensible to me. I just don't understand this at all. and if it's not a sexual attraction and they're somehow doing it for personal gain that's even worse and makes even less sense to me. </p>
<p>I just don't know how to deal with this information because I literally can't make sense of it</p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks for your support </p>
<p>with this case, it is good to remember the cautionary tale of <strong>Hansel and Gretel</strong> - be careful what bread crumbs you find and which path you take - take a rest, for this is a very very dark path full of deciet and illusion</p>
<p>be brave</p></p>

        <p><p>This definitely will take a toll on your mental health.  </p>
<p>If you are not of sound emotional and mental footing, proceed with caution.  </p></p>

<p>this. Once you've seen a two year old pick up a life sized doll by the throat and slam it into the wall, then punch it in the face, then throw his little body on top of it and start humping it...you die a little inside. Self-care is very important. Please do take this advice. I've been having lots of "rememberings" reading this thread...and to keep it all in perspective is very important. Keep up the good work...don't take it personally...but let the fire in you burn for a purpose. </p></p>

        <p><p>I've learned to take a few hours or days to myself, then come back. Last time I let it consume me, I was up for days. Get sleep, wake up, drink some coffee and dig with a clear head.</p>
<p>I believe you guys will blow this wide open and the MSM will be forced to cover it. Don't let any shills get you down and keep digging.</p>
<p>You all are doing an AMAZING job.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'vs been having some really horrid dreams (of me researching) combined with really interrupted sleep, which is causing a strange blending of what i remember as fact or fiction unless I really analyze it all. Weird stuff</p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks for bringing this up, OP. The first night I dove into this and the dots started to be connected in my brain, I was shaking and crying and sick to my stomach on and off for 2 days. Didn't get to sleep until 4 am because I could not stop reading through all the "coincidences."</p>
<p>When I walked anywhere in my neighborhood those first few days, I was hyper-vigilant and hyper-paranoid. An unmarked van with a guy inside and guy standing on the otherwise empty sidewalk in front of me, with no one else around, had me preparing myself to run and scream at the top of my lungs if they laid a finger on me.</p>
<p>The psychological ramifications of flipping your whole world upside down to understand/believe all of this are real. At this point, a few weeks into it, I'm stronger and in more of a righteous warrior mode, fighting evil with compassion and intelligence and my Google prowess, but I'm a changed person. I used to be very trusting and somewhat naive, and I don't necessarily like that I'm paranoid and second-guessing long-trusted institutions all around me now. It's not a good feeling, but I do think it's good. </p>
<p>I'm lucky in that my SO did not take much convincing to look into this himself and agree that there's something to all of these connections. That support has been invaluable and I recommend that everyone find at least one person (probably someone who has spent a lot of time on the Internet so that they understand and appreciate the discoveries made on 4chan and 8chan) to fully red-pill on this stuff so you can talk with them when you're feeling especially sick or crazy.</p></p>

<li>Provide suggestions how people can protect themselves who have stumbled across garbage.   I've already established that I'm not clicking shit on this forum anymore; but for the daring people trying to get to the bottom of this, they deserve some council on how to protect themselves legally</li>
