        <p><p>Having sex with kids is the ultimate secret of the elite it's what they all get off on and the FBI's job is to keep it all covered up. This is a huge global business just as big as the worldwide narcotics industry. The CIA protects the drug dealers and probably the high level pedophiles as well. Clintons and Bushes are involved in both kids and drugs and there is no way anyone in law enforcement will do a thing to bust this racket. There is too much money involved and it's too explosive to bring down. The best that can be hoped for is continued exposure on alternate websites so that some people learn the truth this way. </p></p>

        <p><p>Nypd is the best bet imo. Several articles said they had proof of underage sex on wieners laptop and they were set to make arrests until the DOJ squashed them. I send them shit at least twice a day with this stuff. Maybe if enough people do it someone will leak. </p>
<p>Aside from that the best bet is people coming forward.</p></p>

        <p><p>That was an FBI agent... </p>
<p>So I agree with OP... but I'm sure at least some are getting tired and are actually helping us out... maybe they can't expose them publicly, but they can give US evidence so the world can know... </p>
<p>This pedoshit has been going forever... but as for now... it's the only time there has been an incredible and increasing interest in the common public to know about it...  if you think about it, it's crazy... there have been many many documentaries and testomonies of this rituals/abuse but it always headed end way. This is the first time that this topic's interest is actually INCREASING... INTERNATIONALLY... we ARE getting sick and tired of this...
Who knows... maybe this is the time this shit gets really exposed ? </p></p>

        <p><p>Plus it's come out that the FBI has been running 23 child pornography sites to "crack down on pedophiles"...</p></p>
