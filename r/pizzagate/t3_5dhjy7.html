        <p><blockquote>
<p>The law is described as a response to the Magnitsky bill in the United States</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This bill is discussed at length in the book Red Notice by Bill Browder. I read it early last year just before I started to "wake up" and realize how much of the information I was taking in about the world was some form or another of propaganda. The author is a hedge fund billionaire popular with the Davos/Washington circles. The book paints the law as a coldhearted Putin taking out revenge on US sanctions by denying poor and sick children access to quality US-based medical care. The angle taken by the author had a very strong emotional appeal, truly depicting Putin as a heartless monster.</p>
<p>But consider it as "a response to the Magnitsky bill", which was a direct rebuke at high ranking Russian officials and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitsky_Act">"prohibited their entrance to the United States and their use of its banking system"</a>. Now we're talking about a very high level of cronyism with these Russian officials, who were not necessarily using the "banking system" for legitimate purposes and were more or less laundering money through it. This is proven out very explicitly in the book.</p>
<p>But ask yourself, <strong>WHY</strong> did Putin tack on an <em>orphan adoption restriction</em> on such a seemingly unrelated piece legislation, which primarily served to freeze assets, restrict visas, and suspend American political NGOs (the social/financial weapon of the western elite)? Who exactly was Putin taking his revenge on here? If you assume that "a response to the Magnitsky bill" would be a counter-attack at the high ranking Russian officials' comparably high ranking United States counterparts, the fact that Putin included an adoption restriction is highly disturbing in context with our Comet Pizza discoveries. </p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Also want to note that the book describes certain high ranking US officials as being <em>very</em> hesitant to support the Magnitsky bill, most notably Skull &amp; Bones 322 John Kerry who was very active in trying to stop it. Did Putin forewarn him of this very retaliation measure? </p></p>

        <p><p>Interesting. To play devil's advocate, Putin may have wanted to gloss over the orphan problem in Russia. "We don't need your Western welfare. We can provide for ourselves," sorta thing. I would REALLY like the angle suggested here to be true. I'll keep an eye out for tie-ins. </p></p>

        <p><p>Honestly, I know a guy who adopted a kid from Russia and this whole thing seemed more like a fuck you from Putin that revolved around "Western decadent" culture, i.e. homosexuality, etc. I'm seeing more reading into things on this sub lately and less digging for actual evidence.</p></p>

<p>Sorry, I didn't realize you knew a guy who taught you it was just about "decadence" and the gays. Next time I'll stop trying to think and just ask if you know any guys with the answers.</p></p>

        <p><p>It is hard to ignore msm even though you know they lie. Ordinarily you would be correct. Cruz for example ran as an outsider but would absolutely be appointing nothing but insiders and lobbyists. I've followed politics very closely for two decades and I think Trump is different. I've never said that before about any politician. </p>
<p>Don't listen to msm they are motherfuckers</p></p>

        <p><p>I think it's ridiculous if you think either Trump or Putin are heroes and will change anything. </p>
<p>Putin did this to spite the West, nothing else. </p>
<p>Trump will almost certainly change nothing when it comes to this kind of stuff. If he wants to b president, he's going to play ball and go along with Washington politics. </p></p>

        <p><p>Don't you think it's strange that Russia banned ONLY US citizens from adopting Russian children. Why didn't he just ban the adoption of children to other countries as well?  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.ktk.kz/ru/news/video/2016/10/10/72822">Or how about the fact that Kazakhstan a close ally of Russian, also banned adoption of its children to USA.</a>  </p>
<p>Translated from what it says.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Kazakh government does not intend to lift the ban on adoptions by US citizens as long as the US government did not fulfill a number of conditions. The most important of them - to provide timely official Astana detailed information about each adopted child. Today, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic said that Washington is unable to provide it.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They clearly stated. They want information provided on every single Kazakh child adopted to USA. Their status and well-being.   </p>
<p>In the video they talk about an 8 year old Kazakh girl and 13 year old boy who were regularly raped by their adopted parents. Another pair of adopted Kazakh boys were killed by their adopted father. </p>
<p>Russia and Kazakhstan are in close ties with each other and share secrets. Let me just spill in another conspiracy. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-23/kazakhstan-russia-add-to-gold-reserves-as-central-banks-buy">Russia and Kazakhstan have been buying and raising its gold reserves for the past 3-5 years</a></p></p>
