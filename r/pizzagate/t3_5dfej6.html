        <p><p>Doesn't really matter whether they are reptilians or not. It's about their actions. But tbh at this point it wouldnt surprise me if we are slaves to diabolical aliens.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well it's an unsolicited email to Podesta, from a random nobody in Canada. Podesta's Georgetown email address was not a secret, so he got lots of emails from randos. </p>
<p>Show me a reply from Podesta to that guy, and then you've got something. </p></p>

        <p><p>Are you implying that the unsolicited email to Podesta (not from him) that mentions alien overlords was essentially spam and therefore can't be trusted? I searched for common spam terms, like "enlarge your penis" (also the "pen1is" variant) and did not find even one spam email that Podesta received or sent in the entire WL archive. The statistics basically rule out that this message was spam, unless you believe that this is coincidentally the only spam message out of all of those thousands of emails, or that <em>post hoc ergo proper hoc</em>. </p></p>

        <p><p>Not spam as in dick pills but as in unsolicited emails from potential crackpots. </p>
<p>Again, if Podesta replied or forwarded this email, or if you could link it to some action Podesta took as a result, then you would have something. Otherwise all you have is an email written by a rando. </p></p>

        <p><p>Welcome to this sub! Now that you've made your first post, I'll let you in on a poorly-kept secret: 90% of posts here are shitposts -- most from cranks who are trying to see if they can create a scandal from whole cloth, and the rest from people who like to poke at the first group. Both groups are looking for people just like you!</p></p>

        <p><p>Icke has spoken about this before. As we are beings of energy, we create and output certain levels of energy on different frequencies depending on our intentions and actions.</p>
<p>Icke believes that there are entities that exist outside of our range of visible light which feed on the (negative) energies of man.</p>

        <p><p>The Bible has everything you need to know. Believe me, I was a skeptic for so long...
Open up the Scriptures and it's like coming home...LOL best way I can describe it...that book has everything you've been missing your whole life</p></p>

        <p><p>You don't wonder why 22 countries spend 7 billion Euros to build the LHC at CERN when all they had to do to observe antimatter would have been to swap out a lens in a telescope?</p>
<p>I don't comment on the physics the video presents, because I don't know enough about quantum mechanics. But as far as I'm aware, there is no such a thing as an anti-photon.</p>
<p>Edit: https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=anti-photon&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all</p>
<p>There you go. You didn't even spend 5 minutes thinking about this video, because the theory falls apart within 5 minutes of research, no matter how many degrees that guy has in nuclear science. Excellent critical thinker you are.</p></p>

        <p><p>Your right.</p>
<p>Not necessarily anti matter.</p>
<p>But he is seeing something.</p>
<p>And according to observers they seem ntelligent.</p>
<p>Edit.</p>
<p>From google.</p>
<p>A photon is an uncharged particle which is not made up of subparticles (unlike the neutron). It is indistinguishable from its antiparticle, that is to say a photon is its own antiparticle. If a positron changes energy levels, photons will be emitted. Photons are their own anti-particles.</p>
<p>So is there such thing as an anti photon?</p>
<p>Yes and no?</p></p>

        <p><p>As far as I understand it, when a particle turns into an antiparticle, its quantum characteristics flip into the other state (eg a positive charge of 1 becomes a negative charge of -1).</p>
<p>Photons however have all quantum characteristics at 0 already in both states, so when they turn from/to an antiparticle, they go from +0 to -0. Which means that a photon is it's own antiphoton, with the same characteristics. And this means, both antiphoton and photon behave the same when refracting in a lens.</p>
<p>This renders the hypothesis the guys in the video proposed moot. If I actually got this right and it's really such a basic error, then this also puts everything else they say in that video into question.</p>
<p>Edit to add:<br>
Q: But wouldn't the refraction characteristic of the photon flip?<br>
A: Refraction isn't a characteristic of the photon, it's a characteristic of the medium the photon hits. Since photon and antiphoton are essentially the same thing, they would also behave the same when refracting from the same medium.</p></p>

<p>Holy shit dude I'm legit baffled</p>
<p>There must be entities that exist outside of our range of light that feeds on the positive energy of men then or Angels. I sound crazy but I'm starting to believe everything now. This is just too much, its like I took 7 red pills....</p></p>

        <p><p>You know all those people who see "aliens"?  </p>
<p>They saw something, but it wasn't a space man.  Many Christians wonder why demonic possession/torment was common in the Bible but "never happens in the West".  No, instead we have thousands and thousands of people who get visited in night and terrified of shapeshifting creatures from "someplace else".   That "someplace else" is the spiritual dimension, not another planet.  </p>
<p>Another very common report from people tormented by them is that they disappear after a person becomes a Christian.  Many others report the beings immediately flee the name of Jesus. </p></p>

        <p><p>They put the aliens in to make the whole thing look ridiculous, so you dismiss the whole story even though the child sex trafficking and murder is the truth. Icke is an agent.

        <p><p>So many things out there that if true, would be so crazy. It's hard to discern the truth. I will never understand why people make this stuff up tho. At any rate , what the hell did I just read. I do believe there's something going on with a moving magnetic field that lets us harness cosmic power and or transport stuff </p></p>

<p><strong>Plus, with the magnetic north pole moving towards the equator, we need help. If we can find allies that can help we would welcome it. Or in 20+ years we will all be dead anyway.</strong></p></p>

        <p><p>They are demonic. UFOs, aliens, all of it - demonic. The "200 entities" spoken of in Genesis (and now the Presidential transfer of power documents have used this exact terminology, look it up, 200 frickin' "entities"!) have had thousands of years to perfect their deceptions on humankind, OK? Research Bill Cooper, who was killed because he realized at the end of his life the true nature of what "aliens" and UFOs actually are.</p>
<p>Jesus called Lucifer/Satan/the devil "The Prince of the Principalities of the Air" and "god of this world"...meaning the old serpent isn't in Hell as most believe, but in the Second Heaven - which is Earth-bound and apart from the Third Heaven, where God resides. Satan's in the air, in our skies, and "roams to and fro on the Earth." He's trapped under the firmament with us, in the AIR and ON THE EARTH. He's trapped here. That's why you see so much symbolism of "breaking the glass ceiling" in every facet of life - his ultimate goal is breaking out of here and back to Heaven. What he thinks will happen if he succeeds I don't know, killing God? LOL good luck with that...</p>
<p>Anyhoo, UFOs are demonic manifestations, and some are actual physical technology that's been given to the upper echelons of society since the beginning of humankind. The fallen and demons/unclean spirits/dark entities are not of this world, therefore are "alien" by definition. They've just morphed their physical manifestations into what modern society will accept - even atheists accept the "alien saviour" ideology - Star Wars and Star Trek, etc. have all psychologically prepared us for accepting demons. It's sick.</p>
<p>There are ALWAYS corrupt humans who will develop technology for the fallen angels since they can't physically do it themselves. ALWAYS. Every ancient civilization has evidence of "fallen angel technology" and God has always wiped them the fuck out. 
Many, many things will come into the light now, just as the Bible promised, and it's happening NOW. </p>
<p>Get right with our Father God, people...our Creator, the Most High elohim...beg His forgiveness because like it or not, He is real.</p></p>

        <p><h1>Upvote! ^</h1>
<p>This is some seriously red-pilled stuff.</p>
<p>I think Icke has done some good work, but some of it is thin and poorly reasoned. I also think he had a chip on his shoulder about Christianity, and unwittingly dabbles in the hobbyist versions of witchcraft ("new age" thought, etc.)</p>
<p>This is actually a big problem in communities that take this subject matter seriously - many (most?) sadly ignore that satan doesn't simply appear as a <em>beast</em>, but also as an <strong>"angel of light."</strong> He's got a racket on both sides!</p>
<p>"White magic" is fundamentally immersed in the same Promethean "I will ascend" attitude as "black magic." BOTH are deceits, and opposed to the spirit of the <em>First Commandment.</em></p></p>

        <p><p>It says right in Revelations in that in the last days, evil spirits will appear "as frogs" to the "kings of the earth" and gather them for battle against the people of God.</p>
<p>When Icke says the world elites either are, or are talking to, evil reptiles, as a Christian I don't think that man is crazy for a moment.</p></p>

        <p><p>I struggled with believing in God most of my childhood. Even though I went to church almost every Sunday I couldn't stand it, my family fought on the way to church, being in church always freaked me out as a kid. A bunch of people worshipping a dead dude just didn't make sense to me and was honestly really fucking creepy to me.</p>
<p>I'm now 26 and I don't see myself goin back to church anytime soon, not to mention I got my degree in geology where most of my religious questions about earth were answered.</p>
<p>I've always known about these reptilian etc conspiracies since high school and honestly it didn't surprise me, and doesn't get me that fired up. I don't want to get right with God to be honest, pretty much far gone at this point.</p>
<p>I love life I try and help people each day, I don't judge or anything like that but I'm not gonna just start worshipping an entity. So I guess I'll be dead soon? </p></p>

        <p><p>Grew up Mormon but am no longer a part of the religion due to my personal concerns with organized religion in general. I took a lot of the teachings with me though, it truly does teach some great stuff. They are spot on with how the world is trying to destroy the family and the spirit, however I do disagree with their solutions too the problem however.</p></p>

        <p><p>Nope. He means Reptilians.</p>
<p>It sounds like I'm bashing him for it but I'm not. I actually know his theory well. </p>
<p>It's basis stems from the prevailing serpent/reptile theme associated with "Gods" of ancient worlds or religions, Dragon emperors, Elite ruling families (blue-bloods) and the theology of Dragons being a global theme before sea faring showing there is a root link. </p>
<p>The shape-shifting part is what seems to make it a joke but it's being backed up evermore as science progresses - i.e. parallel universes, multi-dimensions, string theory etc all make it plausible.</p>
<p>But first - Clinton Foundation Corruption</p>
<p>Then- Pizzagate </p>
<p>Finally - Your current beleif system can get BTFO</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, it is funny to see the lunatic fringe conspiracies of yesteryear coming back during this investigation... On the ritual abuse, pedo-shit, these "loonies" were not far off.  Shapeshifting Reptillians, Illumanati, blah, blah, blah -- all that stuff may just as well be disinformation anyways.  </p>
<p>I think it is clear from Pizzagate, the BBC shit in the UK, and the Clinton's affinity for Epstein, that all these old conspiracies about a secret society of elite pedos is actually true.</p></p>

<p>Also, I don't think it's outlandish to discredit someone who thinks people are lizards and shapeshifting lol. Not every idea gets to be taken as "plausible" simply because it's an idea. Outlandish claims require outlandish evidence. </p></p>

        <p><p>He doesn't. He thinks they are manipulative targets.</p>
<p>And I'll humour you with a summary of his <strong>theory</strong> - I never said it was true or that I believed it but only that I am aware of it. Consideration costs nothing.</p>
<p>Firstly, the multi-dimensional universe. (Outlandish Physics Claims)</p>
<p>This is difficult to grasp conceptually - i.e. try to envision a  4D object. You would be able to see all sides of an object at the same time.</p>
<p>In a multidimensional universe one dimensional being (3D) could exist in the same "space" as another dimensional being (4D) without interfering with each other or having any influence.</p>
<p>But what if you could jump that dimensional barrier? Would you enter a 4D world as 3D being or enter a 3D world as a 4D being? 
What about 2D? You can imagine that easily, but how would you exist 2-dimensionally?</p>
<p>Ickes theory is the "lizards" exist in a dimension close to ours (the lower 4th as opposed to our 3rd).</p>
<p>These Reptilians can cross that barrier to such a degree that it allows control and manipulation of people. Not everyone is susceptible, in-fact very few, and the people they "control" need to carry a certain genetic code to allow the cross-dimensional influence (DNA being a receiver-transmitter of frequency to allow this). Thus interbreeding of the aristocracy throughout the ages was needed to keep a 'pure' bloodline. </p>
<p>Ever heard of the 13 bloodlines that rule the world? </p>
<p>The Royal families of Europe were all cousins, and still are, and the concept of Monarchies allowed the same families to reign for generations. Controlling these people controls the populous. </p>
<p>String theory</p>
<p>Everything in the universe is made up of vibrating strings.</p>
<p>Every vibration has a frequency.</p>
<p>You are a vibration. You have a frequency.</p>
<p>This control 'lizards' have over people is done via tapping into low frequency "energies" of their Base Chakra - yes, it has now wondered from science into the spiritual. Or perhaps connected the two!?</p>
<p>Low frequencies are generated from negative emotions such as fear, anger and hate etc. (something, something, darkside). We are kept in a  constant state of fear from terrorism or war to help 'feed' the lower 4th dimension. Human emotions become the 'food source' or energy source. </p>
<p>Yes, i know, it's the same concept used in Monsters Inc.</p>
<p>Remember: It's all just a vibration frequency, they can interact with these vibrations in a way that is difficult to visualise. </p>
<p>When this base chakra connection is strong and pushes through the dimensional barrier it is possible to see a 3D manifestation of the 'Reptile' in place of the Human they are 'possessing'. This is what people who witness this describe as a 'shape-shift'.</p>
<p>This allegedly happens during child sacrifices and rituals due to high concentration of negative emotions.</p>
<p>Now we're back to the purpose of Pizzagate.</p>

        <p><p>I'm aware of all of that and none of it is evidence - it's just leaping from one implausible and unprovable point to another. It's a gigantic "what if..." scenario that just keeps saying "okay, now if that <em>is</em> true, now what if..." - it's ridiculous, in other words. His ideas have no merit and he's a goddam looneytoon.</p></p>

        <p><p>Lol.</p>
<p>I used to watch conspiracy vids because they were hilarious.  The lizard ones are usually based around extra reptile eyelids revealed on a news anchor in slow motion during a broadcasting glitch.</p>
<p>The absolute best best best one is Rumsfeld.  Apparently there's some origin story of lizard people that says they can't deny being lizard people.  I guess strict lizard entrapment laws.</p>
<p>Some dude asks Rumsfeld if he's a lizard person at a press conference.  Rumsfeld dodges the question!!!!! It's great.</p>
<p>Although after this election, who knows.  I 75% believe they whacked Scalia.</p></p>

<p>It is pretty great how Rumsfeld completely just dodges it.</p></p>

        <p><p>I assume you have gone over and analyzed hours and hours of footage?...Those links are a "start" down the rabbit hole.</p>
<p>But you are free to go back to sl33p and WAKE UP in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe and the only care you will have is how many points did Lebron score yesterday...</p>
<p>TV and sports is called "programming" for a reason.  Your mind and emotions are controlled and manipulated and you are programmed to think and believe a certain way.   If there are alien overlords you can bet they dont want you questioning anything especially your reality.</p></p>

        <p><p>The issue is with the <strong>structure</strong> of the argument, not the argument itself. Thus, the parent was saying that the <em>structures</em> of these two example arguments were the same. I.e. does it matter if someone is correct about the sun rising tomorrow, if their explanation for it is that a giant cosmic unicorn pushes the sun up every morning? Basic philosophy 101 stuff.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't believe in his reptile alien theories and his other ideological stuff. But his elite pedophile claims have been proven right many times. From <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/06/britain-s-horrific-vip-pedophile-cover-up.html">Thatcher's pedophile ring</a> to <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/25/damning-report-on-jimmy-savile-sex-monster-of-the-bbc.html">Jimmy Savile</a>, whom Icke named explicitly before the whole story went public. </p>
<p>I remember in 2012, Icke said that the whole Mayan 2012 prophecy was a sham, but that 2016 - 2017 would be a time of great change and elites crimes being uncovered. (see this video from 2010: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr11rzS76x4)</p></p>

        <p><p>Has it occurred to you that David Icke may be a PsyOps disinformant, and that maybe he talks about global pedophile rings AND "lizard people" so that when anybody of sound mind investigates these claims (pedophile ring), they will immediately think it's nonsense (because lizard people).</p></p>

        <p><p>That's exactly the way I see David Icke. I remember when I was 15 I was watching a series of different videos about 9/11, and beginning my descent down the rabbit hole that I'm now 5 years deep in, but I stumbled upon the reptilian theory. He said that the moon wasn't actually a giant rock orbiting the earth he said it was a satellite created by these reptilian aliens that used it to emit a signal that blocked the human brain from seeing into the dimension required to expose them (some "They Live" type shit). He's like a 2nd Alex Jones. He's the controlled opposition. He says some truth here and there and then spurts out a ton of bullshit to discredit the truth he exposes. A friend of mine used a good analogy, he said "chew the meat, spit out the bones."</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm part American Indian and plenty of Natives believe that people are shapeshifters, in not just reptiles, but bears, foxes, deer, and what have you. All I know is that I as well as my mother and grandmother have seen some freaky stuff out in the desert in Nevada. Who knows what the truth is?</p></p>

        <p><p>It's Jews. Pizzagate is Blood Libel, which is the reason Jews have been kicked out of various places at least 109 times. The whole (((Reptilian))) thing is to distract from the Jewish Question: Jews acting to bring about a world government run by Jews.</p></p>

        <p><p>the whole alien lizards thing is interesting because you can compare it to us (humans) and animals, for example to a dog we are gods, when you see how much we have changed the dogs species. To a dog a car is a UFO or a UMO. You can compare it with all animals. See cows or pigs, we slaughter then by billions and a lot don't see any human ever, but they see and live in slaughter houses. They don't know or can even comprehend WTF is happening. We dont even think about that in that way, but how can we? We need food and thats how we get it. So why wouldn't there be aliens/gods, that are 4D creatures or beings as we are 3D and animal kingdom are 2D. And as a 4D being you need food too, they get it from us as energy. And they can travel thru time and do all the wonderful forth dimension stuff, probably have there own 4D problems and stuff to do. So why the fuck would they give a fuck about us just as we give a fuck about a pig/cow or chicken farm. Or dogs or any animal for that matter. There is a lot more to this then my simple example, google it for more. That's why this lizard aliens is so interesting to me, just as the fucking UFO phenomenon that is irrefutably real, there are Unidentified Flying Objects!!! and nobody gives a flying ass about it, of course there are a huge amount of people involved in UFO and alien phenomenon and explanations are out there ( lizard people one of them ) but when you consider the implication nobody gives a fuck world wide, its actually suppressed ;)</p></p>

        <p><p>look I'm not here to post evidence about alien lizards, I just found this interesting since the whole pedo/satanic stuff is just baffling as to what is the point of people to actually do this stuff? Power??? Satanic ritual and abuse of CHILDREN for power??? I know they are psychopaths with no empathy but still why? Who gains what and where? If the whole lot is into that who is blackmailing who? Each other? </p></p>

        <p><p>My ex gf studies the occult as a hobby. She's a full blown expert with this sort of stuff. She said the reason people get into these sort of occult lifestyles is because these people consider it really useful. That these ceremonies, according to her, is believed to increase people's energy and bring them up to a higher wavelength. That the reason you always see really rich and powerful involved with this stuff is because it does help them achieve success. She claims these rituals, when done properly, just itterate on their chosen energy path, and it just makes them more and more powerful.</p>
<p>And that pedophilia has a VERY long history in the occult because they believe the energy from children really is powerful for their selves. She claims it's not satanism, as in evil, it's just occult. That these practices are able to launch the average person to really great heights once they figure out how to channel this energy and empower it.</p></p>

<p>Except none of this is still proven, or even likely. You go deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole because each time you connect a dot you accept it before moving on to the next. Literally an ounce of critical thinking would keep you at the first step searching for definitive evidence. Instead you stumble through, getting exponentially more wrong and detached from reality until you look back at the very first thing that sparked the search and accept it as fact without question. </p></p>

        <p><p>I love how people use the lizard stuff to dismiss David Icke outright. You've got to admit that his stuff is fascinating and does make you think and question the reality that you have been living. As with anything, use your own discernment. Take what resonates and leave the rest. </p>
<p>I've always been surprised that Icke has gone this far without any consequence. Do TPTB consider him such a wacko that they don't need to silence him? Or are they actually working with him to feed some misinformation in with some of the truths? </p></p>

        <p><p>I wonder if they have realized that sometimes killing journalists or investigators gives their info or claims more credibility. It kind of seems like now they just kill people that are close to or already have hard proof of their crimes. William Cooper comes to mind, he predicted that they would blame bin Laden for 9/11 then soon after died under very suspicious circumstances. But it was probably a mistake if they killed him, because it made all of his claims seem more credible.</p></p>

        <p><p>Look up Max spiers, he said pretty much the exact same things as icke but he died just a few weeks back. He was definitley killed for knowing too much, reports of him throwing up black goo before he died and his autopsy report not being released. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah it seems easier to use the "discredit" tactic. Plus, the claims are so outrageous people tend to not believe it, even when it's staring them right in the face. They really believe that the vast majority of people are too dumb to know or care. </p></p>

        <p><p>What I have discovered is that every information source comes in two parts: pattern recognition and connecting the dots (facts, observations). Then comes the Weltanschauung (the story).  I can attend to the facts dished out by any narrator, and draw my own Weltanschauung .  Mine doesn't include an anthropomorphic father figure deity, nor shape shifting reptilians, nor reductionist Materialism. But I can listen to presentations of facts followed by a Weltanschauung sermon and retain my own discernment.  Therefore, I can listen to lots of people I ultimately disagree on regarding which metaphysical hologram they self generate, yet still apply the Principle of Charity to their  empirical assertions.  </p></p>

        <p><p>that the fallen rebellious angels saw human women and lusted after them so much they made children with them? It's the same thing you're asserting. THE SAME.
They want to glorify themselves as "intergalactic extraterrestrials!" but are essentially powerless in the name of the Lord of Lords, King of Kings.

        <p><p>Long time lurker, first time poster. </p>
<p>I must say I started reading these threads just to get fun but everything said here makes so much sense when compared to the "real" news we can gather on the internet. </p>
<p>Anyway, this threads made me think about something I've read a few weeks ago that I first discard as completely stupid but I start wondering right now. </p>
<p>So here it is, if you go to the wikileaks database, you will find the official files of a famous pedo case that occurred in europe in the late 80's (Guy George if i remember correctly). Well if you read this (it's in French though) you'll find -along with all the description of those pedobastards doings- that the police talk about a possible George  Bush and other top officials from around the world in a massive Fr/Bl/De pedo ring...Maybe take it with salt and stuff but this might be worth checking... </p>
<p>Cheers guys </p></p>

        <p><p>I feel like the more and more I do my own investigating into this, that the more we all uncover is just exhilarating and wonder what the Founding Fathers of America felt like when going undercover and fighting for freedom. It must have been the same feeling as this, to know you had justice and providence on your side to expose these corrupt individuals for what they are. I don't call them people because of the simple truth that how anyone can abuse and hurt a small child is a monster in my books. </p></p>

        <p><p>"Reptilians" is disinformation, but the pedo ring is real:</p>
<p>WikiLeaks email from Tony Podesta to John and Mary Podesta: "Last night was fun.  Still in the torture chamber."  Consider this in light of Tony Podesta's art preferences.  His favorite artist is child abuse survivor Ria Pratt, who paints representations of children being sexually assaulted, hung upon walls, tortured, and murdered by adults. Podesta also has a sculpture prominently hung in his living room, modeled after the pose Jeffery Dahmer put one of his victims in.  Podesta also is reported to have photography hung in his home of naked teenagers with their families.</p>
<p>Now let's take a look at an email written to John Podesta, regarding a handkerchief he left at a friend's house.   John left a "handkerchief (black with white) with a map that may be pizza-related."  Unless Podesta had a handkerchief with a map of pizza places sewn into it, this email makes zero sense, until you look up something called the "handkerchief code" as well as pedophile slang/codewords. </p>
<p>Black and white symbolise bdsm and pedophilia, respectively.  Among pedophiles, "map"  refers to sexual fluid or blood (a DNA "map" that can lead to the perpetrator or the victim). "Pizza" is a common code word for child sex or child pornography.  </p>
<p>Emails show ties to a DC pizza place called Comet Ping Pong (owned by Podesta associate James Alefantis, another DC bigshot).  Alefantis has since removed several incriminating posts from his "jimmycomet" instagram account, and set the account to private.  One such post is a picture of a man holding a small boy, to which Alefantis commented "chickenlovers." This makes no sense in relation to that photo, unless we look up the term "chickenlover" and find that it is widely used pedophile slang for someone who prefers boys.  </p>
<p>Now, consider that Comet Ping Pong, Besta Pizza (across the street), and Terasol pottery studio (practically next door), all use symbols designated by the FBI as pedophile symbols.  In the case of Comet Ping Pong, one could call the similarity a coincidence, but it's more suspicious when we find that Alefantis' parent company, Big Cheese LLC, uses a similar logo of crossed cleavers.  Furthermore, there is simply no other explanation for the symbols used by Besta and Terasol.  Besta has since altered the logo on its website, while Terasol has removed the pedo symbol from its web page.  All three of these businesses have connections to the Clintons, Podestas, etc.  </p>
<p>We have also discovered loads of incriminating instagram photos posted by the Comet Ping Pong crowd (in addition to the "chickenlovers" one), as well as an incriminating video posted by a member of "Heavy Breathing," a band closely tied to Comet Ping Pong.  The video shows a bandmember, Amanda Kleinman, joking that convicted pedophile Jared Fogle would enjoy hanging out there.  She seems to defend Fogle, saying in a sly tone "we all have our preferences," and raucous laughter comes from fans in the audience.  </p>
<p>Many more connections have been found.  This is just an introduction.</p></p>

        <p><p>The presence of disinfo shills pushing David Icke and Ted Gunderson doesn't mean pedogate isn't real.  The evidence is overwhelming.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks email from Tony Podesta to John and Mary Podesta: "Last night was fun.  Still in the torture chamber."  Consider this in light of Tony Podesta's art preferences.  His favorite artist is child abuse survivor Ria Pratt, who paints representations of children being sexually assaulted, hung upon walls, tortured, and murdered by adults. Podesta also has a sculpture prominently hung in his living room, modeled after the pose Jeffery Dahmer put one of his victims in.  Podesta also is reported to have photography hung in his home of naked teenagers with their families.</p>
<p>Now let's take a look at an email written to John Podesta, regarding a handkerchief he left at a friend's house.   John left a "handkerchief (black with white) with a map that may be pizza-related."  Unless Podesta had a handkerchief with a map of pizza places sewn into it, this email makes zero sense, until you look up something called the "handkerchief code" as well as pedophile slang/codewords. </p>
<p>Black and white symbolise bdsm and pedophilia, respectively.  Among pedophiles, "map"  refers to sexual fluid or blood (a DNA "map" that can lead to the perpetrator or the victim). "Pizza" is a common code word for child sex or child pornography.  </p>
<p>Emails show ties to a DC pizza place called Comet Ping Pong (owned by Podesta associate James Alefantis, another DC bigshot).  Alefantis has since removed several incriminating posts from his "jimmycomet" instagram account, and set the account to private.  One such post is a picture of a man holding a small boy, to which Alefantis commented "chickenlovers." This makes no sense in relation to that photo, unless we look up the term "chickenlover" and find that it is widely used pedophile slang for someone who prefers boys.  </p>
<p>Now, consider that Comet Ping Pong, Besta Pizza (across the street), and Terasol pottery studio (practically next door), all use symbols designated by the FBI as pedophile symbols.  In the case of Comet Ping Pong, one could call the similarity a coincidence, but it's more suspicious when we find that Alefantis' parent company, Big Cheese LLC, uses a similar logo of crossed cleavers.  Furthermore, there is simply no other explanation for the symbols used by Besta and Terasol.  Besta has since altered the logo on its website, while Terasol has removed the pedo symbol from its web page.  All three of these businesses have connections to the Clintons, Podestas, etc.  </p>
<p>We have also discovered loads of incriminating instagram photos posted by the Comet Ping Pong crowd (in addition to the "chickenlovers" one), as well as an incriminating video posted by a member of "Heavy Breathing," a band closely tied to Comet Ping Pong.  The video shows a bandmember, Amanda Kleinman, joking that convicted pedophile Jared Fogle would enjoy hanging out there.  She seems to defend Fogle, saying in a sly tone "we all have our preferences," and raucous laughter comes from fans in the audience.  </p>
<p>Let's not forget the known connection of the Clintons to pedophila/trafficking through Epstein.  </p>
<p>Many more connections have been found.  This is just an introduction.</p></p>

        <p><p>This was a leaked private email, not government correspondence.  Furthermore, it's only obvious when taken in light of all the other evidence we have found.  The friend emailing John used coded language, and Tony referred to a "torture chamber" which could be read as some kind of metaphor if one is naive to his art taste and all this other evidence.</p></p>
