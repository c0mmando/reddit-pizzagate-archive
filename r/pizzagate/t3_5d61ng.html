        <strong>Pizzagate: What specific order is this satanic cult? Does anybody know?</strong>
        <p><p>I ask because a large amount of anything religious and philosophical that doesn't fall under the 'big three' (Christianity[Judaism falls into this too], Islam, Hindu) tends to fall into the 'occult' category. Due to a thousand year smear campaign on anything that wasn't 'canon' to whatever religion held the block you lived on. Therefore, a large amount of practices a lot of either misinformed, or disinformation agents label as 'satanic' are rather harmless. </p>
<p>When this falls deeper down the rabbit hole, from human trafficking, down to the occult, this is something that needs to be addressed. Otherwise it starts to sound like crackpot rambling (no offence to anything here, I'm saying this from an outsider perspective. I am 110% behind this sub). This also needs to be addressed because some of these orders are very large scale, international even; this makes exposure of Human Trafficking so much more grand on the scale than a lot of you may even realize. </p>
<p>Has any of this been brought to the r/occult community to see what their input is? I suggest going there to extend some of the research being done on this. I IMPLORE YOU NOT TO MAKE THIS A WITCH HUNT THOUGH. Please, be respectful if you do decide to take this approach. Listen to what they have to say, see if they have suspicions of orders that are fronting this behavior, and go from there. If you are a fuck ass to them, you will get nowhere. It's simple logic.</p>
<p>Anyways, I just wanted to see if there was already any orders on the suspect list, or if this has branched out into that part of the ordeal yet. It's just as big, if not bigger, than Hillo-Podesto    </p></p>

<p>/r/occult mod here. You wont get any input there and the thread would probably be downvoted and reported quickly before it is removed. 
But you could try asking /r/occultconspiracy. They are more specialized on this kind of stuff and they may take it serious.</p></p>

        <p><p>Sorry, I'm usually just a semi-frequent viewer over at the occult sub, I never even knew there was a sub dedicated to occult conspiracy. Thank you for your advice though!</p></p>

        <p><p>I've known of the Church of set's accusations for awhile now, didn't know if it was relatable or if there was any evidence linking this to that order. I haven't seen any 'infographics' on this....where can I find the information on this?</p></p>

        <p><p>At least some of them (Podesta and maybe others closely linked to him) are Setian. That doesn't mean they all are. There are left and right hand paths. (hint: that difference means about as much as the difference between democrat and republican parties)</p></p>

        <p><p>I totally agree, that was the inspiration behind this post. I don't want to smear spirituality. And there are lots of different occult practices, yeah. Though I find them at least slightly more well-behaved than left-right dynamics lol</p></p>

        <p><p>I guess what i was getting at with the left and right politics analogy comes from the perspective that both parties are controlled. But the point being that some would identify with an overtly dark left handed path and others may practice something more covert and seemingly "light" centered. The later is what we would actually call a Luciferian. Lucifer being the "light bearer", (though a false light it may be.)</p></p>

        <p><p>ahhhhh. I got you now. I wasn't sure where you were going at first, but alright. I guess you could just sum it up to the dualistic nature of man.</p>
<p>Lucifer was considered the morning star in the bible (oddly enough, so was jesus)</p></p>

        <p><p>It's no coincidence really that they are both likened to the morning star. Lucifer's claim to fame isn't quite the same as "Satan". Satan is the obvious enemy and antithesis of God while Lucifer is attempting to BE God. Still an enemy, but with a different angle. He counterfeits (mimics) everything God does. That pattern can be also applied to understand right and left hand paths.</p></p>

        <p><p>the reference to lucifer and the morning star and the connection to jesus and lucifer being the same being are the product of 5 mistranslations in the bible. Im sure that just happened "by accident".  My finding is that its part of an long running agenda  to dethrone God and enthrone the devil in his place using much the same techniques we are now encountering.   With the realisation of agenda and techniques used to accomplish it suddenly so many things start to stand out as into same agenda.  Also. the representation of satan and lucifer being different beings at the same time.  Its like "they" have created many different groups given them strong conflicting opinions but all supporting the ultimate goal which is to put the devil on gods throne. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, mistranslations... When you consider who all has been translating from the original languages one can notice that there were those involved who might have been more on Lucifer's side than God's. I use lexicons when i read for that reason. 1 Enoch was also suppressed, i believe.</p></p>

        <p><p>Church of set, real life Illuminati, satanists, Hermetic order of the Golden Dawn. They worship the ancient Canaanite God Molech, or Moloch. </p></p>

        <p><p>But is there anything linking them to this? I know Crowley was...well....really into sex, but that doesn't make him a pedo. But I could see where the Golden Dawn is getting flak, since that's where he started out.
Satanists and Church of set both on this list I find a little doubtful too. TOTALLY church of set, but they split from Lavey. why would they do that if they were peddling kids together? You'd think that'd convolute things, and make their op easier to expose. 
Not trying to troll here, just looking to problem solve, and gather info.</p></p>

        <p><p>Sabbatean Frankists, Druids, Knights of Malta, Knights of Darkness, Order of the Pentacle, Church of Set, Church of Satan, Order of the Black Sun, Knights of the Black Sun its a long list.  oh... not to forget the Babylonian Talmud actually encourages this sort of thing. Im sure there is no connection.  My guess is all of the above, im sure i missed a few. </p></p>
