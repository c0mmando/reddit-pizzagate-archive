     Did anyone ever figure out the address they saw in Besta's Pizza that said to leave the pizza box and don't knock?
    </p>
    <p>
     Can anyone confirm the street is Legation St? It's close to Besta's but the addresses range from about 3112 to 4130.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
     Assuming the numbers from the address  stated in the video are in a different order, we can restrict the search down a bunch as it would not exceed 36XX.

      I suspected it was Legation Street. I still have not heard back from Posobiec on getting the right number. I tried to tell him on Twitter that it was likely Legation.

     I haven't posted it anywhere yet but I did determine that the likely location of the heavy concrete demo work photos, are in the back of the coffee shop. Your map helps confirm in my head how this should have looked.

     A back room, used as a private party room. Used to be a metal shop until about 2011. Comet does not have a basement: a lot of money went into pouring a new foundation for that in 2005. That is solid concrete, with nothing under it but pipes.
LRF: Was called Marvelous Market until 2010(?). It's actually a pretty pleasant cafe. No basement.
Buck's: Been around for ages. Started by Carole Greenwood, originally called Greenwood's. She's a very difficult person. There is a large basement here, accessible from the kitchen, used for storage, offices, and a liquor lockup. Was remodeled in 2011 or so, used to be full of junk and was largely unusable. 
Besta: This is a divey, shitty takeout spot, staffed largely by immigrants. Great drunk food.

     the back room is also sort of a "green room" for bands to hang out when the concerts happen.

       the shows happen in the same room as the ping pong tables.  there's a smaller curtained off backstage area just beyond that

     BTW the so called "torture room" that was floating around, from an instagram picture, is in the basement of Buck's. It is, in fact, just a walk in refrigerator, filled with vegetables from the farm and other prep.

        I can confirm r_clandestino's description of Comet. Restaurant part, then ping-pong / live music area, then curtained off back room (#1 on map) with a few tables and a tiny bar =, that's where the bands put their equipment and hang out before playing, it is also rented for private parties. No basement or other floors. The band / private party room (#1) opens out to the parking lot as well.

         you have confirmed his geographical explanation; now go ahead and explain away all the fluffer filler where he tried to claim it was all innocent. you have one post karma, your account is a year old, and your history is: several comments one year ago, a comment 6 months ago, and now this dispute. so understand, I am not going to believe you.

    Google satalite helps - you can match the cooker/chimney on the roof with the one inside at Besta - there is clearly a huge space at the back.

    People should be aware that after people have stirred the pot so much, those individuals who need to be held responsible were probably spending all of their time and energy in an attempt to get rid of all sorts of evidence. They'll move everything that could be considered damning evidence, heck if they're extreme I bet they would blow up the place to get rid of all those tunnels they dug and blame it on researchers to dispose of evidence. I don't know, just a thought. I'd expect it.

     This is likely to happen, sadly. Despite them being fairly sloppy at keeping their little secret going, they've been professional at other things such as hiding the actual pictures and child bodies.

      Trump is fully aware of the emails, as is Flynn and Pompeo. They've all made insinuations about it both in public and on social media. We have support in the government. Honestly I think theyre just bidding their time until they are fully sworn in. They cant destroy everything, and what we have is already fairly damning. They'll be caught red-handed. I can guarantee it.

They throw the raped, mutilated child corpses into the killtanks.
They have baby coffins...

         Does anyone else think all these nutbags suddenly showing up with all the kind of language that sets off people's B.S. detectors is an organized smurfing to make this place seem more crazy and fringe than it actually is?

         Sorry if your comment was meant in seriousness, but you make this whole topic look silly when you bring up

         If you can't suppress something, heap negative social stigma on it and infiltrate some shills to make it look and sound extra batshit crazy and not like anything a respectable person would instigate. Which it feels like you're a part of.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you somehow know this Satanism aspect to be true with great certainty, why not share the evidence? Or failing hard evidence, at least let us know whenever you know.

    Politics and Prose is affiliated w/Little Red Fox. "The Den" in P&amp;P has the same illustrated red fox as LRF business logo has. Also found an article officially announcing that LRF is affiliated w/The Den in P&amp;P.
   </p>
   <p>
    So if P&amp;P is fishy, so is LRF.

    No clue what it functions as normally, but the backroom is pretty benign. If there were kids coming in and out of it there was most likely a party back there.

    Why would the same company own 2 competing pizza stores right next to each other?

     Why would two competing pizza stores be right next to each other in the first place. Comet is a gourmet style pizza place while besta is a subpar hole in the wall that is still in business.

     No one has presented evidence that they have the same owner, and they're not really in competition.

    Hey guys -- I am a regular customer of all of these establishments. I go to lunch at Little Red Fox at least once a week (best deli in DC). That parking lot is amazing (you'd understand if you live and drive in DC). I've spent many evenings at Comet and can assure you that it's a normal pizza restaurant. I've been following all of this for a few days now. I'm a reasonable person and I'm guessing many of you are as well. So please understand that these establishments are normal neighborhood places. They're far from the evil, corrupt DC that I think you're imagining. Feel free to ask me anything, but please know that the people who go to these establishments are normal humans, with normal jobs, with normal families. And the establishments are community based and family friendly -- and that's why you're seeing the response on sites like FB reviews.

     It is most likely true that everyone works there are all well and good, and they probably serve yummy food. Just that the pizza places could be fronts for other more nefarious activities. Just like the stereotype of the Italian cafe, with the mafia in the back. The cafe exists to provide a cover, and also to aid in laundering.

      To your point, there was a restaurant in my hometown in Iowa (~110k population) that everyone considered a totally normal restaurant. One day they got raided and it turns out the FBI had been watching them for months as they had been working on smuggling guns to Lebanon.
     </p>
     <p>
      None of their customers had any idea, but they ran the whole operation right there, hiding the guns in construction equipment from their remodel and food containers intended for Middle East relief.

      Yeah, but DC is a really, really, small tight-knit community and that just wouldn't be possible here. Comet is very intertwined and a great supporter of the arts community here in DC. Some of my closest friends are friends with the owner, and they're all great people who I would trust with my life. Personally, from experience, and the only one here who's spent significant time there, I find it absolutely impossible. Just be thoughtful, that's all I ask.

       I nor most people here, I hope, are looking to go after anyone who works there. The problem lies in the ties with the Podesta brothers and the emails. It's worth looking into and to turn over every stone. If it wasn't, there wouldn't be this many people putting it under a microscope.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. Also regrading the owner, sense you probably know him, whats up with the suggestive instagram post towards children and sex?

       Small community? I would never call a region that size with a population of over 650,000 a "really, really, small tight-knit community."

         At this point I don't know if something like that is necessarily a sign of anything strange. I've seen pizzagate stuff pop up here and there around the web, and the sub itself has grown to 17,000 subscribers. It's entirely plausible that someone who is an actual normal person that eats at these places might have seen the conspiracy things somewhere, found their way to this sub in their attempt to read more about it, then decided to make an account to say something. Or they may have even already had a reddit account but decided to post here with a throwaway to avoid having their comment history potentially dug through by the more industrious members of this sub after they've admitted to both living in a certain area and vising a certain place regularly.

          It's my community. I've never had a reddit account before and I created it because I don't want to see my community hurt, just like any of you wouldn't want to see someone hurt yours. As an outsider looking in, all of this reads like a witch hunt. Truly, I'm just a concerned member of my community.
         </p>
         <p>
          And to the comment about the 650,000 people in DC -- DC is a very, very transient city, so the people that stick around for more than 4 years are incredibly close. DC proper -- especially NW DC -- feels more like a small town rather than a large city. You'd understand if you lived here.
         </p>
         <p>
          Again, just be thoughtful and step back periodically to make sure you're not participating in a witch hunt where actual members of an American community are the victims. You guys do have power and influence, so treat it with respect.

           Could you please care to explain why their website is false advertising that the place is kid friendly when Yelp reviews from 2014 are claiming children were left unsupervised and loud and noisy children were heard and wasn't uncommon, could you please explain how
           <a href="https://i.sli.mg/lu0Uf9.png">
            this
           </a>
           is in any way okay to have around children, and
           <strong>
            NO
           </strong>
           , it being ''art'' does
           <strong>
            NOT
           </strong>
           excuse it, I can't just show a video directly off pornhub to a child and claim what they're doing is art because you know...they're actors after all...right? How the fuck is this place kid friendly with such explicit content on the walls, can you please explain why a
           <em>
            normal
           </em>
           pizza place is getting five figure contributions from Clinton-connected PACs? And let's say this is all coincidence and there is nothing going on other than that these people are just
           <em>
            friends
           </em>
           of Alefantis and donate a lot of money and that Alefantis just enjoys different type of art, can you then PLEASE explain to me why his Instagram has a picture of two gay men involved in a threesome eating a photoshopped Pizza on somebodys dick to later on post pictures of babies in the next posts... ??? Can you explain to me how this guy
           <em>
            isn't
           </em>
           weird? 
And a BIG note here, Im not claiming this guy is a pedophile satanist (not yet), but he is definitely suspicious as FUCK considering the shit he posts and his connections with Podestas and Clintons, infact this only means I'm not 100% certain but I am atleast 98% certain there is something going on.
          </p>
          <p>
           Explain these to me and I will believe you.
