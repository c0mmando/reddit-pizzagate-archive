<strong>How to report a crime anonymously.</strong>
<p><p>Step 1: Identify your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Step 2: Identify the appropriate agency.</p>
<p>Step 3. Identify the crime and the corresponding code.</p>
<p>Step 4: Write a letter to the agency explaining the crime and include any evidence, printed and attached.</p>
<p>Example: James Alefantis has bragged about large amounts of unreported income in foreign currency that was never declared.</p>
<p>Dear Immigrations Customs Enforcement, </p>
<p>As a discretionary reporter, I would like to report Mr. James Alefantis, owner of the Comet Ping Pong establishment, as having committed a crime.</p>
<p>Title 31 U.S.C. § 5332 (Bulk Cash Smuggling) makes it a crime to smuggle or attempt to smuggle more than $10,000 in currency or monetary instruments into or out of the United States, with the specific intent to evade the U.S. currency reporting requirements codified in Title 31 U.S.C. §§ 5316 and 5317.</p>
<p>Mr. James Alefantis has violated this code, as you can see from his pictures where he brags about it on social media.</p>
<p>I am reporting as a discretionary reporter because I fear retaliation from his political allies.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Discretionary Reporter</p></p>

<p><p>Another example:</p>
<p>Dear Metropolitan Police,</p>
<p>I have reason to believe that prostitution is taking place at the Comet Ping Pong Establishment.</p>
<p>§ 22–2701. Engaging in prostitution or soliciting for prostitution is  crime that is occurring at the Comet Ping Pong establishment where there are, according to Comet Ping Pong's own website, secret rooms.</p>
<p>I would like to report as a discretionary reporter to avoid retaliation from Mr. James Alefantis' political allies.</p>
<p>Thank you, </p>

<p><p>Hasn't the theme lately been to not jump the gun? Doing this today could cause problems if somethings found "tomorrow"</p>
<p>I understand it's just an example you're using, not to actually report as you posted.</p></p>

<p><p>Reporting a crime is not jumping the gun. It allows the authorities to investigate to determine if you are right about your accusation and whether or not you produced probable cause to act.</p>
<p>You don't act. You just look for relationships on the Internet to find evidence of crimes. Then, report them. You aren't doing anything illegal.</p>
<p>By reporting the crime, you can move on and the witch hunt never happens. There is no need to interact with these people's social media. Report the crime and move on.</p>
<p>If you did it maliciously, it would be a problem. That is why you need SOMETHING to back up what you are saying. </p>
<p>In all seriousness, don't do it to be harassing. You need to be sincere in your belief that a crime has occurred of significance enough to report. </p>
<p>You aren't a lawyer, you aren't a policeman, you aren't a prosecutor. You aren't an expert. But you are entitled to your opinion and the freedom of speech to share that opinion in, hopefully, as polite of a manner as possible.</p></p>

<p><p>Excellent point, and the pressure they've already felt has already probably started the destruction of as much evidence as possible. </p></p>

<p><p>Dear United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York,</p>
<p>I would like to report the financial crime committed by Chelsea Clinton in which she used $3,000,000 of misappropriated money, violating laws regarding the laundering of monetary instruments (18 U.S.C. § 1956), and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity (18 U.S.C. §
1957).</p>
<p>I am reporting as a discretionary reporter because I fear retaliation from his political allies.</p>
