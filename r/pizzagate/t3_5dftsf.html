<p><p>To be honest, this actually makes a lot of sense because other traffiking works this way.</p>
<p>I work with wildlife sanctuaries, and a lot of wildlife rescue's, sanctuaries and conservation efforts are fronts for Wildlife trafficking. It's a multimillion-dollar backend business. They pick up animals from owner surrendering them, or seize them from circuses, private collections, and zoos and then either sell them into private hands, or they are quickly euthanize "for their own benefit", and then sold for parts, or they are bred and the babies are then passed off to dealers to be sold.</p>
<p>They're never sold straight up, always traded for large donations of either facilities or favors or money. This is a huge in Big Cat Rescue, where tiger Bones skin and the parts are worth a lot of money. government officials are complicit, because they will write the violations which seize the animals, and then transfer the animals to sanctuaries. </p>
<p>There's zero oversight for these rescue charities, the public thinks that they are working in the interest of the animals. </p>
<p>Rescues also promote the idea to the public that exotic pets should not be in private hands, and instead go to rescues.</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents. I've seen some pretty serious deals go down, behind the scenes of wildlife rescue and sanctuaries</p></p>

<p><p>I'd have to assume that a lot of the money donations come in from good people thinking they are helping a good charity... I'm sure they are oblivious as to what is actually going on. </p></p>

<p><p>Small donations yes. Well-meaning people in my experience tend to donate small amounts of money, and items. Mostly items. So for wildlife it's things like food and treats and stuff like that. For children they would probably donate things like toys. </p>
<p>Those are actually well-meaning people.</p>
<p>People looking for benefits will donate larger amounts, but also high dollar value items like cars, facilities like land or buildings, and things like invitations to events.</p>
<p>Donations are never free from strings.</p>
<p>Personally I would look into donors, and also facilities. What kind of houses or offices do they operate out of? Who owns those? Who made large donations? </p>
<p>What kind of events do they hold? Who gets invited to them? What kind of events do they attend? Etcetera. </p></p>

<p><p>I have also, in my investigations over the last 6 years, continually seen references to NCFMC.  I never spent a lot of time, because the conspiracy is so large and wide reaching, looking into it, because I thought it was A GOV'T ORGANIZATION!</p>
<p>To just find out that it is a private organization?  Folks, I guarantee you that this is a gate-keeper.  There is no doubt in my mind.  I want to kick myself for missing it...</p></p>

<p><p>After Laury Silsby's group was arrested, the legal advisor that came forward for them was <strong>actually</strong> under investigation for sex trafficking: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the days following the group's initial arrest, Dominican Jorge Puello took on the role of legal advisor. Puello later acknowledged that he is under investigation for sex trafficking in El Salvador and wanted in the United States for smuggling people across the Canada–US border. Puello was incarcerated for short terms in both Canada and the US. He was arrested in the Dominican Republic on March 18. On August 18, 2010, the Dominican Supreme Court authorized Puello's extradition to the United States where he was sentenced to 37 months of prison in June 2011.</p>

<p><p>So many things, couldn't stop reading. </p>
<p>Wtf about this one, for starters</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Puello said in the interview that he had been representing the Americans free of charge because he was a religious man who commiserated with their situation. “I’m president of the Sephardic Jewish community in the Dominican Republic,” he said. “I help people in this kind of situation. We’re not going to charge these people a dime.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But other lawyers for the detainees said that the families had wired Mr. Puello $12,000 to pay for the Americans’ transportation out of Haiti if they were released, and that they had been told by Mr. Puello in a conference call late Tuesday that he needed an additional $36,000. Mr. Puello said that he had not participated in a conference call.</p></p>

<p><p>I think this is the most compelling chain of evidence. I cannot stress enough how much I think Brock is involved in this. I think he is the guy, that connection that make everything work.</p>
<p>I'm saving this topic because it is clear that child care private companies and government institutions are being used as a front for this group to operate under the radar and focus their operation under the radar of already exploited or abandoned children.</p></p>

<p><p>Folks, I found a connection between the Dutroux scandal and all this.</p>
<p>Follow me on this.  The ICFMEC is the int'l version of NCFMEC.  In the late 80s in Belgium and France there was a big scandal where this guy Dutroux was kidnapping girls and imprisoning them, then selling them.  The officials purposely refused to investigate this until the case blew open, and then the PTB, judges, ministers, etc of Belgium pretty much did everything they could to squelch this.  Dutroux ended up doing like EIGHT freaking years in jail for murdering multiple girls!  And no one else was convicted, even though the surviving victims could testify that numerous royal and elite people were involved.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was reading on another thread (forget which one) about the ICFMEC, which is based in Europe, and one of the people on the board was this Belgium dude named Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer</p>
<p>Well, years after the Dutroux scandal, anonymous published a list of people who were either named by the victims or were involved in the coverup. And who do you see on that list, but Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer!</p>
<p>Here's the link to the list:</p>
<p>https://legswooden.blogspot.com/2014/03/huge-scandal-in-belgium-anonymous.html</p>
<p>The problem is that it's in French and while I speak some spanish from my travels, my French is non-existent beyond sil voux plais.  Can someone help hunt down more info on this Lichtbuer guy?  And the other names on the list?  Are any of them in the wikileaks emails, etc?</p></p>

<p><p>I hit upon this a few weeks back... We're not the only ones that know... There is a very telling pop-up box that shows it's face if you try to transition from any legit government website to the NCMEC... so .gov knows too. </p>
<p>Amber Alert, INOBTR and Coats for Kids are also pretty sketchy. Especially with CFK being based in DC. </p></p>

<p><p>NCMEC&gt;&gt;&gt; They had an event a few weeks ago at ocelot brewery in Dulles, VA...a funky bar that has bands that seem similar to acts at comet ping pong. Prime example: "Jackie and the Treehorns". OK, "Jackie" is not a member of the band but an imaginary evil clown- so there's that... plus lots of occult symbols ...WHY is this band a bar they play at even associated with an org to find missing kids again???</p>

I've notice Art collectors and shows swirling around this whole mess. No secret, and not saying it proves anything but Tony Podesta has an amazing/world famous art collection. Probably nothing but if you walk out of Comet PP and make a right...the next building is Chevy Chase Art Gallery. No website. zero reviews anywhere.

<p>I ran into these guys randomly too many times to not be suspicious of their motives... too many dirty fingers in their pie... but I guess when so many people are trafficking you could connect any organization. </p></p>
