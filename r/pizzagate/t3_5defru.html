        <p><p>Where was it said that she was not? I heard rumors that she was trans days ago, but that wouldn't make her not a woman.

        <p><p>I doubt she's deeply involved but I've been seeing a lot of posts claiming that she's a man.  </p>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/2NdKo">Archive</a> in case it goes down.  </p>
<p>She was using a voice synthesizer at comet pizza as well as obviously covering her face.  </p>
<p>Her myspace page shows her with and without the same ski mask disguise.  </p></p>
