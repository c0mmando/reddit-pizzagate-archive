<strong>the FBI is not going to help.</strong>
<p><p>They've systematically covered this up for decades. It involves the most powerful people in the world. The blowback from this would end the nation and totally change life as we know it. This is huge. Donald isn't going to do anything, the CIA isn't going to do anything, and the FBI isn't going to do anything. Mainstream media isn't going to touch this. </p>
<p>If you're not careful, they'll cover you up too.</p>
<p>Don't publish your findings until you have something air and water right that you can make a million copies of and convince everyone else to make a million copies of. Hard copies, as well as Internet copies. Hell, write a virus that puts it in front of every computer user in the nation. Hand them out like candy on Halloween; and for the love of harambe protect yourself and your anonymity. This will go down in history as the greatest thing to happen in the 21st century but keep in mind these people are dangerous and will spare no expense to not lose their power. They have a whole military at their disposal, and they won't be afraid to use it.</p></p>

<p><p>Never give up hope completely. Good people have cropped up before. JFK started out as one of them, but he turned out to not really be evil at his core, his conscience started to win over and it started to show, but they offed him before he could work up the nerve to spit it out. And then all the way down at the regular civilian level, I used to know a woman who worked with CPS as a cop, and she never bought into the corruption, though she didn't know what to do either and became dreadfully depressed and just quit. But the point is that there is always hope.  </p></p>

<p><p>Pretty sure Trump took a few flights on the Lolita.  Also has associated with Epstien.
For sure they tried to get to him.  Not sure is if they succeeded.  Let's all hope they didn't.</p></p>

<p><p>If they had anything on him- we would have seen it by now.  He was 
probably the only one smart enough to not get involved.</p></p>

<p><p>i honestly think the statement today from Pence saying he is getting rid of Anti Christian law from the courts is a suggestion that he is trying to get rid of this shit.</p>
<p>Saying Hillary would be in Jail PUBLICY and THROUGHOUT his campaign suggests that he is asking people to look into her.</p>
<p>He even mentions wikileaks ALL THE TIME on the debate and asks the public to go out and look for themselves.</p>
<p>he is going to #DRAINTHESWAMP</p></p>
