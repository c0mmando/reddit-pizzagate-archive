    What about Megan Rodham? A Missing Link?
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    So in 2010, Laura Silsby, the director of The New Life Children’s Refuge (NLCR) and nine of her cohorts took 33 children from their living parents from Haiti to live in a Dominican Republic hotel before a new "orphanage" (read: brothel) is built. They told the parents they'd be getting a better life.
   </p>
   <p>
    https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7b31d6687d4f3a32d0978bd73d78344b7b7d21bd0049b0cc78b0f5f7541e383a.jpg
   </p>
   <p>
    The original plan had been to put the children in an "orphanage" in Idaho, and but unfortunately it was already full according to their "pastor." This morphed into the Dominican hotel plan as a result.
   </p>
   <p>
    https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2f3c1096d1717fbf37c08b4864a426a85d5fc1cf1006606cf01135cd1a8190fd.jpg
   </p>
   <p>
    However, they were stopped at the Dominican border where they lied and said the children were orphans. They were then arrested. Here's where it gets really fun. Silsby and NLCR's inital legal counsel is a certain Jorge Puello Torres, who is himself a trafficker. More on him in a second.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hillary Clinton is herself a long term support of Silsby and NLCR. She has fundraising emails going all the way back to 2001 on Wikileaks. So, naturally, Silsby and NLCR reached out to HRC for help. HRC (through the Clinton Foundation) offers aid, and begins to closely monitor the case on taxpayer time.
   </p>
   <p>
    Eventually, in May, 2010, Silsby is the last member of NLCR to be let out of jail, with "time served," undoubtedly with the help of the Clinton Foundation and HRC's efforts.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now, back to Jorge Puello Torres.  Before the end of the case, he had to withdraw because it turns out he himself is a human trafficker without the license to practice law. Worse yet, Torres was wanted for sex trafficking, specifically.
   </p>
   <p>
    Eventually, Torres was arrested in the Dominican Republic in March. On August 18, 2010, the Dominican Supreme Court authorized Puello's extradition to the United States, where he was then charged and sentenced to 37 months of prison in June 2011.
   </p>
   <p>

   </p>
   <p>
    Clinton continued to keep tabs on these proceedings at least through December, 2010, per this heavily Citizen's United exchange involving the Haitian Ambassador Kenneth Merten, Cheryl Mills, Doug Band (aide to WJC) and Huma Abedin. The big question on Doug Band's mind is "what does Megan Rodham [HRC's sister-in-law via Tony Rodham] have to do with this?"
   </p>
   <p>
    https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/afc46701d1264de56973997eb40ea1fc6bd6a83090fbaf0c20f46d7763998ae6.jpg

   </p>
   <p>
    So, it looks like Clinton is actually connected to human trafficking in Haiti (including Torres' sëx trafficking).
   </p>
   <p>
    Side note that may or may not be relevant: the initial email that prompted Mills to look into this case was a "thank you" from Evan Lyons, a doctor at Partners in Health (PIH), which is medical group sponsored by the Clinton Foundation that also worked in Haiti. Megan Rodham is Tony's second wife, and works as a nurse that may or may not have ties to PIH. That email is also interesting in that there is a redacted paragraph thanking Mills for some unknown reason. Could be related to this as well.
