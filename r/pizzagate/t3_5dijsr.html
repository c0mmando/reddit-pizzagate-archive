<p><p>The link is Turkish. I've heard that Googlr translate recently got an update and is okay at Turkish translations. Still the summary is:</p>
<p>If this law passes, child rapists won't get punished if they marry their victims. This law is proposed by AKP (Erdoğan's party) . They didn't have enough MPs to vote today so voting is postponed to next Tuesday. </p>
<p>Personally, by the way they are rushing this like that, I'd say someone in the party is involved in some shit, whether it's relevant or irrelevant to pizzagate.</p></p>

<p><p>I speak Turkish and I wrote the summary from the original text, not google translate. It isn't misinformation. If the law passes, child rapist won't get punished if they marry the victims. It's all over twitter in Turkey right now. There is the official paper for the law with MPs signatures under it.</p></p>

<p><p>Probably. There was the Ensar Foundation scandal earlier this year where 45 elementary school kids were raped and they pretty much swiped it under the rug. Now all the pro-goverment media is making news about pizzagate. If something were to come up in Turkish goverment while they are throwing shit at USA...</p></p>

<p><p>No I don't think so, they don't have enough connections and language. They are just a bunch of fucking islamic rapists who supported by corrupted goverment. </p></p>

<p><p>I dont think it's connected as well. I was just trying to say it would especially look bad if something were to come up while Islamists are having a field day saying how evil the west is.</p></p>
