        <strong>Need some links to evidence</strong>
        <p><p>Okay you people are all going off the line. I would like some links that proves pizza is a commonly used code-word among pedophiles. Or that any of those symbols suggested are really used. </p>
<p>Thank you. Just want evidence. I am a skeptic at heart, and while some of the leads in this sub looks promising, most of it seems a step or two away from conclusive. </p></p>

        <p><p>Well I can tell you that from my personal experience using the internet I've seen the words 'Pizza' or 'Cheese Pizza' used when referencing child porn, this is going back almost ten years when I first remember being confused about people talking about 'Cheese Pizza' on 4chan. As for the symbology, I highly suggest that you watch the YouTube video "Podesta's, Pizza and Pedos" to get a base understanding of what is being used and by whom.</p></p>

        <p><p>This seems like a pretty concrete connection. 2 or 3 more and I'd say we can safely check this off as evidence provided. </p></p>

        <p><p>Thank you for the FBI document. I wonder why they suspect these symbols. Is there no more information available besides this single page of an FBI report published out of context?</p></p>

<p>CP = "cheese pizza"</p>
<p>There's no solid evidence because no sane pedo is going to go on the record saying "look pizza is a codeword for child porn".</p></p>

<p>I suspect that not all of the images are staged and could be real evidence. Either way, this type of "art" is perverse about children and resonates with the rest of the investigation. </p></p>

        <p><p>It's just some metal shit. Please pull together something real for me to believe in this pizzagate stuff. It all smells bad, but I don't want your balogna pseudo-proof. I posted this thread to gain a glimpse of any actual EVIDENCE against these people. </p>
<p>So far the FBI documents with matching symbology looks super bad. But without some kind of coroboration that the word 'pizza' is connected in someway to pedophilia all of this falls apart. And I haven't seen any proof of this. WHERE IS A PROFESSIONAL IN THE FIELD DRAWING A CONNECTION BETWEEN PEDO'S AND PIZZA AS  A CODE WORD?</p></p>

        <p><p>It's common Internet slang. there are loads of other circumstantial evidence.   Tony Podesta was "teaching"with Denny Hastert  in Japan.  All these people are acquainted with Jeffrey Epstein.  Alefantis is a documented blackmailer (in simple terms).  There is pedophile imagery "art" in john podestas house.  I can go on and on.  </p>
<p>If after looking at all of this you still don't think it's enough circumstantial evidence to warrant a thorough investigation then you are a shill.   There's definitely enough for further investigation which could lead to enough for a conviction.  Especially once the IRS gets involved in the money starts to get audited.  </p></p>

        <p><p>I am interested in where the information about pedophile art in john podestas house came from. I've seen this mentioned tons of times but never once accredited.  </p>
<p>If all of the information provided to us was accurate it may be enough to warrant an investigation. But I am set on verifying the veracity of said basal claims before launching a crusade. </p></p>

        <p><p>Here read about Tony's creepy art .  Wapo since took this down but its been archived https://archive.fo/tRPmL</p>
<p>Look at the art those people produce.  There's also a photo of the exact art in his home but i am on mobile so not digging it out.  If you are truly concerned you can do the digging it's not hard use google or search the forum.  If you want to be spoon fed stuff that is readily available you are just a troll</p></p>
