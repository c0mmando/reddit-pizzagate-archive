    The Politics of Serial Murder : The Pedophocracy
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I wanted to give some attention to a great researcher on this subject.  Dave McGowan wrote articles about this subject 16 years ago  called the Pedophocracy, which he later expanded &amp; wrote a book on called The Politics of Serial Murder.
   </p>
   <p>
    I see links to some of this information on the bottom of the forum.  I believe credit to due to McGowans research of where allot of this is extracted from, he also has connected dots I have not seen connected yet here.
   </p>
   <p>
    The book expands on his series of research articles The Pedophocracy &amp; There's something about Henry.
   </p>
   <p>
    It provides more evidence for the bigger framework and how we already have allot of information of these networks existing, but the glue is missing.  He found many parallels to serial killer phenomena and operation Phoenix in the military, and was an excellent writer as well as researcher.

    Years ago after 9/11 when I redpilled, I saw getting this information out to the unwanting public like starting a fire in a wet forest with damp matches. Still I tried, and so did many others as well.  I think now the forest is bone dry.

    As Douglas Valentine writes in The Phoenix Program (Morrow, 1990)- concerning the CIA's assassination, torture and terror program waged against the people of Vietnam - the Phoenix teams consisted of SEALs working with "CTs," described by one participant as "a combination of ARVN deserters, VC turncoats, and bad motherfucker criminals the South Vietnamese couldn't deal with in prison, so they turned them over to us." The spooks were only too happy to employ the services of these men, who "taught [their] SEAL comrades the secrets of the psy war campaign." So depraved were these agency recruits that some of them "would actually devour their enemies' vital organs." All in a day's work for America's premier intelligence agency.

    "Satanists are peculiar people. They aren’t ignorant peasants or semiliterate natives. Rather, their ranks are filled with doctors, lawyers, businessmen, and basically highly responsible citizens... They are not a careless group who are apt to make mistakes. But they are secretive and bonded together by a common need and desire to mete out havoc on society. It was Aleister Crowley who said: “I want blasphemy, murder, rape, revolution, anything bad.”
