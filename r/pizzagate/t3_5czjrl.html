        <strong>Washington Post 1989 regarding Johnny Gosch and Paul Bonacci (Franklin Case)</strong>
        <p><p>IMO some of the hardest most concrete evidence for this going on in govt. Maybe we can sift through and try to find any connections?

        <p><p>Folks, the Washington Post did everything in its power to squelch the Franklin Scandal investigation.  It's well known that when the Washington Times paper came out w/the front page article, the Post started a series of articles denouncing the Times and its reporting (as also did the LA Times and NY Times).</p>
<p>If you read a book titled 'confessions of a dc madam', you will read how the Post not only helped kill the investigation into the Franklin Scandal, but they also besmirched one of the unwilling participants in that CIA blackmail ring.  The 'madam's name is Vinson (also the co-author of the book), and if you read his story, you just shake your head and wonder how the Post manages to stay in business, and not be in jail for their crimes.</p>
<p>Anyone who buys a Washington Post newspaper or goes to their site is abetting a known participant in the child trafficking/blackmail rings.  They may not be actively involved in the trafficking, but they are damn well involved in covering up the aftermath...</p>
<p>How anyone works at that paper and can look in the mirror at night is beyond me.  A bunch of sick f's.</p></p>
