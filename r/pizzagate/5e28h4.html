    Thoughts about Haiti and Trafficking
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    If there is a vast conspiracy to move children out of Haiti and (presumably) to the United States, we would do well to familiarize ourselves with how that would actually happen, and if there is any research on the physical transportation involved.
   </p>
   <p>
    Say children in Haiti are being kidnapped by proxy of the mining complex Monica Peterson mentioned. Or maybe they're being taken from orphanages, or off of the street. Where do they go next? How are they transported in Haiti? By car, I would assume, but who knows?
   </p>
   <p>
    Next, how do they get to the US? By Boat? or by Plane? If they were going by boat, where would their US destination be? Same for air travel. That connection between Haiti and the US is the point at which most of the trafficking, if it exists, must take place. Before that and after that any trafficked children are moving to divergent locations. I'm sorry that I don't have any time to really dig into this myself, but I think some of you ought to consider this.

    From the new deleted emails: Clinton foundation launched a program to ship moringa from haiti to the US.  Podesta authorized to make all decisions for the foundation concerning their investments in Haiti.  Autistic adults do most of the work on the fulfillment and shipping side.  Maybe Podesta could use this shipping route to ship kids into the US?

     can you post email ids? That sounds like a good thing to investigate

      from the zip folder on the dropbox, the one with filename 59006.html has the information about moringa and the one with filename 58186.html has the information about Podesta taking "Bruce's" place on Haiti investment decisions (tells Laura to let Jean-Marc know, Jean-Marc might be Jean-Marc Villain who is associated with the HDF).  I don't really know how to bring them up on the wikileaks site since they are hidden emails.

    Wouldn't it make sense to traffic by boat to the nearest port being in Florida/Eastern seaboard? With the donations the Seafarers Union donated to them it might be a matter of get our cargo through and we'll look after your pay and conditions.

     This is why I posted this here. I knew someone would have some deeper insight. I don't know how you find information about shipping, or if there would be any way to get info on what was being shipped, or if it would even be possible to tell if children were being shipped on particular trips or whatever else. I imagine that the shipping companies might have some idea that they were sending something illegal, but they probably would not know what was really being sent.

      I tried to look up shipping manifests of one particular company but it takes a lot of work.
