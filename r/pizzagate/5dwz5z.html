    I used to believe in Snopes but I found out they are no different from media, look into the background of who funds snopes and you'll find out...

      Yeah, Snopes makes its own evidence....
     </p>
     <p>
      Honestly I first questioned Snopes' legitimacy when it started making yes/no conclusions under incomplete evidence, regarding everything related to the Clinton Foundation/Democrats/History/etc.
     </p>
     <p>
      I used to love Snopes btw. Used it to confirm everything as a high school kid, like that crazy frog-looking guy's meme and stuff.

    I understand the_donald is a controversial sub, but they provided a good layout of information for the initial spirit cooking that helped kick-start the whole investigation: here's the link.

     From what I looked up marina abromovic is a performer. Playing devil's advocate, who's to say this isn't just her inviting him to an act of a performance and maybe teaching him about it?

      That same post answers it, read her AMA she did 3 years ago in which she explains that public vs private performances are very different.  Remember the invite was to her own private residence.

     <p>
      The spirit cooking dinner to which Marina invited the Podesta brothers (evidenced in the Podesta Wikileaks, https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15893) was at her private home.

      When you did your research, did it also show you that her twitter handle had 666 in it, that she cut pentagrams into herself, and used satanic imagery? Did you look up what "spirit cooking" is?

      She has a very strange obsession with pentagrams (which are typically associated with satan), her twitter handle literally has 666 at the end, she has some extremely creepy pictures taken with children such as:

     <p>
      this:https://i.sli.mg/9zF2ZE.jpg
     </p>
     <p>
      And this: https://i.sli.mg/3eoKMj.jpg
     </p>
     <p>
      Btw, watch her spirit cooking video, that's not normal art, whatsoever.

      devil is in the details. She is a performer. She is a satanist. Spirit cooking is a direct reference to Aleister Crowley's Book of Thelma. Sure a catholic could be engaging in a mock satanic ritual for fun (though that seems unlikely) but Marina has specified that private performances are "real" unlike her public ones.
     </p>
     <p>
      I am really surprised that the art doesn't speak for itself. There is satanic reference in almost every single one. It would be like an artist that includes references to jesus, mary, and puts a cross and a lamb in every painting but peolpe insist it is just art, not related to or referencing Christianity at all. Worse it is like some of Tony Podesta's favorite artists, depicting children suggestively/nude, saying their art is to showcase sexuality of children, then insisting it isn't child porn or related to or referencing child porn at all.
     </p>
     <p>
      I am an artist. I believe in freedom of expression. Besides the kid stuff all the satanic art is their prerogative. But let's not use art for the all inclusive cover- call a spade a spade.

       Some account, don't remember which one, was scrubbed to remove a reference to her being Jewish when she hit the news for her 'art' work. I remember seeing it being reported.

    marina abromovic invited them by email to a spirit cooking dinner. It was leaked out but dont know if they went. lady Gaga did though. Plenty of photos on Google of her there and other people you could look through some on google of the event and see if you can spot them. John has a painting that hangs in his office of two men eating another but make what you want of it. Is an odd painting though. http://www.truefreethinker.com/articles/hell%E2%80%99s-kitchen-spirit-cooking-john-podesta-marina-abramovic
