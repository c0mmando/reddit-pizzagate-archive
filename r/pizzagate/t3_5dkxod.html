        <p><p>Note: the "speaker of the house" likely refers to Dennis Hastert, a convicted serial child molester who is friends with Tony Podesta. </p>
<p>They seem to be joking and thereby acknowledging that child molestation is indeed occurring at the farm. </p>

        <p><p>Judging by the Oct 2015 date, this is a joke referencing the media circus that was kicked off by John Boehner's resignation as Speaker and the power struggle that followed with all sorts of Republicans trying to see if they could grab the job.  At the time, even reporters would jokingly "announce" they were running for Speaker just to show how silly it had gotten.</p></p>
