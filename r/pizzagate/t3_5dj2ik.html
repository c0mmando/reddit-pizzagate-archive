        <strong>An idea of interest. [Off topic]</strong>
        <p><p>This article is the first step in my thinking.</p>
<p>http://www.saveservices.org/2013/12/child-abduction-often-begins-in-domestic-violence-shelters/</p>
<p>It basically describes how domestic violence "Victims" can move in an illegal underground railroad with their children to avoid legal proceedings.  The problem I see with this system is the level of abuse that could take place.  These people will disappear off the grid and are in the hands of others.  Many leave their identity behind.  </p>
<p>What would stop one of the people moving the "Victim" from kidnapping them mid move?</p></p>
