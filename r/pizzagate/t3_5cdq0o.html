<p><blockquote>

<p>A few days ago I discovered that they might well be performing masonic rituals. The artist whose paintings are displayed in Comet Ping Pong has a lot of paintings depicting orgies and the Ouroboros, which is the snake in the seal of Solomon.  https://www.instagram.com/arringtondedionyso/ </p>
<p>The Solomon Wikipedia page mentions masonic rituals in freemasonry: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon#Freemasonry </p>

<p>Which links to another Wikipedia page about masonic rituals: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masonic_ritual_and_symbolism</p></p>

<p><p>Ok that instragram feed is weird as fuck.</p>
<p>So many artists keep popping up with all these grotesque porno paintings (podesta collection, comet pizza gallery, etc) and most of his paintings show tonnnnnnnsss of masonic imagery bullshit.</p>

<p><p>Honestly, I think we should be archiving this guys Instagram, too. It's yet another piece of the puzzle. Ever since the spirit cooking and Comet Pizza stories broke I've been wondering the same. At the very least we must admit that the things we've seen in our investigations perfectly resonate with what David Icke has been trying to tell us for years. If you had told me I'd be saying this a few weeks ago I would've laughed in your face. I only remembered Icke when these stories broke and have since watched or partially watched: </p>
<p>Satanists &amp; Pedophiles Run The World - David Icke: https://youtu.be/IgP88z6h-Zk </p>
<p>Why Hundreds of Thousands Of Children Go Missing Every Year - David Icke: https://youtu.be/c3ibpk9rkEc</p>
<p>And I just saw he also has a video on spirit cooking! Haven't seen it yet. https://youtu.be/55W8Qy31ujE</p>
<p>I dismissed him as a crazy conspiracy theorist before, the last time I ever listened to him must've been at least a decade ago and I had totally forgotten about him. I'm trying to keep an open mind on this and when I listen to him now I have to at least admit he's very intelligent and does a lot of research. What we've learned so far is that a lot of people involved have been hiding in plain sight.  Without the information we have now, we would've never paid attention to any of it or connected the dots. It might be better not to go too far down the rabbit hole on this stuff, it's probably not healthy and my partner has already complained he's worried. Haha. But seeking for the truth and trying to understand the world around us is just so tempting. </p>
<p>What if the truth is out there and we're simply not ready to accept it? It's so hard to process all this information, but at the same time, if the writing is on the wall, how can we rationally say it's all just coincidence and simply a conspiracy anymore... Especially now that children are involved. Now that we have all this information, I don't think it would be morally correct to ignore the victims any longer because their stories don't fit into our word views. They even have programs to tell the victims they're simply suffering from delusions. </p></p>

<p><p>Im an in complete agreement about Icke. Ive been a researcher since my teens, and i have worked very diligently to maintain an objective and open mind. </p>
<p>His stuff always seemed too far fetched, and my initial impression was that he was just trying to sell books and lecture tickets.</p>
<p>However, even at my most objective, this stuff keeps fitting together like puzzle pieces with all the symbols hidden in plain sight. I keep comparing it to Blade, where the vampires used symbols to mark their hideouts, clubs, blood banks etc.</p>
<p>Its all starting to seem less like the imagination of good writers, and more like people in the know are/were trying to send a message.</p></p>

<p><p>We're on the same page. I'm kind of worried about how this will all pan out since there's no way they will go down without a fight. On one hand, the authorities can continue to cover for them, which may indeed be safer for the general population (except the poor victims) but on the other hand, more and more people will realise and be made aware of what's actually going on. It's been set in motion now. They won't be able to write certain things off as mere conspiracy theories any longer, even spirit cooking and the fact that George Soros is the "no borders, no nations" puppet master is starting to become mainstream knowledge now. All these revelations make me think back to other conspiracy theories that I didn't take seriously in the past. Denver airport, FEMA concentration camps. Tumultuous times. </p></p>

<p><p>I never really understoof the outrage over him selling tickets/books ....the guy has to make a living as well. Who would employ him after he went on a speaking tour about this stuff? It is sort of up to us to help him out now that the truth has been brought to light.</p></p>

<p><p>He likely isn't even aware of the discoveries we've made over the past days. We need to somehow send him a summary of our findings. I'm certain he'd be interested and might even spread the information. Considering he has a much bigger reach than us, it's really something we should strive to do. </p></p>

<p><p>PS: Speaking of snake fucking (never would've imagined myself ever saying that a week ago...), read the following, it was posted on pizzagate yesterday: http://pastebin.com/79YZVjYz</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Louf, and other witnesses, recounted being raped by dogs and snakes...</p>
<p>These kids also described wild satanic rituals they were forced to participate in, ..... with some claims as bizarre as a babies head being chopped off, and being forced to drink the blood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The latter excerpt reminded me of this painting, same artist again: https://www.instagram.com/p/BIEkKR2hFVx/?taken-by=arringtondedionyso</p></p>

<p><p>Exactly. I believe looking into the art they admire is not something we should ignore. They obviously wouldn't straight up publicly display and admire photos of themselves doing whatever it is they do. Art is very expressive, a reminder of what you love and can identify with and shouldn't be brushed off as meaningless nonsense. I'd hang up a van Gogh painting for example, because I love impressionism, beautiful landscapes and architecture. </p>
<p>Podesta on the other hand hangs up a massive golden sculpture of a headless man which looks exactly like a Jeffrey Dahmer victim in his house: https://dcpizzagate.wordpress.com/ scroll down the page to see it. He also has this painting in his office: http://thetruthdivision.com/2016/11/busted-podestas-spirit-cooking-exposed-but-now-look-what-we-found-in-his-office/ </p>
<p>Check out the music videos in another thread I made when this stuff first came to light: https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bjr63/occultism_in_the_ping_pong_room_of_john_podestas/</p>
<p>Art is telling. These people enjoy art as much as any other art lover would. We should save and spread the artwork they admire. </p></p>

<p><p>Alice in Wonderland? Haha, that's peculiar... After the European "refugee crisis" started, I began openly comparing people (progressives, SJW's, people who believe anything the MSM and Soros tell them) to being brainwashed and lost in Wonderland. Source? :) </p></p>

<p><p>Your point is valid. Please don't misunderstand me; i never had any outrage, or gave it a second thought.  I just figured it was a, "i have something amazing to tell you, but first i'll need your credit card number," situation.</p>
<p>I'm embarrassed for breaking my own rule of never dismissing a claim because it sounds too far fetched. Never again.</p></p>
