    Does anyone find it suspect that the children say the exact same thing several times? Like maybe it's rehearsed?

     I've watched all 4 hours of their videos. Most of the time is spent talking to the police behind closed doors, one on one, and it does come out that the mom's boyfriend got them to get their stories straight by rehearsing, but there were medical examinations done that showed scarring of their genitals, and really, all anyone would have to do is go and check to see if their headmistress really does have tattoos where the kids say they do.
    </p>
    <p>
     They also later recanted, the kids did, after spending a week with their father, and it looks like he's going to win primary custody.
    </p>
    <p>
     All in all, a very weird case, but the evidence stacks up a bit more on the side of it all being true. ish.
    </p>
    <p>
     Also, the UK has banned viewing this video, so if you like to see patterns, there's that. Nothing incontrovertible, but we are the people. We are not blind. The PTB would have you believe that justice, and the people, are the same thing, but they're not. Mary, Queen of Scots, had the support of her cabinet, and by extension the justice department of her gov, but the people saw to it that justice would be served. We need to keep in mind that the power to govern comes from the consent of the masses, which is a nice way of saying that we give them permission to hold power. We can also take it away.

      So it's an accusation of child abuse
      <em>
       in the midst of a custody battle
      </em>
      ? And the male voice is Mom's new boyfriend telling them what to say to get Dad locked up so he and Mom can get custody? Yeah, I am now 100% there is nothing to this, and it's not directly related to the investigation of this sub anyway.

       I would agree, except for the fact that both children had scarring around their anuses.

          It should be on the Hoaxtead site. There was so much information to go through to be honest. I'll have a look.

     It definitely seems like the people asking them have prompted them entirely. I want to believe, but this feels very rehearsed and difficult to believe.

     I thought the fact they said the same thing at same time showed that they experienced these things together, many times giving them a detailed memory of the events. I don't know how they could memorize so much and perfectly recite 'lines' at that age and be so convincing.

      Maybe, maybe not. Kids that age act in plays and things of that sort.

      I was Antipholus of Syracuse in Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors in 4th grade. Kids act in plays and memorize lines all the time.
     </p>
     <p>
      I don't find these kids convincing at all. Sexual abuse is highly traumatic, and so is witnessing the murder of an infant, but these kids are saying it the same way they might describe any normal event in their lives. The Dad or whoever clearly knows the answers to these questions already and is asking pointed questions to get specific answers, pressing and asking again when they don't answer to his satisfaction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Seems to me like a video of kids being coached (poorly) to make this stuff up. Regardless, this video is nothing but a distraction from the actual investigation.

       There is an audio recording which proves the coaching, when the boyfriend is asking the kids to keep saying phrases such as "kill the babies" Its when his brother in law was present, a policeman. "The Jean clement recording"

    I know they later recanted, but the girl mentions that the head teacher has a tattoo or birthmark "on her privates" so that could easily be confirmed.... anyone know if that was followed up on?

     no, nothing was folowed up on it.The police did a drive tho the areas/houses the kids mentioned,thye couldnt recognize anything but none of the accused were interviewed or "bits checked."
The police (ABE) interview that got leaked of the children was very bizarre also, ans seems to be leading them......
It was all very suspicious from the start this rabbit hole. Yes thousands belived the childrens testimony, including me, the parents were flakes, the step dad,Abe, epecially, full of shit and IMO very capable of coaching these two children to say this stuff, though god knows why u would concoct suchan a amzing story to get back at thier real dad, Dearman, who also is dodgy as fuck. I researvched a lot aout this when it broke, and I still have no idea if the cult/abuse was real. Heres a muddy rabbit hole, you have been warned lol.....only 1031 pages of abuse, shill calling

       They found scarring inside of both children, and on the outside of the little boy.

     They never did. They got to kids to recant, even after a doctor found scarring on both the kids' genitals, and the cops quickly turned away from the places they aren't supposed to look, just like the good boys they are.

     It wasn't followed up because the case fell apart for several reasons. The kids couldn't identify any of the places they originally said they'd been abused, even though the mother's boyfriend had taken them out for a drive round the night before to try and coach them (police weren't too thrilled about that). The one house the little boy said was his dad's turned out to have been empty for weeks, and as police could see directly into it, they could tell it had none of the features described (secret staircase, hidden rooms, etc.). Then the police searched the church and found that nothing matched the descriptions. They went to the church without warning, were given full access, and searched thoroughly. Nada. 
Shortly afterward, the children were taken into protective custody as they said the boyfriend had been abusing them physically and the mother had done nothing to stop it. Once they were safe in custody, they volunteered the info that they had made it all up on the stepfather and mother's urging. They said this in the car, and the police asked them to wait until they were in the interview room; once there, they told the truth and said they hated the boyfriend and never wanted to see him again. Once the allegations were retracted, there was no case, and hence it would have been illegal to continue interviewing witnesses, let alone asking them to drop their pants for an inspection. https://hoaxteadresearch.wordpress.com/hampstead-hoax-faq/frequently-asked-questions-the-police-investigation/

     I'm not from the UK but wasn't that due to a privacy issue regarding minors and showing their face?  Were the blurred versions i have seen considered banned as well?

      I don't know if the blurred versions are banned as well but I'm highly suspicious of the UK government requesting YT to block my upload considering the allegations of influential government officials being involved in pedo rings.

       I just chalked it up to the big privacy laws they have over there, maybe someone from the UK can clarify on if it is actually out of the ordinary?  I know nothing of their usual standards and practices, I just see odd things come out of there like the lifetime gag order on James bulgers' killers

       Our mission is to engage kids with good food. And it all started in the late 90s with one inquisitive teacher. She rang up her local PizzaExpress and asked if her class could cook with us for the day. Thanks to her bright request, we’ve turned our classrooms into kitchens over 23,000 times.

    The things they say and the way they say them are way too organic to be made up. Look how stressed out these kids look too. I'd believe that there is something to it.

     The people that say that this was all a product of coaching must not have noticed the look on the little girl's face when the brother said that she also helped with the baby killing. When she said "do not say my name". I still think of that face as the archetype of guilty fear, not in a bad way, because she has nothing to feel guilty about, but just that it's the most pure expression of that particular combination of emotions that I have ever seen.

    They seemed detached from the things they're saying, and not a traumatic detached. It doesn't seem like they actually went through these experiences. They seem way too excited to tell these stories. I killed babies! They did sex to us hundreds of times a day!

     I'd read the medical reports that /u/bassdrumofdeath666 posted. The medical examiner confirms evidence of injuries that support their allegations.

    Quote:
Children coerced to make “satanic cult” allegations through psychological and physical abuse
A judge has detailed the horrific physical and psychological abuse of two young children, at the hands of their mother and her partner in the Hampstead area of North London.
Abraham Christie with the support of Ms. Ella Draper “tortured” Draper’s 9 year old daughter and 8 year old son, over a period of several months last year. They were punched and kicked, shoved in to walls, drenched with cups of water, and hit in the head and other parts of the body with metal spoons. The presence of THC in the children’s hair might also indicate the content of their regular “hemp” drinks, may actually have been the juiced form of active cannabis.
