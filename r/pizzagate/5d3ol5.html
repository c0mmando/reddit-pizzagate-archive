    Thoughts on how to break this case
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    A) Follow the money - all of this, ultimately, is about money.   FBIAnon has indicated that the Clinton Foundation has been selling people - but also state secrets, arms, etc.
   </p>
   <p>
    B) Avoid the word "satanic".  There is likely an occult element to this  - especially with the art.  But there are plenty of new agers who are into occult practices who are normal people.  Lets not tar and feather everyone into alternative spirituality.  Focus on the crimes - the rituals are not, in and of themselves, illegal or even immoral.
   </p>
   <p>
    C) Don't give up.  The message is breaking through, just spread the word to everyone.  The problem with these issues is that people don't want to hear about it - its disturbing.  But we need to get mass attention on this to get it solved.  So you need strike a delicate balance between pushing and waiting for people to open up to hearing about all this.  There are innocent kids relying on us to get this right - right away.
   </p>
   <p>
    D) The Clintons are obviously involved - but the mere mention of that makes it "political".  It may be better to focus the investigation on the Podesta brothers and the Pizzeria owners.  if we go down that path, when everything comes out, the clintons will be implicated.
   </p>
   <p>
    E) Assemble communications to people new to this as bite sized chunks that layer, e.g. "Did you know that there is a pizzeria in DC whose owner posts all these gross pics on instragram - i gotta show you....Yeah, and there is evidence that this guy is a huge pedophile....He's closely associated with Podesta...Podesta makes strange references to pizza in his email...researchers are suggesting the food words are code...this code has been used by other bad people in the past, etc".  Do NOT bombard someone new to this with pastebin links and or send them directly here - they will disengage.

    Well said, good advice.  I have eased a few of my friends in to it who were huge Hillary supporters with (E).  Needless to say they are off the Hillary Train.  This is not a political issue.  This is a good vs evil issue.  This is not a religious issue.  This is a good vs evil issue.  I hope we can keep this sub open, but it is looking bad.

    I'd like to add
   </p>
   <p>
    F) Keep haunting the authorities that you know about these things and you demand thorough and truthful investigations.  Talk to any law enforcement you know irl to get insight on what to do.
   </p>
   <p>
    G) Share with Active and retired military so they can see the kind of people they are taking orders from
   </p>
   <p>
    Also, for E) http://sli.mg/YfT0i1 is a great starting point. Some other fellow just posted it

    Exactly. We have to stay calm and rational, present this all as FACTS and not just another "conspiracy theory". This is serious shit, but people don't take it serious when you start throwing around words like "satanic occult rituals" or straight up implicating someone like either the clintons or trump, people then think it's all some political smear job by a bunch of bitter internet weirdos.
   </p>
   <p>
    We have to start getting organized with whatever we are going to present as the main narrative, and not get distracted by following this spiderweb as deep as possible. We have to show what we KNOW for certain, the obvious bits of evidence ( Logo change, Alefantis, The constant references and codes in the emails/ those involved) and then people will naturally be able to start making the deeper connections from there. But to get everyone on board, all the other "normal" people, we have to prove that this isn't just some paranoid fairy tale but a serious matter we all must help in. 
Ignorance is our greatest enemy here. People either will have no way of learning about this OR will refuse to simply on the basis that it challenges everything that they know. They don't know how cruel the world truly is, and how very real this all most likely is.

     One way to prep/prime them for this info is by getting them to watch the acclaimed documentary, "Who Stole Johnny", which is available on netflix.

    This right here:
E) Assemble communications to people new to this as bite sized chunks that layer, e.g. "Did you know that there is a pizzeria in DC whose owner posts all these gross pics on instragram - i gotta show you....Yeah, and there is evidence that this guy is a huge pedophile....He's closely associated with Podesta...Podesta makes strange references to pizza in his email...researchers are suggesting the food words are code...this code has been used by other bad people in the past, etc".

    They have had way too much time to cover shit up. For example besta's changing their logo confirms they know about it. They sure as hell won't be doing any pizza parties near that street anymore.

     Yeah, but the thing about these guys is they think they can get away with everything.  That will trip them up.  They will repeat mistakes and they will not hide for long.  But to your point, this is why we need to follow the money.  The money is how this case will crack open - all of the rest is just clues pointing us towards the right people/institutions to investigate.

    All very good advice and I agree wholeheartedly.
   </p>
   <p>
    I usually approach friends that I'm telling about this with the Besta Pizza bit. I show them the logo and how its a FBI-confirmed pedo logo and how it was changed just days after that was discovered and spread around the internet. Then I talk about how two doors down there is a guy with all sorts of connections in government who owns a ping pong place and his instagram is filled with creepy pedo-esque pictures. Then I talk about how he definitely knows and is close with Podesta. Then I talk about Podesta's emails. Then if I haven't scared them off, I bring up pizza.jpg. That's where most people start to really freak out.

    Also, archive everything and if you post evidence, post how you obtained that evidence. Everyone should be able to repeat the process and get the same evidence. This is what keeps us a "real" investigation.

    Breaking Spirit Cooking into the public first was a good call and primed people for whatever disgusting revelations will come next. Always push the gross out stuff first. Then reveal the crime.

    Is there any way the possible connecting tunnels could be confirmed? Tech that can 'see' underground imaging exists, are there companies that provide subterranean imaging that could be used for this?
