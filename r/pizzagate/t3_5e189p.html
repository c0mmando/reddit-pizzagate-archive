<strong>What kind of evidence do you guys need from us?</strong>
<p><p>Okay, let me clear up some misconceptions (we still are forced to use tactical misinformation to cover our assess (limited to time, date, etc, <strong>BUT NEVER VALIDITY OF INFORMATION</strong>, I am sorry we are forced to for our own protection).</p>
<p>Here is what we have (admittedly stolen so far):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>2GB of Pedo videos and photos (which I posted as proof for those who doubted me, but since child rape photos are illegal, I can't keep posting the proof). Reddit has since deleted the rape photos, but, I could post a video of a girl being anally raped in a metal cage if you guys want more fucking proof. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps 1 or more fully cloned Hard drive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encrypted list of monthly clients generated using a bizarre .exe program:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e0i3m/here_is_the_encrypted_client_list_for_we_the/</p>
<p>He says this file was found on the Desktop of a computer running Windows XP, I have also run the .exe sandboxed, and although it does try to phone home I have not been able to reproduce the PGP message or the London IP call. We are working on getting the private key.</p>
<p>/u/wethepizza_the2ndGuy <strong>IS</strong> working with me. He is working on trying to decrypt the message.</p>
<p>But I (we) really want to know is, what proof do you guys need for this to be verified? I already posted the child rape as proof, "We are Pizza" took their site down 2 hours after I went public, so I ask again what more proof do you need or want?</p>
<p>Torrenting via TOR is advised against, so uploading the cloned Hard drive is more difficult then it sounds. But we are going to do whatever it takes to prove our case.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>
<p>We used social engineering (with the help of our 3 letter friend to go in under cover as a computer repair tech). That's how he got the 2GB pedo photos/videos and unconfirmed Windows XP cloned hard drive. And he just walked out with the data dump. We don't even know where each other currently is at.</p>
<p>What a lot of people don't understand is that .PDF's can "phone home", we are currently trying to remove the "phone home" feature before posting Price List.pdf file.</p></p>

<p><p><em>sigh</em>.. guys, this is fake. It should have been obvious from the start when he put up a tinyupload link to actual CP. This is a hoax created with the purpose of logging your information. OP hasn't responded to anything and he won't respond to anything because the damage has been done. He got you. They won. If you clicked on those links, I'd go throw your computer in a river or some shit.</p>
<p>Don't fall for this again. No one is going to come in here and say "hey I found a pizza place that had a secret link to CP, here's a download link for 2GB of it!" with the actual purpose of helping the investigation. No one with a functioning brain would do that.</p></p>

<p><p>Because Spike Mendelsohn isn't important at all. His ties to Andrew Kline aren't important. Regardless of this leak being real or not, this is a huge lead/break. This is not the direction a troll would lead us. Spike had pics of Obama and Saudis on his instagram.. you're saying we were misdirected to think someone is a peso hanging out with Obama &amp; Saudi Arabia?? That doesn't happen. </p></p>

<p><p>Did I ever at any point in my comment say that this Spike dude was unimportant? <em>Nope</em>. I just don't want anyone here going to prison and I'd like people to stop falling for this kind of stuff. Never mentioned Spike. Didn't need to.</p></p>

<p><p>Seriously, this sub just imploed. I'm seeing a disgusting number of links to CP popping up in posts, reporting every single one. I'm in disbelief that members of this sub would be so fucking dumb to directly link to the content we're fighting so hard against. Fuck these disgusting sacks of shit spreading these images, you should be ashamed of yourselves and hopefully will be having a talk with local authorities soon.</p></p>

<p>NAOW! </p>
<p>Seriously, put it all up now. DUMP DUMP DUMP and we can verify it as we go along. Especially get that client list program out and the HD! </p>
<p>Post ALL the faces/bodies of adults on reddit. We can analyze. Put the CP somewhere safe. Don't dump it on Reddit.</p>
<p>edit: Also, I'd recommend leaking out to as many local lawmen, sheriffs, and news agencies as you can.  </p></p>

<p><p>I should note: </p>
<p>Worked extensively with security personnel (mainly analysts with regional sheriff's and 3-Letter) selling software that enabled surveillance. Most of those guys/gals are some of the smartest, most capable people around.</p>
<p>They have hard jobs and experience dealing with CP cases and such, so if OP actually has info, they should submit it to as many people as possible. </p></p>

<p><p>The mods are advising to contact authorities and lawyering up but if they swoop on the lawyers that you guys hire (who probably won't give a shit about your cause) could easily turn on against you guys and you'd be swatted down and smothered without a squeak. As soon as you have something solid, for example, make some breakthroughs with the client list, spread it like a wildfire on the internet so it can never die. Once it leaks out, it's impossible to contain and even though a lot of people are suspecting the validity and legitimacy of the post. However the fact that this is getting so much attention and pressure with all these fishy shutdown attempts going  on should tell us that we are pretty fucking close to unveiling these abominable beasts. </p></p>

<p><p>2GB of Pedo videos and photos (which I posted as proof for those who doubted me, but since child rape photos are illegal, I can't keep posting the proof). Reddit has since deleted the rape photos, but, I could post a video of a girl being anally raped in a metal cage if you guys want more fucking proof. </p>

<p>No it's not. </p>
<p>Upload, or disappear. If you were competent enough to get the data, you're competent enough to upload. If you don't upload, it didn't happen. We're not paying any more attention to you until you actually do something.</p></p>

<p><p>Start with screenshots of folder contents.  Include date created and any other pertinent file information.  As was said elsewhere, post the raw HTML.  </p>
<p>If you have the stomach for it, try and find faces.  Make sure to not include ANY CP.  These can be cross referenced against existing images and missing persons lists.</p></p>

<p><p>At the very least, try something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Screenshot as much tangentially related stuff as you can, even if it's not smoking gun status proof.  Pictures of things like the directory structures, or the pages of documents (if you can even open them).</li>
<li>Gather any raw source code from the site if it's among the data you collected</li>
<li>Gather any kind of evidence that you at least had contact with WeThePizza. If you called them at any point, take a screenshot of your phone log, or of your mobile provider's online statement page (with details blacked out of course).</li>
<li>Archive all that along with whatever else you can</li>
<li>Get an encrypted email account with something like <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a></li>
<li>PM the mods, and have them also get an encrypted email that you can safely send messages to (making sure they're using <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">tor</a>, a <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/vpn-anonymous-review-160220/">non-logging vpn</a>, some kind of public/cellular internet connection, and ideally running their pc's off a <a href="https://www.kali.org/">live cd/usb</a> so that nothing touches their hard drives).</li>
<li>Have <strong>them</strong> verify your 'proof' and report back to the rest of us.</li>

<p><p>welp, finally got me out of lurking. I will say in advance that IF -- and that is a very big if given your behavior so far -- I'm wrong I will gladly and fully apologize.</p>
<p>This reeks of utter bullshit.  I don't care if you're uncomfortable with TOR or unfamiliar with 4, 8, etc chan. Judging by your formatting in every post so far you are at least familiar with reddit formatting. ergo, you have time to type this up neatly for all of us. ergo, this does not come across as someone in fear for their life willing to dump everything to get the information out soon before something sacrificially bad happens to them. No, this comes across as something as an ARG and I'm now waiting for the product placement announcement.</p>
<p>I know there's a mix of bad blood and lovehate between reddit and the various chans, but the one thing we can agree on is that we do NOT fuck around or about with CP. I'm personally going back to focus on actual ongoing concrete information. If you're serious, thanks for the heads up and next time ask mods of any similar subs for help because this was embarrassingly incompetent.</p>
<p>but if this was you grabbing your 15 minutes of fame, congratulations. You got it plus several hours. Please do not ever come back or waste our time again with this fucking bullshit.</p></p>

<p><p>The other guy got the data dump, and no he didn't film himself doing, WTF would he do that????</p>
<p>We used social engineering (with the help of our 3 letter friend to go in under cover as a computer repair tech). That's how he got the 2GB pedo photos/videos and unconfirmed Windows XP cloned hard drive. And he just walked out with the data dump. We don't even know where each other currently is at.</p>
<p>What a lot of people don't understand is that .PDF's can "phone home", we are currently trying to remove the "phone home" feature before posting Price List.pdf file. </p></p>

<p>Being banned from this sub is nowhere near as bad as the shit that will happen to him from 4ch and 8ch, when they legit doxx this guy and report him to the FBI for posting that bullshit.. Wow.</p>

<p><p>List of things we need you to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload</li>
</ul>
<p>List of things we don't need you to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sniff the network</li>
<li>Decrypt the key</li>
<li>Strip the PDF of malicious code</li>
<li>Write an algorithm </li>
<li>Hack NASA</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a crowd-sourced investigation for a reason: there are people who will do the things you can't do.</p>
<p>If you're for real, the amount of stalling your doing is absolutely retarded. Basically, it's like if you had the cure for Cancer, and you didn't release it because first you had to bust Big Pharma, or give it a pretty font.</p>
<p>Recap:</p>
<p>Upload, or go away.</p></p>

<p><p>what you don't seem to understand is that we don't care what the pdf does. alot of us know how to handle these things. just post the stuff so we can all work on it. otherwise just post the text from the pdf on pastebin, i mean how hard is that?</p></p>

<p><p>So let me understand your situation.  You, and another "hacker" along with a friendly alphabet, have colluded to infiltrate WtP and clone a computer.  You don't know where your hacker friend is, and alphabet won't help?  So what do you do?  Go to /r/pizzagate and spill your lid about everything, while dumping CP.  Is that about right?  Why not ask alphabet what to do? <br/>
As far as I'm concerned, this is a honeypot until proven otherwise.  Anyone clicking links that are unfamiliar need to wipe their computer with a cloth, ASAP.</p></p>

<p><p>I'd say send it out to every news organization, 3-letter organization, local PD, and definitely send it to Breitbart and Infowars. Considering Bannon will be in Trumps admin, he could potentially hold the information and sit on it until then and then he's in a position of great power where it could actually be put to use. Infowars, we know Alex Jones is an amazing mouthpiece and would absolutely spread it like wildfire to the public. 
PD and 3-letters might act on it, might not. Worth putting it out there at least so in the future it can be called back to/they can't refute knowledge of the videos/pics/etc.
Mainstream, you might get lucky and someone dissatisfied with their job puts it on the teleprompter to read or runs it at the bottom of the screen. </p></p>

<p><p><em>UPDATE</em></p>
<p><em>The level of incompetence in this "hack" is extremely concerning. I am not sure what OP was trying to accomplish, but without the private key this is useless.</em></p>
<p><em>Please provide all of the data/files/html as evidence to MULTIPLE PDs (local or otherwise including the NYPD) before posting on the internet. You need to protect yourself, and establish a chain of evidence. Contacting an attorney is also very critical. If you do not have an attorney, get one asap.</em></p>
<p><em>If you do provide "evidence" on the web do it in an encrypted dump in bittorrent, all users should be careful and protect themselves, this could be a honeypot.</em></p>
<p><em>No one cry wolf without validating OP's "evidence". Bringing false leads to the authorities is a surefire way to lose all credibility for this sub.</em></p>
<p><em>edit: Other users have pointed out, with good reason that local PD alone may be complicit and may not be the course of action. Simply linking on the internet is not how you bust these people though. You need to get as many eyes on the evidence as possible and make sure they understand you want to establish a chain of evidence and that your life is in danger.</em></p>
<p><em>edit2: added request for encrypted bittorrent dump, and piece about false reporting to authorities</em></p>

<p>We used social engineering (with the help of our 3 letter friend to go in under cover as a computer repair tech). That's how he got the 2GB pedo photos/videos and unconfirmed Windows XP cloned hard drive. And he just walked out with the data dump. We don't even know where each other currently is at.</p>

<p>So the good news here is that if you cloned the hard drive then you have the MAC addresses of the hardware you cloned. They cannot modify the MAC addresses so the only way for them to cover this up is to utterly destroy this machine and replace it. </p>
<p>Throw that image up on a torrent as others have suggested, then make NYPD aware of it (anonymously) immediately. Make sure NYPD knows that WTP are aware that they have been exposed and are likely destroying evidence so they should get a warrant ASAP. Even if they wipe their server they can't hide the MAC address so they will have to destroy it. Might suggest to them to go dumpster diving. They (WTP) might be that stupid.</p></p>

<p><p>If this is real, everything you said is super fucking illegal. You detailed how you broke into a company illegally and then stole their stuff, illegally. And their stuff is illegal. Get a damn lawyer and good luck.</p>
<p>edit: who the fuck creates an exe for a simple list? nobody. </p></p>

<p><p>Why would anyone in their right mind want to watch PROOF? If he did post "proof", why would you click on it? And for fuck's sake, if you REALLY DO HAVE THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE - what the hell are you doing on REDDIT?? Get it to the proper authorities! No one wants to watch child porn! I certainly fucking don't. I don't need proof - I know this obscene evil shit happens in the world, so quit fucking around on reddit, and get it to the right authorities.</p></p>
