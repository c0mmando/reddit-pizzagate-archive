<strong>Connecting the international dots, engaging the public</strong>
<p><p>It's clear now that this is bigger than Podesta and Comet Ping Pong. The more we investigate the history of child trafficking and ritual satanic abuse, the more links to other massive cover-ups around the world emerge. </p>
<p>UK, Belgium, Canada, Australia...the rabbit hole keeps going. </p>
<p>Does anyone else think it would be valuable to accumulate documentation of these cases as well? In many cases these are things the public will remember or have had some contact with (Boys Town, Dutreaux, etc) , and demonstrating beyond any fragment of a doubt there there is a pattern in these cases helps lend contextual validity to what people are trying to do here. </p>
<p>We know at this point that the scale of this conspiracy is enormous and implicated members of government organizations who use every resource at their disposal to cover their crimes. These same elites control the media and thus the public perception. </p>
<p>The most critical element that will decide if this investigation is successful will be ENGAGING THE PUBLIC.</p>
<p>The average person has a lot invested in maintaining the status quo and not supporting theories that the MSM calls crazy. We need to give them so much evidence that they can no longer prioritize business as usual over the truth. </p>
<p>Connect the dots! This is so much bigger than Clinton, or even the USA.</p>
<p>Independent researchers, I think we all need to start looking at the rings in your own midst, and link them as concretely as possible to the bigger picture!</p></p>

<p><p>THANK YOU! This needs to be said. </p>
<p>We also have to be careful not to turn it into a pitch-fork wielding witch-hunt (as tempting as that is given the circumstances). </p>
<h2>Requoting something I posted earlier...</h2>
<p>If it is really a global pedo ring, pizza corner in DC is just one small part. Exposing it will not bring down the global ring.</p>
<p>The only way to bring down the global ring is; 1. gathering and preserving evidence 2. slowly getting to word out to the normies so when it hits the fan they will believe us 3. get enough normie support so victims know they will be believed and supported when they come out. Their testimony and support of the community is vital.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage we have is that we have many eyes and ears all over the world, and local expertise. They don't know who we are. We are perfect undercover agents.</p>
<h2>The best thing to do is look in your own neighborhood. You know what to look for now (symbolism), if you don't, learn. Plus you have local knowledge. When it comes out you may have important evidence. Take notes, dates, anything that stands out. Play it low-key. Keep it to yourself for now until you see it linking to something else. Visit your local ping-pong/pizza/bowling/shopping plaza/skater park whatever, note and document anything suspicious. Research the kids that went missing from your town in the last decade, the people involved. Just take note and keep your eyes peeled.</h2></p>

<p><p>Of course it doesnt start and stop in DC. Its everywhere! Theyve been operating like this for years if not centuries. They keep their puppets alligned by collecting the DNA from the the semen / blood after the corrupt political guy has done his business with the kid then they have him by the balls for life. He will be kept in check and will obey all orders. Thats how they get to the top. Dont be surprised to find the most disgusting things up there. Its all a big mafia family. You though Al Capone was big? lol</p></p>
