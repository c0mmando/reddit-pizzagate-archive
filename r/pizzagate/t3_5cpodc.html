<p><p>Not sure if it's related but a day before, 60 people were busted for prostitution. Maybe he ratted out on some people that visited the pizza place?</p>
<p>From what I've read and watched, there is prostitution, child trafficking, and possibly even drug trafficking going on through these different businesses. They are using tunnels in DC. Although I don't know about the rest of the country cause this is definitely nationwide.</p></p>
