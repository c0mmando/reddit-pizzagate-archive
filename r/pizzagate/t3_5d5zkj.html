        <strong>Missing Children in DC</strong>
        <p><p>I haven't been following this all too closely, but has anyone looked into any local DC missing child cases? One recent unsolved case that comes to mind is that of Relisha Rudd. From the start of that case I've felt something very shady was up.</p></p>

        <p><p>Unless there is one glaring peice of evidence like "child went missing near Comet" or "Were briefly seen eating pizza" even if we had a list of missing children we have no way of linking it to anything to do with this.</p>
<p>I mean, unless I am missing something, I can't think how we could possibly begin to correlate any missing cases with information we have, we have a location and a suspicion. I am unsure how we can combine this with missing persons case to get conclusions that professionals trained to find people in missing cases have not already came to. </p></p>

        <p><p>well, 
abductors etc, all have a certain pattern. comfort of location, types of victims etc. if you have a pool of say 20 missing children, all around a 10km radius of comet or say all near pizza joints etc. I certainly think its worth if we have a list of locations of abduction in dc and see if theres anything on the map that shows anything. </p>
<p>Although, the general consensus is that the operation works around illegals and orphans</p></p>

        <p><p>Not that I am trying to discredit anything, but as far as I am aware that consensus is based on a presumed opinion and there is nothing to support it. But if this map turns up anything interesting then so be it :)</p></p>

        <p><p>it definitely won't be any sort of evidence
but if say a map really shows something, thats a very big credibility for a proper investigation. I dont know how to pull up missing cases, definitely will be interesting to see</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, I just mean it's something to consider, not necessarily focus too much on.
And just to respond to your last point, I personally believe DC's homeless population may also be heavily taken advantage of as well.</p></p>

        <p><p>True, it is a difficult sort of thing to pin. I suppose what would be a more reasonable thing to be aware of is if any abductors have any significant connections to Comet or the people who run it.</p></p>
