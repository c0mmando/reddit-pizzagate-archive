    Not sure if it's related but a day before, 60 people were busted for prostitution. Maybe he ratted out on some people that visited the pizza place?

    From what I've read and watched, there is prostitution, child trafficking, and possibly even drug trafficking going on through these different businesses. They are using tunnels in DC. Although I don't know about the rest of the country cause this is definitely nationwide.
