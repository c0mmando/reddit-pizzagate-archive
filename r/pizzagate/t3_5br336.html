        <strong>World Famous Acarya Speaks ~ Hellish planet known as Tamisra</strong>
        <p><p><a href="http://vaniquotes.org/wiki/Hell_known_as_Tamisra">Tamisra</a></p>
<p><strong>A person who appropriates another's legitimate wife, children or money is arrested at the time of death by the fierce Yamadūtas and thrown in hellish planet known as Tāmisra.</strong></p>
<p><em>SB 5.26.8, Translation:</em></p>
<p><strong> My dear King, a person who appropriates another's legitimate wife, children or money is arrested at the time of death by the fierce Yamadūtas, who bind him with the rope of time and forcibly throw him into the hellish planet known as Tāmisra. On this very dark planet, the sinful man is chastised by the Yamadūtas, who beat and rebuke him. He is starved, and he is given no water to drink. Thus the wrathful assistants of Yamarāja cause him severe suffering, and sometimes he faints from their chastisement.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Just like we see varieties of life, so there is life also in the hell, tamisra.</strong></p>
<p><em>Lecture on BG 16.7 -- Hyderabad, December 14, 1976:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pravṛtti means the, what is called, incentive which makes... There is a grain of sugar, and the ant knows there is a grain of sugar. He is running after it. That is pravṛtti. And nivṛtti means I have passed my life in this way, but it is not actually my progress of life. I should stop this way of life. I should go to the spiritual realization. That is nivṛtti-mārga. There are two ways, pravṛtti and nivṛtti. Pravṛtti means we are going to the dark, darkest region. Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisram [SB 7.5.30]. Because we cannot control our senses, adānta... Adānta means uncontrolled, and go, go means senses. Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisram. Just like we see varieties of life, so there is life also in the hell, tamisra. So either you go to the hellish condition of life or you go to the path of liberation, both ways are open to you. So if you go to the hellish condition of life, that is called pravṛtti-mārga, and if you go towards the path of liberation, that is nivṛtti-mārga.</p>

        <p><p>Do you believe Prabupad was poisoned? My uncle was one of his disciples and Prabupad gave him the name "Merli" which I believe is the name of a flute that Krishna played. Are you a Trump supporter, Anti-Hillary, or just spreading your beliefs? Also have you been to the Rainbow Gatherings?</p></p>

        <p><p>Poisoned, not poisoned. Doesn't matter. Srila Prabhupada left his body all the same. Where does your uncle live? Sri Krishna has several flutes of various sizes I believe. Merli doesn't sound like a name for one, no offense.</p>
<p>Any more Prabhupada nectar you can contribute?</p>
<p>No, never been to Rainbow. Seems like a fun time to me though, except for all the hippies.</p>
<p>Hare Krsna.</p></p>

        <p><p>My uncle is in Florida. I do beleive that Merli is a musical instrument whether it be flute or not. I Could be wrong though. I don't know much about him but I heard he was able to speak 23 different languages upon his arrival to Central Park in New York.</p></p>

        <p><p>That doesn't sound true, but it is possible. My spiritual master had all the power of the universe, that is a fact.</p>
<p>The example he frequently gave was that the living entities are like 0's, but immediately when we put a 1 on the end of all those zeroes, we have 1,000,000, or 1,000,000,000, etc etc. But until we find that One, we all remain zeroes.</p>
<p>The implication is that Krsna is the one we are all searching for to make our selves, societies, institutions, whole. Fascinating stuff.</p>
<p>Hare Krsna.</p></p>
