        <strong>You guys need to focus less on potential links and more on the emails.</strong>
        <p><p>Now, I've brought up Pizzagate with quite a few people and the sticking point constantly is, the stretch people are going to so they can connect some potential dots between the Podestas, Aleftankis, Clintons, Child Organisations etc...</p>
<p>Basically if you want mainstream people and media not to ignore this we need MORE SOLID FACTS.</p>
<p>A good friend of mine works for a photography gallery, when I brought up Pizzagate, this person mentioned that the Podestas were frequent customers a few years ago of a certain artist works, which I can tell you are quite graphic and child orientated.</p>
<p>We discussed certain ideas/thoughts people had and the only conclusive evidence we can see in all of this is the original Podesta emails that talk about pizza, pasta, cheese, hankerchiefs etc. </p>
<p>Simply put the media is NEVER going to jump on potential stories of the Clinton foundation killing off investigators, similarities between logos and paedophile symbols at the pizza shops or creepy Instagram photos by the owners. The only time this becomes relevant to the media is generally after they are sure of the guilt of those involved. This way they can run stories which they themselves aren't sure of authenticity but due to the shit storm going on get away with it and no one question sources. But when somethings fresh is when its under scrutiny.</p>
<p>I guarantee you, if either Podesta brother is put on the racks THATS when the media will run all the ambiguous shit but before that they'll keep quiet to protect themselves from potential backlash from some powerful people.</p>
<p><strong>TDLR So my points? Mainstream ain't fully believing it yet. Podesta emails need to be thoroughly examined and every email related to FBI child codewords or any potential code worded emails need to be highlighted and examined as they are the ONLY concrete evidence so far and the only thing keep mainstream people questioning.</strong></p></p>

        <p><p>It blows my mind why asange didnt just dump them all at once, knowing his whole plan could be compromised.  Even his dead man switch didnt work.. why didnt he have a backup plan?</p></p>

        <p><p>Russians, trying to implicate the DNC in shit. If that's the case then this whole sub reddit has been led on the biggest bullshit wild goose chase.</p>
<p>It's already been proven Putins government was putting out a shitload of misinformation during the election all against the DNC. I hate Hilary Clinton, don't get me wrong but another country directly influencing media and politics can't be accepted.</p>
<p>So basically as said before if we can't get any confirmation about the emails being legitimately from Wikileaks/Assange or proof they definitely were not cherry picked/edited prior to release then this whole thing is a waste of time until Wikileaks/Assange says otherwise.</p>
<p>EDIT I'm not saying the Russians have done anything to Assange, but the email hashes not matching and the timing of the releases that directly affected the DNC could be someone taking advantage of the situation to their own ends, which is generally instability of nations these days instead of direct conflict.</p>
<p>EDIT 2 Down vote me all you want, I'm just trying to create discussion and be a voice of reason, we don't want to destroy the lives of people who weren't actually involved because that will only make them go against us. In regards to Russian misinformation read: </p>

<p>The simple fact is, its happening and we have to be careful what evidence we accept as truth/</p></p>

        <p><p>If he wants to stay alive, odds are that's why his "Deadman switch" hasn't gone off yet.</p>
<p>As painful as it is to say, you have to think of it from a logical standpoint and not an emotional one. He's better off hiding/in the safety of a location in which he can't be a target while yes sadly children will still be in harm these next 3 months, however that is but a small amount of time given how long this has been going on for.</p>
<p>So if he is indeed waiting for the right moment to act it's because of this, it's because what is another 3 months to years of perverted actions if it means his time waiting will finally be able to snip this in the butt.</p>
<p>Cause let's be real, this isn't the first time this has been talked about and apparently there have been allegations that go back decades about this, yet how many of us are hearing these accusations towards certain parties for the first time?</p>
<p>So while we might be having an emotional reaction of wanting this to be dealt with swiftly, we have to come to terms that in order to destroy this kind of evil, you have to know when to strike, not act recklessly cause look at the body count that has occurred from people who have tried to take it solo with no known backup on their side.</p></p>

        <p><p>Once the internet was cut everything has gone to 'auto pilot'. </p>
<p>Everything we say here is pretty much conjecture, but he has been one to hold golden eggs close to his chest till the moments ripe. I'm fucking hoping, praying even that this was only a taste and once he's back online we'll see more.</p>
<p>Like I was saying in my main post, this sub is just full of so much conjecture and ambiguous links between people. We need to use the more solid evidence from what we have to push this forward instead of trying to find potential links with zero evidence behind them other then a computer warrior breaking it down in his head.</p>
<p>If we use solid evidence, mainstream media can't ignore it, just like people I've been mentioning it to(one works for a new radio station the other quite big in the art world where I live). They both see the emails as fucked up, but the rest they can't believe(Alefrankis, Clinton links, high rankling paedophile rings)</p></p>

        <p><p>I've been keeping tabs on the whole Assange is missing. General consensus is that he's fine within the embassy with no internet, once internets restored we'll get answers regarding the current emails and whether it was even Wikileaks that released them(since the keys don't match up, we're not even 100% on that now). </p>
<p>Though people are basing this off seeing his cat dressed up in a window that he's ok...</p></p>
