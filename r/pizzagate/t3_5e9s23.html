        <p><p>You can count on media if you clean your act up.</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Leave Obama out of it. Links are too thin and he's liked too much</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For now, leave female Clinton out if it. The public is already quite convinced that she's a fraud, but such a load of serious accusations is frankly hard to grasp. And again, the links are too thin. And she might have part of the public behind her. Feel free to ride on the Podestas though. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave Trump out of it completely. Remember, he's the "orange baboon". You don't want to be seen standing in front of his poster. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quality not quantity. Concentrate on the few emails that do say something. (Map handkerchief, email with pizza image, and the like). The rest is too hard to grasp for the public and frankly looks like a revenge on the Clinton camp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave your opinions about modern art to yourself. You're not gaining supporters by calling it crap. Taste is a personal thing. The "art" is fucked up indeed, but that can be brought up after everything else, as an extra argument. Otherwise you make yourself look crazy. </p>
</li>
</ul></p>

        <p><p>When the government fails us we have the 2nd amendment. Also I'm sure the military will be on our side especially the marines.</p></p>

        <p><p>Dream on. The military is too simple-minded to grasp the entirety of this hell. </p></p>
