<strong>GOOD HUMOR ICE CREAM</strong>
<p><p>So I was seeing the related cp logos by the FBI and I remembered Good Humor ice cream, who's logo is the pink spiral heart. If someone less lazy than me wants to check it out, that would probably be good. </p>
<p>Maybe check the IP addresses, and the known investors and stuff.</p></p>

<p><p>This is an interesting connection. John Wayne Gacy had an ice cream truck that I'm sure was a good humor truck, I just can't find a picture. He was connected and active in politics, and when he was arrested, he asked if any of his associates had been caught as well. Associates he said were directly involved in murders, like his.</p></p>

<p><p>People caught onto that early on, as there were references to good humor ice cream in instagram posts of people associated with Comet Ping Pong.  The names of several Good Humor products sound like sexual innuendo.  e.g. the "Flutsch-Finger."  Flutsch is German for "slippery." Heavy Breathing, a band closely associated with Comet Ping Pong, had a creepy pic on their site of a kid sucking on one with an animated effect added to make his eyes flash demonic-looking light.</p></p>
