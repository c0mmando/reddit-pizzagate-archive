    My story about a hot dog stand and some rough internal things: emailID 30231

   <p>
    Let me tell you a story of an email between JP and I think Todd Stern (tdstern) correct me if I'm wrong
   </p>
   <p>
    https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30231
   </p>

    <strong>
     Original text:
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    The next three months are going to be rougher internally than in
    <em>
     Beijing.
    </em>
    Between
    <em>
     7th
    </em>
    and
    <em>
     1600
    </em>
    , no fun. Hope you're doing ok. 
I'm dreaming about your
    <em>
     hotdog
    </em>
    stand in Hawaii...
   </p>
   <p>
    Complete Speculation but let me explain the key words to you:
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     7th
    </em>
    (class) is the range of age a person has when he or she is in 
7th class in school (eg.1 - 8th class possible)
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     1600
    </em>
    should be a monetary value, plain and simple.
   </p>
   <p>
    He (Stern) refers to it (
    <em>
     Between 7th and 1600
    </em>
    ) not being
    <em>
     fun
    </em>
    .
Maybe he would have preferred something like "3rd" and "300".
Maybe he had some of those in Beijing , that has been less "
    <em>
     rough
    </em>
    "
   </p>
   <p>
    we know there have been a lot of rumours about Hawaii, I guess you can imagine
what that private
    <em>
     HotDog Stand
    </em>
    could be.
   </p>
   <p>
    Whats your idea about this? I know some have been talking about this mail, but 
I thought this would be an attempt to give every line of words a certain meaning.
   </p>
   <p>
    Todd Stern was at least in 2009 in Bejing.

    I was thinking the 1600 has to do with the Whitehouse, which is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

    I think it refers to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (the White House) and the 7th Floor Group, ie the shadow government referenced in the FBI vault postings.

    I think 7th and 1600 refer to two offices... the White House and maybe something on 7th Street in DC? I didn't see any addresses associated with Stern's positions that would qualify (the closest would be 7 World Trade Center NYC, which is associated with Wilmer Hale, where he once worked... in anti-money-laundering, interestingly). The only really suspect thing about this email is the hotdog stand statement.
