    I posted this over in r/the donald as well. I was losing sleep at night literally after being made aware of all this. I have a 4 year old daughter and live within close proximity to DC. It was quick and both agents I spoke with seemed generally concerned after I mentioned the de-classified FBI doc that helped confirm suspicions.

    Use your fucking head and stay the fuck out of this. Why jeopardize you child and family's safety? Please don't be reckless, they're depending on you.
   </p>
   <p>
    You want to do your part? VPN up, read, spread the word. The case is in its infancy and the more traction they think it's getting, the further they'll take it underground.
   </p>
   <p>
    I mean all of this with 0 anger, I genuinely am disgusted by what is going as well. We just need to do our part in spreading the word and not putting our families in the line of fire. These people know how to leverage.

      I honestly don't think I'll be suicided but can never be too cautious. I am not claiming to have done any of the investigating. I watched this thing unfold as it happened. I watched as that fucker took down his IG. I haven't been able to eat, sleep, jerk off, nothing. My family thinks I'm crazy, my shrink wanted to give me more meds. I feel better now that I called the FBI. They said they were documenting everything I said. I don't care about that as I have nothing to hide from them.

       Dude you need to chill out, it's not going to be over for a very long time, probably never truly will. Maybe this will crash the big players in this ring, but you'd still have to go after the various ones in Europe, not to talk about those in China or Japan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just relax and keep living your life man, this has been going on since at least the end of World War 2 where old orders were smashed and empires fell. New power structures emerged and have been working ever since to keep power. Paedophilia is one of those things that indoctrinates the next generation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not worth losing sleep over. I get that you'll be more emotionally invested because you have a young daughter. But just chill out and do your due diligence when you get the chance. When a story about something like this comes up, and someone talks about it at either work or social get together, just casually explain you've known about these things for so and so years and once you know about it's obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of us who has Red-pilled on this issue did so in the wake of new revelations of sex trafficking and corruption. Give others the same chance, read up on some cases(like those stickied at the top of the sub) and casually bring it into the conversation and you'll see people red-pilling each and every chance you do it. They might not be important as an individual, and neither are you or me, but once it breaks in a way they can't hide it, we'll have plenty who has taken the red pill with us.

        Lol this is going to come crashing down so fast and hard, It's all connected. People aren't going to be puppeted around by a bunch of fucking pedophiles once they actually realize what's happening. People just had no idea this was going on. Your disinformation techniques are starting to fail.

     I've been doing that too. Too late to take it underground. I'm not a shill but I'm sure you don't believe me just like the FBI probably didn't believe me. And I can assure you, I'm not the one who blew the investigators silence. If you believe that you are a stupid motherfucker.

    loook...... all this liberal emotionalism is not going to help.
   </p>
   <p>
    The FBI knows about this. They were the ones who pointed Us in this direction and told us to look into this. You don't need to start calling them just because you feel bad.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is really not much different from people who have started attacking those restaurants and acting on our findings.
   </p>
   <p>
    The more you do this the more you will make the perpetrators and it go underground. Making them much harder to bust.
   </p>
   <p>
    James alefantis already Locked his creepy Instagram account, and the besta pizza already change their logo to take the pedophile symbol off.
   </p>
   <p>
    Stuff like this doesn't help us it sets us back by a lot.
   </p>
   <p>
    Your knee-jerk bleeding heart emotionalism is really just going to hurt.

      They knew about this before we did. Imagine being up against the top of the top in DC -- you can't just out the upper echelon of society without causing enormous civil unrest.
     </p>
     <p>
      It's suspected they are trying to point us in the right direction so we can unravel this without as much immense pressure on the entirety of the FBI.

      Please stop your knee jerk reactions and let the people doing the dirty work do the dirty work. This is potentially seriously dangerous stuff and you're not helping by stirring so much noise. Not yet, at least. Tell your friends, tell your family, but do
      <em>
       not
      </em>
      go screaming about it where
      <em>
       they
      </em>
      might hear you.

     This particular ring has probably been known for a long time, but because of the power of those involved, and the possibility of retaliation, it's just not investigated. That's the nature of our world, to think the FBI or other alphabet agencies aren't aware of the global child sex trafficking ring funded by elite circles is just silly, and self-congratulatory. For decades, it's been known that the western leaders indulge in such depravity, and we're all witless associates in their torture campaign. To suggest that we found that out before the intelligence agencies did is mad. To be honest, pederasty has coexisted with power structures since history's onset, so it's sort of a beast to take on. I think the internet will probably help to one day shed light on the victims of this lunacy.

    You all can call me all the dickheads you want but if you had half a brain everyone should be doing the same so they can't ignore it. It's undeniable now. There is no possible way these people can take something this big underground even more now.

      No man. I understand why he did it, we as a collective group would just like to collect as much data as possible, and find some concrete evidence, before we put down the hammer. Concrete evidence like if we can break those pictures or powerpoints down, and also break some passwords.

     Honesty, if enough calls are made, something will be done.
    </p>
    <p>
     That's how it works.
    </p>
    <p>
     If enough people take the time to understand what is going on, then pressure the proper authorities, it will make a huge impact.
    </p>
    <p>
     Taking down the false memory Institute is what will immediately and unequivocally destroy their ability to hide in the shadows. No idea how to approach, it though.
    </p>
    <p>
     We have the opportunity to apply pressure so that all those security apparatus' we approved can be turned on the corruption that created it in the first place.

      It's not like corruption where people can look the other way, this is raping and torturing children. No fucking way this gets swept under the rug.

     Need to contact media outlets too, local ones that aren't owned by big business. Maybe bloggers, not conspiracy ones, but regular people who just like to make videos. The more it spreads, the harder it is to ignore.

     Listen man, calling the FBI ain't going to accomplish shit. They already know, they already ignored it.
    </p>
    <p>
     THAT SAID, your desire to call them anyway is totally rational. It can't hurt to try drawing attention to this. It's pointless, but there is nothing wrong with doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
     All these people jumping on your nuts are either retarded or crazy. Keep being a good citizen, we need more people with a heart like yours.

    Strength in numbers.
   </p>
   <p>
    The more people that report this to the proper jurisdictions, the better.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you report child abuse to your local authorities, they will pass it on to the proper authorities. Don't stop there. You've just created more awareness of this problem in the law enforcement community.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then, report to the proper jurisdiction.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then, report to their boss.
   </p>
   <p>
    Seriously, if thousands of people did this, there would be no stopping it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Strength in numbers.
   </p>
   <p>
    If we are all wrong, so be it. But, we at least no a ton of money laundering is going on. It isn't nothing.
   </p>
   <p>
    We know prostitution occurs at Comet Ping Pong.
   </p>
   <p>
    We know Austyn Crites has a creep looking daycare.
   </p>
   <p>
    We know the Finders investigation was buried.
   </p>
   <p>
    We know the Franklin investigation was buried.
   </p>
   <p>
    If we can tie any of these people to the false memories institute, money wise, it will start to become a slam dunk.

     Nice write-up.

    <p>
     If it's not too much trouble, can someone throw the sources in for each claim?
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm new to this (only spent a few hours in wl and found this sub)
    </p>
    <p>
     When I get off my flight I could do some write-ups too that make it easier to understand if you're just learning about what happened.

      lol bro theyre DDOSing and removing threads all over. they know. its not like theyre keeping their kiddy porn there now anymore. This was gone the 1st day we began suspeting anything.
     </p>
     <p>
      but thats ok - we just need to connect the dots. just becaues we wont find kids in those houses if we break in today, doesnt mean we wont gather enough evidence to link those monsters to these crimes.
     </p>
     <p>
      also, if anything, the pedo alphabets arent manning help lines. you just redpilled an agent.

       It's 4chan, they could be getting DDOS'd because it's Friday. Correlation does not equal causation. I don't know why I'm reading an entire subreddit filled with people who put assumptions way before proof.

        Because that's how real progress is made. You chase down everything to find the stuff that sticks. Community driven investigations like this are messy by their very nature. Embrace it. The journey is half the fun.

       I was thinking of a kiddie porn sting in January, but that is also a good one.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no evidence to suggest the FBI is corrupt. Compromised, possibly, but only in the sense that they can be pressured from outside.

        Agree, probably two big forces working against each other. 
People working on the good side of these cases maybe even don't know with whom they are working with and only see parts of the investigation. 
The ones on top should have a clear picture on what is going on.

      I really hope that the FBI (and Trump, for that matter) are not corrupt but here are my two cents on why the FBI would prosecute online pedo rings even if they are involved in the american elite pedo ring.
     </p>
     <p>
      The evidence for this goes back to at least 1990 with the Franklin case. Seeing as how this predates the internet we can expect this ring to have been set up to operate entirely offline and there isn't much reason for them to start operating online except make money off rando pedos coming in. You don't grow a ring of global elites by working with people you met on the internet.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regulatory capture for a pedophile ring only works if the ring operates in the physical world. There are no geographical limits of jurisdiction for digital investigations and rarely any court approval required. Even if they took over the FBI's online investigation units they would have to be wary of any other digital investigators across the globe.
     </p>
     <p>
      For these two reasons its safe to assume that the bulk of their operations are offline and what we do see online is just the result of them being sloppy.
     </p>
     <p>
      They have no reason to interfere with the FBI taking down pedophile rings operating online because those rings are their  competitors and there are only so many consumers to go around.

       Nah. We don't actually have concrete proof yet. So I don't see how this can produce any benefit. Though, it may harm our efforts (FBI may not want vigilantes if this is  legit case, maybe FBI have connections with the pedophiles, etc...)

        Yeah honestly making this stuff have high visibility is probably the exact opposite of what the FBI wants if they are actually working on taking this down.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some of the people involved seem to be catching wind and ideally you'd want them clueless and acting careless as they have been

    just imagine where the US would be if our leadership wasn't so focused on fucking kids!!  we'd probably have flying cars by now.

    but on a serious note i'm glad people are calling.  They may try and hide but the more people are talking about it the more we can fight it.  Fighting in dark hasn't gotten nearly as far enough.

    Don't go doing random shit. Let people keep digging. Don't spend all day fighting as it gets a bit much especially if you come across CP (which is very possible). Just lets do this methodically and not (as one post suggested)  'leave notes around neighbourhoods telling people to Google pizzagate' that is really not going to help.

    Well, as soon as I saw their google reviews getting kek'd I said fuck it I'm calling. If they suicide me? Fuck it I tried and hopefully eventually they get those bastards too. And I told everyone close to me that I would NEVER kill myself so if they find me with a note and two bullet holes in my head, it could be foul play. :^(
   </p>
   <p>
    ETA: Before people call me a dumbass, I held out and wasn't the first the bomb their google reviews. I waited till someone else blew their cover lol

     Bombing restaurant reviews based on rumor and innuendo is merely a good way to get yourself sued, or worse. I don't recommend it.
    </p>
    <p>
     I think the best we can hope for is to allow the qualified people who are digging continue to dig and compile, and wait for the changing of the guard. Trump doesn't get sworn in until January 20th. Then pressure can be put on him to appoint a special investigator or something. Nothing is going to happen with the current leadership situation at DoJ and FBI.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just don't be stupid. If even 10% of the stuff regarding pizzagate turns out to be real, it's appalling and fucked up. But also don't forget that people are just taking shots in the dark right now. Just because someone thinks they made a connection doesn't make it gospel. These are extremely serious crimes that these people are being accused of. Don't act crazy. Don't go lynching people in the public square without evidence. It WILL backfire on you.

     There are things much worse than death, if this shit is true you think they will just suicide you? You would be lucky if that's all that happens. These sick fucks need to be taken down for sure but if they do take action against you death will be what you will beg for.

      That's pretty standard though. They need to be able to trace things back to the source. Imagine if they were investigating an arson and they figured out you mentioned something that only the arsonist wouldn't have known. They want to be able to come back and ask you about it. They probably don't feel they will need it in this case, but you never know so they take it anyway.

    I'm pregnant so I'm terrified to get involved. I don't even go to 8chan as much anymore because I don't want to cause trouble, and I never feel like a VPN is enough.

    From my experience with the FBI, they need solid evidence to start digging.  They won't even look at it until we find something like an email in Podesta's inbox that has a hidden steganographic message with illegal images or some sort of direct connection to something nasty.  We need to keep digging.

     Well I'm sorry man. I want some answers. I really don't care who this guy is, he's got pedo logos in his signs per the FBI document and he's got someone's baby taped to a damn table on his IG. We're paying taxes so they can prey on our children?!?

      I'm not saying anything against your intent.  I'm just speaking from my background as a professional investigator; without ample explicit evidence they won't lift a finger, especially considering the high-profile nature of the allegations.  Remember, they receive THOUSANDS of tips from "conspiracy theorists" every day: people who are seeing the men in black, people who feel the government is hacking into their brains, etc.  I even see it a lot in my small-scale work.  While the concern in this case may be legit, the amount of evidence present has to rise to a standard that they cannot possibly think it's anything but a legitimate case.
     </p>
     <p>
      I'm right there with you: something is going on here, but they will likely just round-file this until we have enough evidence to actually prove something.

       But hell, that list of paedophile symbols was issued by the FBI themselves. Now whe have a sketchy pizza bussiness with using that logo institutionally. It warrants at least some further inquiry.

    You know what, good for you. Assuming the FBI know all about it and are choosing to do nothing is assuming a lot.
   </p>
   <p>
    Do the feds know about ALL places like that peppered throughout the entire country? Maybe, but more than likely not.
   </p>
   <p>
    Who knows what might come of it, and really since it's starting to be plastered all over the internet, what harm can it do.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ultimately they are the ones who could actually do something about it so why not get them involved.

      What disinformation is he providing? He is bringing up a very valid point about the OP doing this for the karma.
     </p>
     <p>
      He even mentions that it is out of good faith that the OP may be doing it... Do you just see disinformation in everything?

      Now I know I never should have tried. Good luck, man. You know what's just as bad as child trafficking? Being raised by an unfit, unstable, uneducated, delusional, narcissist.

       No you didn't, this type of post is the same thing as someone posting a photo of themselves on facebook hoping to get likes. These kind of posts don't help the sub at all. Still, for some reason it's not normal to call people out on this shit, the same way it's not cool to call out that chick on her selfie.

       You're literally talking about conspiracy to commit murder. Btw there still isn't enough evidence to bring up charges, let alone make a case.

       Honestly you kinda sound like a moron right now.
