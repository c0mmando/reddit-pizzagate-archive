        <p><p>They are all incriminating in their own way but for me the empty refrigeration room with the comment "oh yeah this looks fun" followed later by #killroom (from the guy who had child sized coffins on his Instagram) and #murder in response is the best one.
I've not had anyone rationally explain why an empty room would elicit such responses.</p></p>

        <p><p>Because it looks kinda creepy? Note also the response about locking werewolves in there or hiding money. The commenters are riffing on how an empty industrial cooler looks.</p>
<p>I recently finished a project where we did a rush job cleaning out a basement space as a workshop, we didn't have the budget or time to do anything about the crumbling walls or ceiling. Many of my employees referred to it as "The murder basement" I assure you, we didn't kill anyone there. It's simply a fairly obvious kind of joke.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not really sure, I don't know the person, or their sense of humor, or their history. Much of social media that is not done by professionals amount to in-jokes that one's closest social circle would get.</p>
<p>I could imagine that the #needthis#wantthis are referring to the expression on the child's face, speaking in the baby's supposed interior voice. I hope #baby and #pasta and g#ginger don't need explanation to you. As for #gaybaby, I'd guess some sort of in joke, perhaps about that baby which likely is the child or relative of that poster.</p>
<p>That may or may not be correct, but it feels far more plausible as "I want to have sex with that toddler and I'm going to post about it publicly." That's an insane interpretation.</p>
<p>EDIT: Okay, did a search and it turns out that the tag #gaybaby was used extensively on national coming out day for gay adults to post pictures of themselves as children. Since looking at the image it doesn't seem to be particularly modern, a very good possibility is that it is a picture of the poster as a baby.</p></p>

        <p><p>But he never posted it "publicly" he used code words for the most part, so the gay baby is covered in pasta?</p>
<p>Also cboutlier is gay, does that help with the context?</p></p>

        <p><p>I was born blonde, as an adult, I have dark brown, almost black hair. It's pretty common for babies to have lighter hair than they will eventually.</p>
<p>But that may not be him, you're right. I'll tell you though, before looking it up, I never imagined that it might be him. The world is so big and so complex that "I can't think of why" isn't good evidence for something sinister. It could say "gaybaby" because he is a homophobe and he's making fun of a baby that he thinks looks gay. Maybe the child's parents are a gay couple and that's a tongue in cheek way that friends refer them as a gay family.  Or any of a million reasons neither of us would imagine. Seriously, look up all those tags on twitter and see the confusing variety of things they actually refer to.</p>
<p>Here's the takeaway. The world is weird. And weird is really mostly a shorthand for "I don't understand it right now". To make the leap from not understanding something, to suspecting horrible crimes is conspiracy thinking, it's saying you don't know, so you know.</p></p>
