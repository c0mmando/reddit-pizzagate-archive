    Did you see how much he paid for his new home? Seems like a weird amount.
    <em>
     Sussex County property records show he took out a $273,000 mortgage to buy the pale yellow colonial and carriage house for  $606,666 in 1995. As the converted inn, built in 1793, continued to rise in value, Brock refinanced his loan on at least two occasions. Records show he had a $1.44 million mortgage on the property, as well as two more loans against the home totaling just over $500,000.

      Rehoboth is probably going to play in this, too. Biden is there a lot. Presidents and their families go there. Lots of political players go there. Very close to Henlopen Acres, which is big and old money. Delaware itself is full of big and old money (not just the duPonts). Families there hundreds of years and generational Freemasons. Also not far from where the pedophile pediatrician was doing his evil, too.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rehoboth isn't the only ocean town, but it sure is where all these people go.
     </p>
     <p>
      And now I officially am terrified of where I grew up.

     From an article and commentary at the time
    </a>
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     "Please finish this today so I don’t have to waste my time emailing anyone – Biden, Coulter, Carlson, Huffington, Drudge, Ingraham," Grey wrote in a 2008 email.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Next step is I contact all your donors and the IRS," Grey wrote in an email dated May 19, 2010. "This is going to stink for you if you do not resolve this now."
    </p>
    <p>
     Brock said in court papers that he paid Grey "under duress."
    </p>
    <p>
     Paying off Grey may not have been easy for Brock, even with his salary of nearly $300,000 at Media Matters. Records show Brock had pulled massive amounts of equity from the six-bedroom Rehoboth Beach house as its value skyrocketed during the real estate bubble.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Media Matters was a mouthpiece used by the globalists to put their puppet obama into power.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Grey, who relocated to Mass., declined to comment when contacted by FoxNews.com. Brock and Alefantis remain in Washington, where Brock has released a new book attacking Fox News. He is also under scrutiny from several members of Congress amid reports Media Matters for America is in possible violation of IRS laws governing nonprofits.

     We can also find out what Will Grey had...or start peeling back the layers.  We can make Will Grey speak if we can prove he hid evidence of pedophilia for some dollar bills.  He's no saint here, he's complicit

      William Grey?
Around what age is he? I know someone named that. I mean, hardly likely, but worth knowing who I am looking for.
