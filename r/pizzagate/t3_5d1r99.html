        <strong>Pizzare - a pizza joint right next to Dr. Pong in Berlin GOES DOWN within MINUTES of me accessing the site!</strong>
        <p><p>So I was researching Dr. Pong, the place in Berlin which has a confirmed FAKE menu item of 'Andro Susskind' (andro never has made such an item, susskind is 'sweet child' in German) which is defined by Dr. Pong as 'sticky as a long summertime fuck', when I noticed that right next door to Dr. Pong is a pizza place called Pizzare.</p>
<p>Their site is really poorly designed, seems to be a Wordpress site, just a logo placed noticeably stupidly behind a picture of some cooks, and a mailto: email link at the top, NO MENU to be found on the single page site.</p>
<p>I started inspecting the sources, found the logo file which was hidden on the site, came back a few minutes later and the site is DOWN.</p>
<p>pizzare.com</p>
<p>I did manage to take a screenshot, but it's not the original image.</p>
<p>WTF IS GOING ON</p>
<p>edit: screenshot is http://imgur.com/a/L5PW9 i just used the snipping tool</p>
<p>edit2: site is back up</p></p>

        <p><p>Nothing suspicious IMO here. Probably just a really small place, not popular or financed enough to pay for some exposure plus decent website.</p></p>

        <p><p>I thought the same thing, that's why I didn't archive it. Was just really surprised when it immediately went down.</p></p>

        <p><p>yes, but in my eyes it does not make much sense in relation to pingpong/tabletennis. googled it and one of the only matches
was an article about 
DR PONG
the exact loaction mentioning it to be a special sticky rubber layer for the paddle/racket.
BUT if you google "tischtennis süßkind" or "andro süßkind" only matches referring to table tennis/ping pong is DR.PONG</p></p>

        <p><p>I would like to point out that Wordpress-based sites are having severe technological issues within the past 2 years due to brute-force password intrusion through wp-login.php.</p>
<p>Lots of sites using wordpress are going down or having spam links added to them through automated attacks from over 90,000 unique IP address.</p></p>
