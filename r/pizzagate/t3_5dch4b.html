        <strong>Does anyone have evidence that the Madeleine McCann sketches are of two different people? We need to settle this one way or the other.</strong>

        <p><p>I know that police have said they are looking for multiple suspects, this is irrelevant to the question at hand.  </p>
<p>What we need to find out is whether <strong>the police believe the two efit sketches now represent two suspects</strong>. At the time of their drawing, the sketches were believed to represent the same person.</p></p>

        <p><p>I've mentioned elsewhere that it is possible that they were spotted with a different girl that fit Madeleines description.   This would explain why a kidnapper (or maybe they were just there hanging out $$$ with someone's child) would be out in public with the girl and could be seen. </p>
<p>I don't see how those two sketches could be of the same person unless one of the witnesses was blind. It's like laurel and hardy. </p></p>

<p>It's likely due to the fact that the Smith's each recounted their own version of the man they saw.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Descriptions of the suspect were given to the Portuguese inquiry by two witnesses after Madeleine disappeared.    </p>

<p>The Oakley team produced e-fits based on the Smiths' description</p>

        <p><p>You are right, but regardless they are brothers and look alike.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah totally, there's also the possibility that the Smith's saw the two brothers and confused them for the same person. However I think it's important that we only report on what we know to be the case until shown otherwise.  </p>
<p>Though I personally think it's unlikely the Podesta's were physically involved with the kidnapping.</p></p>
