<strong>NEW LEAD ALERT - POTENTIAL LEAD MACCOBY</strong>
<p><p>Found a lead.</p>
<p>I was listening to the audio recordings of the Commissionary Meetings of 2008, where the guy accused Comet Ping Pong of Murder and Rape. </p>
<p>Then one guy VEHEMENTLY defended James Alefantis' new plan for permitting Comet Ping Pong to operate at midnight, and I spent an hour trying to discern who that guy was.</p>
<p>MP3 found in links below. File name includes "COMET". Go to 31:30.</p>
<p>http://voices.washingtonpost.com/rawfisher/2008/06/dc_official_outdoor_seats_at_p.html (ctrl+f audio, will link you to audio files)</p>
<p>Otherwise directly here: https://sites.google.com/site/mitalgandhi/anc3fmeeting</p>
<p>He identified his name and address, but it wasn't very clear at the beginning, I could only pick out certain parts like "4825 Linnean". Turns out he was Michael Maccoby from 4825 Linnean Avenue, which was the address of the Maccoby Group company. He's even appeared on Sky News recently.</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Maccoby</p>
<p>This is supposedly a "government contracting" company, yet his primary hobby seems to be a "psychoanalyst" of Mexican peasants. He even has research articles published about it. </p>
<p>Question: Why is this government-contracting company's CEO so adamant on the pizza restaraunt operating after midnight? He literally said: “If this place rejects what James is trying to do, it would be an outrage. A serious detriment. And it's inexplicable. And I would personally seek to remove the individuals who attempt to stop him.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>Keep this separate from the fact that we found a new lead, but here's another guy.</p>
<p>The guy who accused Comet Ping Pong of "rape and murder" in 2008 received a barrage of attacks in 2008 by Washington Post. Almost of these articles (more than 5) were written by the same guy, Marc Fisher. </p>

<p>Marc Fisher has his own separate Wikipedia page, he currently actively writes articles that attack Donald Trump. </p>

<p><p>Holy shit...the guy who accused Comet of the "rape and murder", who "Fisher" is trying to argue against in these articles, is the same guy who uploaded the video of the child "screaming" outside Comet. His complaints here &amp; in the vid are about playing pingpong in a public space, but maybe he was on to something else? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHXBrEXmowo</p></p>

<p><p>This CEO middle aged man just wants to eat pizza and play Ping Pong till the wee hours of the morning, why do you have to make it seem weird? </p>
<p>Edit: Jesus seriously? Is it not obvious that there IS something weird about it??? I thought I'm being pretty clear with sarcasm </p></p>

<p><p>These kind of ironic posts are not funny enough to justify the confusion they create. Humour gets lost often times in written language. I suggest to avoid these kind of posts. Props to OP for the research. The key points we get out of OPs research is that 1. the guy who went out of his way to defend Alefantis has consulted Orphanges, governments, the World Bank, unions, research and development centers and laboratories. Our autists def should do some more research on this guy (Michael Maccoby) and 2. a senior editor of the washington post (Marc Fisher) kept attacking the guy who was accusing Alefantis of pedo stuff. </p></p>

<p><p>It was obvious, mate, but our autists can't pick up on it that easily. You'll just have to forgive 'em, just remember they're on our side and that's what counts.</p></p>

<p><p>Less drama and more facts. He didn't accuse CPP of rape and murder, he alluded to the fact that with a later licence that rapes and murders would occur more often in the area. 
His comments were "...James is trying to turn this into Adams Morgan, with the murders, the rapes..."
Also, those two guys look nothing alike, even accounting for age. A lot of people are getting way too excited and are started to see things that aren't actually there. Time to take a breather.</p></p>

<p><p>I don't want to divert the attention to the discussion of whether they are the same person, considering the importance of this thread is the fact that we've got a brand new lead to investigate; someone who attended a neighborhood meeting for his first time, for the sole purpose of allowing CPP to operate after midnight along with a huge crowd. Honestly, the fact that this was the FIRST man to speak, makes this whole thing seemed scripted as hell. If you listen to the applauses you can see that they're using fear tactics to overwhelm the commisioners, who are all professional and humble, yet irritated as hell by Alefantis' war tactic.</p>
<p>But here's the comparison anyway. How is that not an aged version of the same person? http://sli.mg/aEQ0t7</p></p>
