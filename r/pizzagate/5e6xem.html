     Edit: I was permanently banned for posting Anthony Weiner and Bill Clinton's cell phone numbers and emails off of 8ch.net/pol (I can only let you guys know via edits). I am going to make a new account with a name that is obviously similar, but won't be picked up by algorithms looking for ban subversions. So if you see u/omotoyiw etc etc. That's me. I'll provide proof if someone claims it's not me. Just PM my new account.

     There will be a revolution. It is not about the pedophilia. This is a method of blackmail by which our politicians are controlled. They sell their souls to Soros, Rothschild, etc by giving them damning evidence of their crimes against humanity. In return, they wield the propaganda power of our media, the economic power of our banks and businesses, and the judicial power of our secret government. They must not diverge from the visions of their masters. It's no different than the Sinaloa cartel or the Italian mafia, it's just a global occurrence. The fathers of the Rothschilds and Soros's today are the same men whom Hitler tried to expel from Germany, and did in the 1930's. The only mistake he made was he lost. Most of our history on Nazi Germany was written by these Jewish bankers and business men. Look into it for yourselves. We live in a propaganda state. Keep in mind that I have no problem at all with regular Jews. I have a problem with the bankers and highest businessmen who own our country, who just happen to be Jewish (15 to 30 people). I like Bernie Sanders. I like affirmative action. I like nationalized health care. I'm liberal, not a neonazi. I respect those who disagree with me, as I feel the forces we are combating do not know political party lines.

     With that said. We are united against this syndicate. If you are American. If you are British. If you are Canadian. If you are Turkish. If you are Indian. If you are Polish. If you are Russian. If you are a citizen of this Earth. Fight. Fight for your bloodline and for your people and your land. We will not battle each other. History is going to stop repeating itself. We are going to overthrow this international clique. We don't need a one world government. We need a world free of hatred and the manipulation of countries against each other. The idea that the "other is evil" is a fiction created to distract us from a monolithic conspiracy raping our world.

        First off, it wasn't (at least according to any reputable, non-idealogical revisionism groups), second, it doesn't matter if it was because the resulting Holocaust and actions by the SS and Wehrmacht is undeniable.

         Please see the edit. All I am trying to say is that it is natural for the numbers to be embellished and that we should keep in mind that the Nazi's were trying to remove this syndicate, and if they turned into a Jew killing antisemitic machine (mountains of evidence supporting this), then we should NOT repeat their mistakes. We can destroy the syndicate and stay ourselves at the end of the day. We are strong.

          No, the weren't. They were trying to kill
          <em>
           Jews
          </em>
          . Notice how it doesn't require that we explicitly murder the population of Israel in order to arrest and charge Podesta and co.
         </p>
         <p>
          Of course there will be discrepancies of the actual number, teh camp records were sketchy at best seeing as most prisoners weren't even processed, just taken straight to the chambers, combined with the fact that many camps were burnt down before being abandoned and all had records in varying amounts expunged. This also ignores the fact that a large percentage of the populations where genocide was practiced by the Nazis died due to the Einsatzgruppen in occupied territories or due forced labor in places such as Peenemunde and the various Mittelwerks.
         </p>
         <p>
          You are also being disingenuous by giving limited information to all other possibilities but the lowest casualty rate by
          <strong>
           emphasizing

          it and spending more time than necessary on it.

         for certain. Any number of innocent dead is terrible. I don't personally care how many died.

         If it were a contest, Mao and Stalin would far surpass anything anyone else has done by a factor of 50. Its just the way their state apparatuses worked during their extermination events. The key is to never allow such things to happen again so long as we can help it.

        I just want a source to start with.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm very hesitant to take you at your word because of how well documented many of the events in Nazi history is. I don't think it was necessary to embellish the Nazi atrocities.
       </p>
       <p>
        As far as the Wansee Conference Transcript, I learned in my college's Holocaust class that there was no clear order given by Hitler regarding the final solution - that this was entrusted to Himmler. I wasn't even aware there was a transcript - and just because there was an attempt to produce evidence that would link Hitler to something we all can safely assume he was well aware of does not mean all the events surrounding that document are exaggerated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Honestly this type of talk is going to scare people away from this sub and is damaging the cause of raising awareness of pizzagate.

           You fundamentally misunderstand what I'm saying. Jews... Muslims... Chinxs... Niggers... Terrorists... Commies... they've all been scapegoats at times. Let's have a revolution. We are the only people to blame. It is nobody's fault.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are plenty of people calling for the "mass incarceration and murder" of Muslims............ Let's not.

            Trump is not going to persecute Muslims, that is all propaganda from the media. But we can agree on that point at least.

        There are literally hundreds of thousands of historians who would become instantly famous if they could submit researched work proving any of this. Now I'm not unaware that contrarians can be unpopular in any of the sciences but come on man - this topic has been studied to death and was purposely documented heavily at the time just so this type of stuff would not be able to gain traction.

         What are you talking about? The whole idea is that nobody can prove for sure. We know A LOT of people were slaughtered, but I am just showing you that the estimates (!) have changed over time. It is a good discussion considering the overthrow of this syndicate by a grassroots nationalistic movement is pretty similar to Nazi Germany. Lets avoid their mistakes. Let's not pull a holocaust after realizing what they realized.

          I feel like you can make that argument without debating the number of dead. That is not the only point you are trying to make because you keep returning to this line of reasoning.
         </p>
         <p>
          You could literally just say "let's not scapegoat anyone to avoid something like the holocaust" and your point would be made. Why are you so insistent on proving that less people died than they claim? Why does it even matter - in fact it seems to be counter intuitive to your point.

       you should watch this video, it's just over 8 minutes.  Then watch the rest of the videos in the playlist.  Then The Ultimate History with John Taylor Gatto.  Then keep the research alive!

        Highly doubtful, he was against Clinton (and against CP by proxy), although it's entirely possible that he was a puppet candidate the elites wanted to appease the majority but then fell out of favor because Clinton convinced with the dosh.

        Agreed, I was drawing reference to the Rick Ross/Jay Z song where they more or less suggest that they are the devil and that's how they rose to power within the Illuminati.  A little conspiracy tangent from me, sorry

    I want to take this small opportunity to point out that "conspiracy" does not mean "baseless paranoia."  It's thanks to decades of intentional Orwellian dissociation that we've forgotten what conspiracies actually are,
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     "a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful."
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    This sub is inherently rooted in conspiracy... because we're
    <em>
     investigating a conspiracy
    </em>
    !!!  It's people like Alefantis that want to turn the phrase back on us like a weapon to discredit us.
   </p>
   <p>
    I think it should be one of the underlying talking points of this sub because people's gut reactions have been systematically programmed to reject the truth.  And that is a huge problem.

     There is a difference between a conspiracy theory with legitimate evidence backing it up and a conspiracy theory that is PURE speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
     I will edit my post to clarify.

      no i get you.  Sorry if I came off as attacking you.  I'm mad at what's been done to the word.  It's unfortunate that we all understood what you meant.  the clarification is appreciated though.

    Keep up the work, MSM will need to break this soon if we continue at this rate, infact if they continue to ignore it - it just makes it all the more damning.

    Dang I remember when this sub just started up, I joined when we had 177 subs.  Glad to see that more people are getting it into their heads that this is no joke and goes way deeper than some mere coincidences.

     Been here since the day after it started. Went off into monarch mind control and Montalk's beginner's guide to fringe thought followed by the entire archives..... I've gone a long way in the last 2 weeks, partially because of having been previously primed by those around me already aware of such things.

    Is it because of Molly and Zero? They are still going at it :) I just don't like reporting it to Twitter. Sure we've stopped the show online, but people/children are still being hurt. I doubt the govt will do anything meaningful. The agencies involved in the law MUST know that this is going.
