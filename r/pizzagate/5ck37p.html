    I've been reading a lot of stuff from abuse survivors. People we would have most likely dismissed prior to this.  They seem to be saying exactly what the connections we are uncovering are saying.  I think a ton of info can be gained from using this approach and working backwards

    I was looking through paintings by Kim noble who is apparently an abuse survivor, a lot of her paintings are very disturbing

    One of Kim Nobles paintings reminded me a bit of the ping pong tables and what they might refer to as ping pong

    Here's another one of her paintings

    Maybe she just watched the movie. Who knows.   But I feel like there are a lot of stories out there of people explaining what happened to them, and maybe they are a lot more credible than we previously assumed

    The Maria woman who arranged the Spirit Cooking email has been on record saying how she's had 3 abortions. Read into this as you may.

    Symbology is a stronger language than written words for many. Symbols pre-date the written works and the roots are strong. This lives on.

    Many people here I recommend to study wiccan symbols. I think the up/down triangles are fire and water signs and pointing together show the female (butterfly). This represents fertility.
