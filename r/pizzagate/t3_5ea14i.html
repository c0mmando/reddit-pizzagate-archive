<strong>Comet's .com protected/ folder</strong>
<p><p>You might have seen this: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cx2vLIDUUAA82d4.jpg:large</p>
<p>I found it on twitter, I hadn't seen it before. The guy told me how to fetch the files without the key.</p>
<p>All the files actually had a pdf header (even the .txt file) but somehow wouldn't display in a PDF reader.</p>
<p>I extracted all images with poppler-utils and... there's nothing to see there: http://sli.mg/dT0GUN</p>
<p>I suspect they just use some proprietary menu printing hard/software that uses its own obfuscated zip/pdf format. The same pictures were recovered from all the files.</p>
<p>As much as I hoped this was the ultimate proof and as much as I was scared to open them, this is very ordinary stuff.</p>
<p><strong>edit: This might still be it... the files I fetched all have the same md5sum and sizes do not reflect what we see on the screenshot. Deliberately misleading maybe ?</strong></p>
<p>Here is the md5sum for the bogus files: 40945f377df25ec64457f88e4bcfb40b</p></p>

<p><p>If it's big like we think, I doubt they just letting stuff on the server... They know all of this scandal and they know they have to be more discret.
But gj ;) I really hope someone can make some really good evidence about all this shit.</p></p>

<p><p>I tried downloading the files without a key after it was discovered. Looks like the site requires you to have the correct key, before it downloads the correct file. It always downloaded the same ~7MB zip-file, which was the menu of the place after renaming the suffix to .pdf.</p>
<p>This was after the first image you linked started circulating, so no way to check if the ULDL-area exists, unless you can crack the password to the protected-area.</p></p>

<p><p>Indeed... all those files have the same md5sum and the listed sizes do not match.</p></p>

<p><p>You can make over $100,000 each child per year. Don't think they'd be hiring amateurs for their operational security... They're opposite from amateurs, professional and experienced mafia. Don't underestimate them. </p></p>

<p><p>You are probably right, but still, doesn't hurt to check. As far as i know, pedostrash love this technique.</p>
<p>Also, i don't believe they'r stupid. I believe they'r just over confident and cheeky</p></p>

<p><p>My theory is that they are over confident. They hired someone to do their security so they don't have to. It's a false sense of security trap, and it's in our favor.</p></p>

<p><p>Guys are you NOT thinking? This page was exposed weeks ago, why does everyone think James is a dummy even know he is a fucking prick. He MOST Likely moved the files out a while ago and replaced them. Unless the hashes match </p></p>
