    Ok, I hope this might be the right thread for this, didn't want to open a completely new one. 
But I stumbled upon something that might sound a bit far fetched and crazy at first, but there are some strange similarities.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is about Conspiracy theorist Max Spiers who died on october, 17th this year under strange circumstances in Poland. I'm looking into him for the first time.
Seems like most of the things he was believing is total nonsense,
but it is mentioned that he spoke about a satanic cult under the elites what seemed to be one of the last things he researched.
   </p>
   <p>
    This guy gives a good summary about Spiers and his Death:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh93MgiwGig
   </p>
   <p>
    Think about this like in the Simpsons episode 
'The Computer Wore Menace Shoes' where Homer just invents crazy theories and suddenly one of them is on point true and he gets involved.

     He was specifically investigating the Presido Child Center where over 60 children were suspected of being abused.

     I think this link is going to be the one that pushes us forward.

       No need to be worried about educating yourself
       <br/>
       This sub alone has more than 6000 users, so no the
       <em>
        last
       </em>
       person who looked into this didn't suddenly die - one person who looked into this has died, and most likely it didn't have anything to do with his looking into things, just because the article mentioned the x-files.

       Try googling presidio daycare or presidio daycare scandal. It has been pretty well covered over the years, books have been written on the subject and the authors are safe and well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Try looking into the process church of the final judgement if you haven't already and see if they aren't part of this rabbit hole too, somehow their paw-prints seem all over this

         ...the Silicon Valley elite working through US intel.   Jan Irvin, Hans Utter, Steve Outrim and even Maury Terry (though I think Trey is a coopted idiot or provocateur) have shown this to be real though it's a lot of circumstantial evidence,  but a lot of circumstantial evidence can get people convicted in some cases so there's that.  The process church is also connected to scientology,  Manson, the Atlanta child murders,  the son of Sam cult,  animal sacrifice, drug trafficking,  the station island killings,  an elite group of NY pedophiles,  Samuel Untemyer (illuminati scumbag Oligarch),  and remnants of the church now live in Utah (occult Witch country) where they run a dog rescue center,  which a sick ironic little twist. They are probably a CIA/MI5 cult.

        The process church is also one of latest incarnations of the do what though wilt/Crowley/OTO//Masonic/Lurian Kabbala/Rabelaisian/Sabbatean/Frankist derivative of evil antinomian craziness. It's the same game plan with these guys,  take normal morality and flip it upside down and make it an ethical imperative. David Livingstone writes about about this stuff,  as well as the Collins brothers. One of my favorite blogs before it went defunct, Rigorous Intuition,  used to cover a lot of this info as well.

    What specifically ties him to Aquino?

    What is significant about an Army Cookbook?

     The link between podesta and Aquino is that podesta is shown supporting Set, and Aquino founded the church of Set. Further, Aquino has raped many children, and podesta has mountains of circumstantial evidence towards his own pedophilia
    </p>
    <p>
     EDIT: I think I know the meaning of the army cook book.
    </p>
    <p>
     1) she asks about the dinner plans, then asks if he received the cook book. She needed to clarify if he did or not, because its not a spirit cooking book.
    </p>
    <p>
     2)He clarifies he received it.
    </p>
    <p>
     3) she already knew exactly what meals they would be making. Down the the last ingredient. look at that fuckin meal plan. "Mixed grill of Tandoori chicken, lamb, and Lahori fish: Pizza oven." You wont find that in any Army cook book. dessert is a "block" of ice cream.
    </p>
    <p>
     From this I believe the meal plan may be code, and the army cook book is the cypher.
    </p>
    <p>
     plus, look at how intricate that meal is! that is how these people eat. What the hell would tony want with a legitimate army cook book?

       This is solid. I am going to consider the Osiris/Set thing debunked in regards to the Podesta photo, unless some other compelling evidence shows up.

         Oh absofuckinglutely. There are WAY too many coincidences to write off. I would say we have reached the probable cause standard at this point.
        </p>
        <p>
         We should investigate everything however, even crazy 14 fish thingys.

       Counterpoint:
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a very stark difference between the way everyone else is doing it and the way Podesta is showing support.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the idea of plausible deniability and a double meaning thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying you're wrong, but the differences (at least for me) are too much to pass up. As of now it's just something that I'll file away in my mind. As was said in the cryo link thing, being able to pass messages back and forth could be the changing of one variable. That way it's hidden in plain sight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was there anything else going on at the same time is a question that needs to be answered.

      Even if we grant that Podesta is shown supporting Set, that does not tie him personally to Aquino.

      What is significant about an Army Cookbook?

       What is this army cookbook?  Is it a file? You'd have to cook the pasta and the walnut sauce somewhere.  Bake the pizza somewhere.  Is a file of places? Of people? Is it more codespeak? I'm just guessing here.  This is truly bizarre behavior.

        <p>
         EDIT: I think I know the meaning of the army cook book.
        </p>
        <p>
         1) she asks about the dinner plans, then asks if he received the cook book. She needed to clarify if he did or not, because its not a spirit cooking book.
        </p>
        <p>
         2)He clarifies he received it.
        </p>
        <p>
         3) she already knew exactly what meals they would be making. Down the the last ingredient. look at that fuckin meal plan. "Mixed grill of Tandoori chicken, lamb, and Lahori fish: Pizza oven." You wont find that in any Army cook book. dessert is a "block" of ice cream.
        </p>
        <p>
         From this I believe the meal plan may be code, and the army cook book is the cypher.
        </p>
        <p>
         plus, look at how intricate that meal is! that is how these people eat. What the hell would tony want with a legitimate army cook book?

       In the email chain that the Army cookbook is mentioned... 1) she asks if he received the book
      </p>
      <p>
       2) he confirms
      </p>
      <p>
       3) she lists one hell of a nice meal plan, in a pizza oven, with a "block" of Icecream.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) these rich fucks eat like kings, not like what someone would make from an army cookbook. " Mixed grill of Tandoori chicken, lamb, and Lahori fish: Pizza oven. Garnished with ribbon onions in lemon mint chutney. Garlic Naan ( freshly baked, pizza oven @ 550 degrees) Greek Yoghurt with shredded cucumber and fresh corriander garnish. . Basmati rice Pilaff with fresh green peas, Saffron and roasted pine nuts garnish."
      </p>
      <p>
       5) what the hell does Tony want with an Army cook book? I suspect the book to be the cypher for whatever code they have been using in the email exchanges.

      <p>
       It's been fairly common knowledge since before the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       its always been marketed as
       <em>
        Michael Aquino's Temple of Set®
       </em>
       - as a direct competitor to Anton LaVey's
       <em>
        Temple of Satan®
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       A guy like Aquino is actually someone that makes you wonder if theres anything to the allegations or if actually just a market strategy to lure "evil" people with big wallets into Tos memberships.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whats more evil than having satanic orgies with kids - "f u Anton, whos more evil now!"

       Yes. Google church of set, click the first link which is Wikipedia, look to the right and you can see who/when founded it

        not sure if serious...but yes I realize that's the official story. The question is do we really know that? How?

          Maybe it's posted on instagram.  /u/Contrary_mma_hipster  forgets that these people are arrogant and don't consider what they post or where they post.  Why would they give a fuck about wikipedia when it's plastered all over their instagrams.

           Because the Aquino case already happened and the story is sanitized, obviously.

          ALL reporting done at the time of the case breaking, testimonies, court docs...Wikipedia is fine for the official story but anything like this will have a coverup.

       Yes.  Aquino founded the Church of Set.  In fact, he's a RECOGNIZED Army chaplain!  Can you believe that?  Get wounded in battle, and a chaplain walks up to you...and what?  Eats you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see how this tie-in is true though.  Just because someone displays 14 and a fish doesn't mean he follows Set, and I certainly don't see a connection to Aquino just from this.  The OP really should have qualified his post...it's misleading.

        Does 14 fish have any other meanings.  He drew them on his hands and posed for a picture like that so it has to mean something.

         Well, I did't watch the whole thing because the dude has issue with getting to the point, but supposedly he is someone who has researched the occult symbology and he put out a 10 minute video that explains (I think) what Podesta was saying--it wasn't good, that's fer sure...

     Also interesting that Aquino's background was military intelligence, psychological warfare, and political science.

     Sounds awfully similar to the stuff going on with Soros.

      If you want real answers look up Carolyn Hamlet. She was an ex illuminati mind control victim who got out. She seems credible. She has a blog called beyond the physical realm.

       Eh. Checked her stuff out. Lots of hyper Christian rhetoric. That's all fine and well I guess, but she offers a profound lack of any specifics about anything she's talking about, which is a pretty big red flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll continue checking out her stuff for a bit - she definitely knows her Biblical passages and some deeper theological ideas, but she's produced a lot of material and after a quick scan, I'm just not seeing the level of detail that's been showing up in some of the better source materials.
      </p>
      <p>
       She mentions stuff like underground bunkers, hybrid people, aliens, and all sorts of whacky stuff... which is fine, but she then offers no detailed evidence to back it up... instead she switches gears into bible passage reading, elaborate analogies, and dire warnings. I guess I just wish she had some facts to back up here theories.

        The thing is that when ritualistic Satanic sex is done on kids it fragments the mind. From there the government can program different alters to perform different tasks. Sometimes the individual is not even aware of those sleeping alters until they are triggered. I know is some crazy crazy stuff but it aligns with others testimonies and scripture. What you have to keep in mind is just as we have a physical intellect there is also a spiritual one. Sort of like the five modalities for learning. This is the biggest pill you ever gonna swallow. I still have a hard time believing but it does make sense in a spiritual way. In the end is not so much what we believe but what satanist/ Luciferians believe. This pill is like the theory of everything. It connects it all.

         I'm not saying they don't do this mind control/conditioning stuff,  but the MKULTRA Monarch (super soldier,  Cathy Obrien etc. ) is really over blown and was created to hide the real reasons MKULTRA was deployed and what it was really about.  Not giving you a hard time but the monarch stuff is somewhat of a red herring,  and there's never much proof.  They is the  Ewen Cameron stuff which is legit,  and a woman from Vermont whoa name escapes me.  Colin Ross is another good source on the CIA MKULTRA stuff.  http://www.gnosticmedia.com/category/articles/

      Aquino co wrote a paper on psychological warfare that is erily aplropo these days.   He is one of the architects of modern electronic warfare,  the kind they deploy domestically. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/mindwar-michael-aquino.pdf&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf3ZP5_6jQAhXhqVQKHXnAAyYQFggcMAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGMQPSWM0oZCuqvty2vF0dNwi7lDw&amp;sig2=CdZOzrakg00OO0Ns-R9Dgg

    This is a huge important link that's been established. Aquino was accused in a scandle on an daycare on a california base (Presidio). It has zero coverage online with the exception of the new york times article that broke it.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/16/us/army-will-close-child-care-center.html
   </p>
   <p>
    There were 4 children who had STDs and despite never formalling introduces to Acquino, described him and his home in great detail and were correct. This case sparked off the "Satanic Panic" and suddenly all resources started going into investigating the McMartin preschool trial, which was a clearly false case.
   </p>
   <p>
    While the Satanic Panic was going on everyone forgot about  Presidio daycare. The case was dropped because the judge in the case ruled the children were too traumatized to be reliable witnesses to their own abuses.
   </p>
   <p>
    People have made accusations about Aquino since, but nothing more than accusations. Everything from plosible theories to crazy tinfoil. Link Podesta to Pedophilia and using cooking metophores and you have gone one visible link higher in this crazy circle.
   </p>
   <p>
    The theory is Acquino sets up these rings to control pedophiles and use ritual for them to control their victims. Pedophiles on average have higher IQs, so it could be very valuble to have a way to control successful powerful pedophiles. It starts going into tinfoil after that, but this link should not be ignored

      just conjecture here but I know it's commonly believed that psychopaths are of above average intelligence. I feel psychopathy is not unrelated from pedophilia.

     Or maybe Aquino is a guy that makes pretty big bucks selling satanic internet religion to insecure pedophiles in search of a meaning to their "affliction", and maybe the best way to market a satanic church is by having an image of being led by a bigbadassmofo of a childabusing devilworshipping, secret serviced hell-of-a-guy? Of course he doesn't
     <em>
      have
     </em>
     to be a fake, just because he has a money motive, but somehow lying to people to make lots of money just somehow seems more likely than organized satanic childabuse and ancient demons on speed dial.
    </p>

     Kinda like we've seen it all before with this aleister guy a hundred years ago

      Hard to say. Aquino is slick, I say that as a compliment and with minor contempt. What ever it is he does, he does very well and is very successful. It's hard to say. I don't want to leap to conclusions. There is a chance it is all 100% pure coincident.

      I am letting evidence lead me...

       Or maybe thats just an outward image? The guy just seems so untrustworthy that i can't help think that he's just a very effective bullshitter, but then again "Psychological Warfare Specialis" might be a eufemism for just that.
       <br/>
       The guy even claims to be a scottish laird http://imgur.com/a/CVNaA
      </p>
      <p>
       He just seems a little too much over the top - like he's the emperor of neckbeards, and well the eyebrows seem to support that theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: And then being the owner of a satanic church, he might actually be one of the few people in the world that gains from having an image of maybe/maybe-not being a child-molester. Since i guess when attracting (paying) members to satanism you might wanna look as bad/evil as possible.

        I would bet my left nut that Aquino is involved in a pedophile ring. He, and Marina Avramobic must be the two big shots. Their perfected art is to hide in plain sight.

         They might be - but i don't really consider the lack of media coverage on an incident except for an article from the nytimes as "evidence" in this matter.
         <br/>
         Is there any real evidence against this guy, that isn't just internet conjecture? Its just that allegations of child-abuse are pretty serious business and somehow that just requires a little more extraordinary evidence than just "he probably is"

      This entire thread you've dodged the question on the Army Cookbook.  Why did you highlight it?  Why is this even a focus?  Even if he did send a book to someone else, it could have been altered in ways that would be unable to be proven unless you found that specific copy.  Why did you highlight the Army Cookbook reference?  I highly doubt that there is something of substance in something called the Army Cookbook, and readily available on Google.

       It's possible the book is a tool for translating their code, in other words they may be using the book as a cipher.

     Dietrich is a intel stooge,  he was outed by Jan Irvin recently.  Jan and Hans Utter,  and Steve Outtrim in another series,  broke open more info on silicon Valley,  Aquino, burning man and elite CIA satanism.   This isn't tin foil hats stuff,  it's legit MKUltra research with primaries to back if up. www.gnostic media.com

    "Back in 1984, Giuliani was U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.  During that time, allegations began to surface about physical and sexual abuse perpetrated on children at the day care center at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.  The allegations were addressed by West Point officials in a significant manner after a 3 year old girl was seen by a military physician for a lacerated vagina.  With two of the alleged abusers being civilian workers at the day care, the matter was turned over to the FBI to investigate, and Giuliani was in charge of the case.  After Giuliani failed to indict any one for the abuse, some of the parents filed a civil suit and were eventually awarded $2.7 million from the government in 1991.  The Times Herald Record, the local paper, covered the allegations, but the story was picked up nationally after Giuliani failed to indict anyone.  The Washington Post ran a story on how one of the fathers refused promotion over anger that no criminal charges were filed and it seemed like more interest was put towards protecting West Point's image than protecting children or justice."

     Funny, we think about this completely differently.
    </p>
    <p>
     I've been digging for so many hours, I've seen so much heartbreaking shit and I want it to stop. Too much surrounds John to discredit this. Rather, it makes me think bigger.
    </p>
    <p>
     Who made #14 about the oceans, and thus, would lead to 14 + fish? Why wasn't #10 about the oceans?
    </p>
    <p>
     This pedophile ring is GLOBAL. It encompasses the elites everywhere. It includes Obama (I'll upload soon).
    </p>
    <p>
     I think whomever designated #14 to pertain to the oceans is definitely involved.

    the connection seems pretty weak. the 14 and fish connection makes sense, but the other connections don't make sense.
   </p>
   <p>
    "army cook book" is hardly enough to link him to the army guy and the temple of set. honestly, this image would seem stronger if you just excluded the army cook book email and instead just showed Aquino/Temple of Set stuff along with Podesta seemingly expressing knowledge of Set. - this would just simply strengthen that this type of stuff exists within our government.

    I dunno this is pretty vague - so you are conneting the Army cookbook with someone in the army - but no proof they know each other?  keep digging

    You guys need to use a different image hosting source, imgur is blocking links when i try to send them in certain programs. I recommend sli.mg, but thats up to you all as a community.

    please tone down titles like this until there are hard connections between the links you suggest, which are very weak.
