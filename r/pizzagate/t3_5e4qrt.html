        <p><p>As we all know mainstream media is suppressing this with everything they've got. There is so much evidence tying these people together doing awful things to children and it's too much to ignore. </p>
<p>If you have a favorite YouTube video producer, suggest and urge them to look into this and to let their fans know the atrocities that are happening to our children. </p>
<p>This is spreading more and more every day but their influence would have a lot more reach. </p>
<p>Thank you all, for digging into this horrible mess. It's uncomfortable and terrible but it's there and we need to expose it. Keep it up, godspeed.</p></p>
