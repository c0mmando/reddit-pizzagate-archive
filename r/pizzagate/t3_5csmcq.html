<p><p>Thanks for the heads up. It is a bit chaotic among the mods, but I'll try and get this stickied and keep this comment thread visible at the top for some transparency/something to hold the mods to until we can figure out what's going on. We need to organise ourselves a lot better. I'll keep you updated on what I hear back by commenting here again when I do hear something.</p></p>

<p><p>I've stickied the post at the top for visibility, also messaged the rest of the mods on their thoughts about how we can organise ourselves and communicate well for clarity. Maybe something like a group chat we can constantly update the sub on daily/weekly/something like that. As per, we'll keep you updated as we hear back.  If you guys have any ideas feel more than free to let us know either through replies to comments or just message the mods directly to send something we'll all see. We can't do this alone, we need help from all you guys. We all help each other keep this sub and this movement moving.<br/>
In regards to some posts being deleted, I know that some posts get deleted for being spammed multiple times, some get deleted for sensationalist titles that implicate specific people involved without evidence/enough evidence to suggest so and just to stay safe they're deleted to avoid witch hunts. (we've had a few people message the mods threatening to sue etc because they claim to be x or y as implicated in x or y post; some are fake/shills trying to scare us, but some are genuine, so to avoid that all together we encourage anyone digging to make sure the evidence speaks for itself before posting it and claiming anything on top. Or alternatively, tag your post as [speculation] or something to a similar extent to avoid any legal issues, because they are a genuine worry).<br/>
I, personally, haven't seen every single post that's been deleted so I can't speak for everyone, but I've seen a few that match with those kinds of criteria, so yeah I guess we'll just try to stay on top of it as things keep going. And we'll try and keep you updated, stay transparent with you. Thanks a lot guys. Your input is what helps and what we need to hear to do the best we can. </p></p>

<p>I just simply get that the UK says to know who did it, but won't tell.  I was thinking maybe an American reference would come up, if it did - I missed it.  Maybe I watched the video from the wrong perspective.  I stumbled over here linked from another sub. </p></p>

<p><p>Interesting that the email was to Herbert &amp; Marion Sandler, the co-CEOs that destroyed the US economy with the 2008 mortgage crisis. In 2006, they sold World Savings Bank, poisoned with one of the largest bad mortgage portolios in the US, to Wachovia, one of the top 4 banks who, among others, failed after acquiring a large portfolio of bad mortgages.</p>
<p>The Sandlers have very close connections to Soros.</p></p>

<p><p>Good question, and yest. There are emails from 2006, so he definitely had it before 2007. It's just that there is a mysterious absence of emails from the relevant time period. Either Wikileaks intentionally held back from revealing those emails (saving them for insurance?) or Podesta was inactive during that time or Podesta deleted the emails from that time. Any of these cry out for an explanation. </p></p>

<p><p>I am completely in the dark about "Police renderings" but how often are they actually used as a basis for probable cause to move the investigation further?  I agree that this is suspicious, but with the sheer number of children we are talking about here, why are we so focused on this one instance?  Maybe I am tired of seeing this same info over and over again without any real headway, but I highly doubt you can claim there was probable cause with the evidence provided in this infographic.  Keep digging guys, there are people on the fringes of this ring that were not nearly as careful as Podesta and the sheer volume of weird associations is in itself damning!  </p></p>

<p><p>Here's my take on this... It's far too uncanny a resemblance to be coincidence.</p>
<p>Local police know who is responsible but are getting blocked by superiors. Therefore they publish this identikit of the 'person of interest' so that at some point in the future investigators will put two and two together.</p></p>

<p><p>You are suggesting it was Freud himself?</p>
<p>Interesting, they touch on how Freud looked to cook elaborate meals for his victims before abusing them.</p>
<p>Obviously the Podestas pride themselves on their cooking.</p>
<p>Is there some occult practise based around food and sexual acts?</p></p>

<p><p>It is a coincidence. The two sketches were of a single person: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/madeleine-mccann-latest-are-police-any-closer-to-knowing-the-tru/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mary and Martin Smith, from Ireland, told police they saw a man carrying a child matching Madeleine’s description at around 10pm on Rua da Escola Primaria, 500 yards from the McCanns’ apartment. He was heading towards the beach, did not look like a tourist and did not seem comfortable carrying the child, they said.</p>
<p>Their evidence was compelling, but it was only in October 2013 that two e-fit images of the man, compiled by police from descriptions given by Mr and Mrs Smith, were released by Scotland Yard to coincide with a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction of Madeleine’s disappearance. He remains a suspect.</p>

<p><p>You're dreaming if you believe that narrative.</p>
<p>These images were created in 2013, what's that 6 years after she went missing?</p>
<p>There's no way that anyone involved believed it to be a useful depiction of a man someone saw walking on a beach 6 years earlier.</p></p>

<p><p>I don't give a damn about narratives. I care about facts. Do you have any evidence to show that the police sketches were of two different people? Telling me I'm gullible or a liar isn't evidence; it's evidence of someone with irrational thinking.</p>
<p>I might add that your apparent hypothesis is that the police put out these sketches years afterward that were actually of the Podestas, and they're still up, but in order to hide the fact that it was the Podestas they just claimed it was a single person rather than take the pictures off their website? That's pretty farfetched considering how quickly others are taking things down, such as on Instagram and Archive.</p></p>

<p><p>If I were on a jury I'd throw that e fit out as evidence due to the time span between when it happened and when it was generated.</p>
<p>One thing we know for a fact is that with regards to the Clinton and Podesta group, there are insiders in law enforcement who are leaking information because they are being blocked by superiors.</p>
<p>Given the visual similarity to the Podestas, the Podesta's relationships with known paedos, the deleted emails, the nature of this town as a paedo resort, the Podesta's known to vacation in Portugal... Given all that I'm much more inclined to believe this is leaked information than a 6 year old memory.</p></p>

<p><p>From what I know, eye witness accounts are often very flawed, and police sketches can be unreliable (it's better to show a bunch of faces and have them pick the one that looks most similar, and keep repeating until they get a face that they think is right).  However, many sketches have been accurate.  </p>
<p>My opinion is that there's no real way to tell.  Who was the witness, and how good of a look did they get of the criminals?</p></p>

<p><p>I don't know about this. I think it's a huge stretch compared to everything else being investigated on this sub.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of children go missing every year. Of all the cases to focus on and compare photos, what's been chosen is possibly <em>the most famous case of a missing child in the last 20 years</em>. What are the chances of that case being involved with what is being uncovered right now?</p>
<p>Why would these two possible abduct her on their own and risk being identified or caught? These are two very rich men, who have never slipped up anywhere else, it just seems stupid.</p>
<p>It's already been established that the podestas travel <em>all the time</em>, so it's really not that much of a coincidence that one of them was away at the time.</p>
<p>So the only thing you've got to go on is that one sketch vaguely resembles Tony, and the other.. only connection I can see is that he's fat, looks totally different in every other aspect.</p>
<p>I think you're clutching at straws here guys. Also, what do you mean sufficient explanation? Explanation of what, from who?</p></p>

<p><p>You're hypothesising doesn't line up with the origin of those sketches. These sketches are two different descriptions of the same person. I know police think there were more people involved, but that's irrelevant to these sketches given by the witnesses. They were given of the same person they both witnessed (I've seen you just ignoring this elsewhere in the thread so I don't expect a very intelligent reply on this point). You can't have it both ways.</p>
<p>1 sketch looks like tony, the other just looks like a fat guy. Tony/John are always travelling and there are many, many other cases of unanswered/deleted emails in the leaks. The rest of your string of "coincidentally" comments are 100% unrelated to Madeline McCann and irrelevant to my point.</p>
<p>The case was high profile because of the media reaction to it, and the strange circumstances in which it occurred. What are you suggesting, the police forced the media to cover it because they knew the perpetrator was high profile and they wanted the world to find out about it?! That makes no sense.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm not preventing anyone from investigating it, nor am I attempting to.</p>
<p>I'm free to be sceptical of something I see as bullshit and clutching on straws. Compared to the rest of this sub, this picture is fucking laughable to me.</p>
<p>If there weren't people like me calling bullshit, this place would turn into an echo chamber. Just look at OP's replies to some of the comments, particularly regarding the origin of the sketches. He wants to believe and is ignoring/sidestepping evidence that is contrary to his confirmation bias.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm going to make one more attempt to make this as basic as I can for you and then I'm washing my hands of it.</p>
<p><strong>Point 1:</strong> The <a href="http://i.imgur.com/LA4h0TF.jpg">two police sketches</a> in question were made from descriptions given by an Irish couple by the names of Martin and Mary Smith.  This is a documented fact that I am completely unable to find disputed <em>anywhere</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Point 2:</strong>  The Smiths' story is well documented in the press and on the web.  <a href="http://www.thesun.ie/irishsol/homepage/5199791/We-saw-him-carrying-girl-like-Maddie-down-empty-side-street.html">Example 1.</a> <a href="http://www.mccannpjfiles.co.uk/PJ/MARTIN_SMITH.htm">Example 2.</a> <a href="http://thesmithsighting.blogspot.com/">Example 3.</a></p>
<p><strong>Point 3:</strong> The Smiths only ever described seeing <strong>ONE PERSON</strong> that seemed suspicious to them.  This is what they told police, and it is this <strong>ONE PERSON</strong> that formed the basis of <em>these particular police sketches</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Point 4:</strong>  Whether or not there are multiple suspects is immaterial to the solid, indisputable fact that these two pictures were generated from the witnessing of ONE INDIVIDUAL by two witnesses who were together at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> These two police sketches <em>cannot possibly</em> be renderings of both of the Podesta brothers.</p></p>

<p><p>Are you serious?  As soon as I saw your 'point 2' I new the whole post was complete bs.  The McCanns hired a high-level PR firm to <em>control</em> what the press wrote.  And there was some people in top levels of gov't that did not want any real facts of this case to come out.</p>
<p>The end result is that anyone with half-a-brain <em>knows</em> that the story the press has been feeding the populace about the McCann kidnapping is completely false.  Stop shilling.  You're not dealing with fools or naive people around here.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to understand what the real facts are of the McCann case, do a web search on Richard D Hall/richplanet.net.</p></p>

<p><p>Listen snowflake, and try again. I know you're not used to using logic and observation skills and or putting anything more difficult than your shattered spirit together...but the drawings ARE of John Podesta and his brother Tony, right down to the mole on Tony. There is quite literally nothing that you can say or do to convince people that the drawing of the skinny guy and the drawing of the fat man are the same damn person.</p>

<p><p>You haven't proven that the two pictures are of two people yet. I have asked you to do so multiple times and you have refused. You are literally doing nothing but distracting a serious investigation because you can't get it through your head that the police sketches are of ONE person, and the Podestas are NOT one person.</p></p>

<p><p>It's protecting it's own narrative...and detective work. Some stupid people have literally spent their entire lives trying to prove the McCanns killed Maddy. Point...in a way they did...they allowed Freud to become friends with them.</p>

<p><p>So, what you're saying is that Martin and Mary Smith saw <em>as many as six people</em>, but they imagined that it was only one man, but still somehow managed to create sketches of two different people despite believing that they had only seen one man?  And this somehow wasn't discovered until nearly 10 years after the fact by some dumbass on reddit whose only evidence is the use of the sketches in an article about cell phone tracking?</p>
<p>That's incredible. </p></p>

<p><p>The sentence before that adds context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based or more recent information, <strong>the Metropolitan Police now believe this man may represent a guest at the Ocean Club who was carrying his daughter back to their apartment</strong>. However as it is not possible to be certain that these two men are actually the same person</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The man they are referring to is this man:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann#Tanner_sighting">
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann#Tanner_sighting</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although Tanner had not seen the man's face, the sighting became important because it offered investigators a time frame for the abduction, but Scotland Yard came to view it as a red herring.[50] In October 2013 they said that a British holidaymaker had been identified as the man Tanner had seen, and that he had been returning to his apartment after collecting his daughter from the Ocean Club night creche.[51][52] Scotland Yard took photographs of the man wearing the same or similar clothes to the ones he was wearing on the night, and standing in a pose similar to the one Tanner reported. The pyjamas his daughter had been wearing also matched Tanner's report. Scotland Yard said they were "almost certain" the Tanner sighting was not related to the abduction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What your link is saying is that the police don't know if the man that Jane Tanner saw is the same person that the Smiths saw.</p></p>

<p><p>It literally says "it is not possible to be certain that these two men are actually the same person".  Huh, if they are 2 different people, how could they look so similar?  I wonder.....</p>
<p>P.S. Not saying that I KNOW it is 2 people.  We are hear to follow leads and this one still seems plausible.</p></p>

<p><p>Nice selective editing.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>They weren't saying there was two suspects. They're saying that someone who was a guest may have resembled the guy in the police sketches. You are now willfully censoring what you find and are doing so in order to create the appearance of evidence to your as-yet-unproven claim that these pictures are of two different people. I now propose that you are a shill and you are here to derail this entire investigation with this ridiculous red herring.</p></p>

<p><p>That's not what he asked.  </p>
<p>What he's talking about is that those two police sketches are of the same individual as described by Martin and Mary Smith who saw a man carrying a child in the area.  Why they are so different, I don't know.</p></p>

<p><p>Look at the links and verify. That specific factor is addressed. The two sketches were initially believed to be based on two witness descriptions of one suspect. But as the investigation continued it was then two suspects, and the most recent count is up to six. This is all in the links I included.</p></p>

<p><p>Listen.  </p>
<p>AT THE TIME the sketches were made, they were of only one individual witnessed by two people at the same time.</p>
<p>AT THE TIME, there was only one suspect not six.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter that there are six now unless you are suggesting that the couple simultaneously witnessed multiple people but thought they only saw one. If you are saying that, then stop drinking the Kool-Aid.</p></p>

<p><p>No one is denying that there are multiple suspects!  We are saying that those two sketches are renderings of the same person!  This can be verified on nearly every webpage that contains those pictures, and no one ever claimed that they were two different people until the image in your OP started making the rounds a couple of days ago.</p></p>

<p><p>Here is an article about the couple who provided the descriptions for these sketches:</p>
<p><a href="http://thesmithsighting.blogspot.com/">http://thesmithsighting.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>AN Irish family holidaying in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz on the night Madeleine McCann went missing say they will "fully cooperate" with any new police probe.</p>
<p>Louth couple Martin and Mary Smith were quizzed by investigators after they claimed to have seen a man carrying a young child through the town on the night of the May 3, 2007. </p>
<p>Madeleine was almost four years old when she vanished from her bed in her parents' apartment at the Ocean Club holiday resort in Praia da Luz between 9.35pm and 10pm on May 3, 2007. </p>
<p>Despite a massive police investigation and huge publicity worldwide, she has not been found. However it has now emerged that a group of Portuguese detectives have been appointed to carry out a fresh review of the investigation. </p>
<p>Now, the Irish couple who were interviewed by police following the girl's disappearance are bracing themselves to be reinterviewed. </p>
<p>Reports in British newspapers have claimed Scotland Yard officers will approach the Smith family in the coming weeks as they attempt to construct a photofit on the prime suspect. </p>

<p><p>Hey. What happened to 'post once' and then get out of here?  No one is interested in your lies about the McCann case.  The whole investigation on the British end was a farce.  If anyone is interested in the REAL truth, go to youtube and search on richard d hall mccann. He has an in-depth analysis of the crime and the investigation that PROVES everything the press said is a lie.</p></p>

<p><p>Yes, it is two pictures of the same guy. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/madeleine-mccann-latest-are-police-any-closer-to-knowing-the-tru/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mary and Martin Smith, from Ireland, told police they saw a man carrying a child matching Madeleine’s description at around 10pm on Rua da Escola Primaria, 500 yards from the McCanns’ apartment. He was heading towards the beach, did not look like a tourist and did not seem comfortable carrying the child, they said.</p>
<p>Their evidence was compelling, but it was only in October 2013 that two e-fit images of the man, compiled by police from descriptions given by Mr and Mrs Smith, were released by Scotland Yard to coincide with a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction of Madeleine’s disappearance. He remains a suspect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have posed this fact to OP multiple times now and they don't address it. They only post other articles saying that there were actually multiple suspects. I don't dispute that fact, but the fact remains that the sketches in question are only found to be described as depicting a single person. John Podesta and Tony Podesta cannot be a single person.</p>
<p>Again, this doesn't mean I don't think there's teeth to Pizzagate. It's simply that these police sketches are not of the Podestas, according to the only records out there. I welcome anyone who can provide a citation of the pictures as being of two people.</p></p>

<p><p>I REALLY want to believe this, but I'm having a hard time. Why would John and Tony do the kidnapping themselves? Surly they're in a position where they can have people do it for them? And it would be wayy too risky just kidnapping an American girl. Idk I mean, the evidence all fits together and makes sense, but i just can't really digest this as 100% proof</p></p>

<p><p>This! I truly and wholeheartedly believe in everything that is being discovered - so in no way am I one of the skeptical people. But this one particular thing just makes no sense to me.... why on earth would they kidnap her themselves.....? Surely they wouldn't risk something like that....? I mean, I dont know... it's possible.... but out of all of this bizarre shit - this is the one and only thing that makes no sense logically to me</p></p>

<p><p>I think proving this definitively is something that cannot be done with internet resources alone. Either someone with new information has to spill it, or someone with more official resource access can confirm the travel of both individuals for those dates.</p></p>

<p><p>The police sketches aren't of two people. There is only one suspect. Those sketches are of the SAME suspect, as relayed by two different witnesses. </p>
<p>It's so incredibly sloppy that thousands of people have accused "the brothers," both of them, without taking the time to notice that every single source says the sketches are both of a single suspect. </p></p>

<p><p>Wrong. There are as many as six suspects now, according to the most recent reports. The notion that "there is only one suspect" is based on outdated information.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm glad you guys are doing this, and you need to keep digging...but the police sketches were two accounts of a single man that was seen: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/madeleine-mccann-latest-are-police-any-closer-to-knowing-the-tru/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mary and Martin Smith, from Ireland, told police they saw a man carrying a child matching Madeleine’s description at around 10pm on Rua da Escola Primaria, 500 yards from the McCanns’ apartment. He was heading towards the beach, did not look like a tourist and did not seem comfortable carrying the child, they said.</p>
<p>Their evidence was compelling, but it was only in October 2013 that two e-fit images of the man, compiled by police from descriptions given by Mr and Mrs Smith, were released by Scotland Yard to coincide with a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction of Madeleine’s disappearance. He remains a suspect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Singular, folks. It's just a coincidence. It blew my mind so much I had to double check.</p>
<p>I've already posted this in one of the deleted posts about this. In that thread, the OP, FilmPolice, posted a link and told me I was wrong. He didn't explain how, and the link he posted only confirmed that there were multiple suspects. Again: the link above is proof that the police sketches were of a single person. If FilmPolice cannot provide evidence that the sketches were originally of two people, this is a dead end and we need to stop wasting time and resources(as well as visibility) on something so easily debunked.</p></p>

<p><p>I would just like to remind people that on Twitter you can not be down voted into oblivion by moronic pedo protecting Hillbots, and there are no pedo loving mods who can simply delete feeds.</p>
<p>Also, there is an active thread about the DC pedophile ring and "Pizzagate" on a forum called "AboveTopSecret", may be a good idea to sign up there and post to preserve your work. Your posts (or new threads about Pizzagate) will not be removed there (no down voting possible either!) as long as you are reasonable polite and don't act like a complete asshat to other members. </p>
<p>http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1145469/pg1</p>
<p>I also love all you guys/girls who are working so hard to uncover the horrible crimes committed against children. I am not as techno clever and good at web sleuthing as most of you are, but I follow your great efforts and will contribute as best I can if I find useful information. Respect and kudos to you. </p></p>

<p><p>Keep in mind when these pictures were 1st posted,  twitter was hit with a DDOS, and CTR descended upon r/the_donald in an attempt to flood the post away.  Reddit search was also censoring the search for "Madeleine McCann".  The two biggest threads were not visible when searched.  And I see shills comtinue to say this is supposed to be one suspect.  Whatever.  Like the OP has mentioned at least half a dozen times, there are multiple suspects.  The one suspect theory is old and outdated.</p></p>

<p><p>There is a lot more evidence that is not mentioned in the meme. The most significant is that T. Podesta pays hundreds of thousands to celebrate artistic depictions of child abduction, and is good friends with a convicted child molester. And J. Podesta has the nonsensical references to "pizza" along with "xoxo" from the owner of Comet Pizza. </p></p>

<p>None of what you just said relates to Maddy.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm disputing <strong>only the McCann Link</strong>, nothing else, dumbass.</p>
<p>Why not just blame the Podestas for all child abductions in the last 10 years while you're at it? Because they haven't got a contextless sketch of someone that vaguely resembles 1/2 of people accused.
Have you checked those images against other known pedophiles, or just the Podestas?</p>
<p>You have next to no evidence to go on, and this post will make everyone laugh at this sub. One could even suspect you are the shill for trying to poison the credibility of the shit that gets posted here. Honestly that's how ridiculous you're acting. You are filled with confirmation bias and are seeing what you want to. You've refused to listen to the voice of reason multiple times in this thread so I'm done with it.</p>
<p>I'm happy just sitting back and reading about this conspiracy rather than participating. But seeing people spout stupid shit like this, I just had to say something and point out the many flaws (which you conveniently sidestepped around all over this thread, because these facts go against what you <em>want</em> to believe). This theory is ridiculous and has nothing to go on compared to the rest of pizzagate.</p></p>

<p><p>Can you elaborate on the last sentence? I'm sorry but I don't know what's inherently suspicious about the owner of a pizza place talking to podesta about pizza lol</p></p>

<p><p>I have only seen a picture of a girl sitting next to the Podestas in a group meeting that doesn't resemble her much. I don't believe I've seen the picture you've described, though I'm trying to find it now. If anyone could link it here that'd be appreciated.</p></p>

<p><p>Nope. Everybody still agrees it's an open case. "beyond stupid" is not an answer. </p></p>
