        <strong>Proof that Bill Clinton was in London on May 2007 meeting with Sheik Mohammed of Saudi Arabia. Could Podesta have been in his entourage?</strong>

<p>"YOU met the Sheik in London in May, 2007, at which time the Agreement was signed and the first $2 million check was received."</p>
<p>*Madeleine McCann disappeared on May 3rd 2007 in Portugal.  To those new to this sub Madeleine Mccann was one of the most high profile abduction cases in Europe.  The men who were identified as her abductors look IDENTICAL to John and Tony Podesta.  </p>
<p>What I am hypothesizing is that the Podesta's entered Europe under diplomatic cover, on Bill Clinton's plane and then made a quick jaunt to Portugal.  If we can confirm that Bill Clinton was in the UK on or before May 3rd to meet with the Sheik, then the plot thickens.  </p>
<p>Here is a link to the article detailing McCann's abductors (The Podestas):  </p>

        <p><p>Another user has pointed out that Bill Clinton was in London on May 11th, so I don't think my theory would work.  </p>
<p>Let's keep looking for evidence tying the Podesta's to a European travel during the first week of May 2007.  </p>

        <p><p>Here is a direct link to the attachment itself.  The question we need to find out is:  was Bill Clinton in London on May 3rd the day Madeleine McCann disappeared?  If so, the Podesta's could have entered the UK under diplomatic cover and hid their entry into Europe, providing them with the chance to go to Portugal undetected.  </p>
