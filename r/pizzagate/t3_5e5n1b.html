        <strong>Pizzagate hit TOP7 Polish website. I translated the article.</strong>
        <p><p>Please mind english is not my first language. You'll find many mistakes. I tried to keep original context.</p>
<p><strong>If you don't count google, youtube, facebook and polish ebay clone, wp.pl is really a top2 website in Poland.</strong></p>
<p>tl;dr; another conspiracy theory</p>
<h1>Pizzagate. Weird conspiracy theory is getting out of control</h1>
<ul>
<li>Conspiracy theory related to Hillary Clinton team gets bigger</li>
<li>Users claim Clinton team role in pedofile ring</li>
<li>The main source is website well known for hoaxes </li>
</ul>
<p>Allocated in Washington suburbs pizzeria Comet Ping Pong doesn't look any different from similar restaurants in american capital. But according to hundreds of anonymous internet users this place is centre of pedofile ring, even occult ring that is connected with washington elites and Hillary Clinton campaign. "Pizzagate" is getting bigger and slowly gets into mainstream - even when whole "affair" is based on series of not exactly consistent traces and speculations.</p>
<p>Whole thing started on forum that is well known from trolling, 4chan, which users, in past, were creators of complicated hoaxes that media followed (got fooled/baited). In this case reddit also joined investigation together with conspiracy blogs, ufo blogs and "fake news" blogs. The main person of speculation is James Alefantis, owner of the pizzeria, whose life partner, David Bronck is former journalist (also former author of Bill Clinton sexual scandal articles) and today a president of fundation connected with Democratic Party. John Podesta's Wikileaks emails revealed that Alefantis store was used by Hillary campaign for fundraising and election meetings. Emails also revealed Alefantis and Podesta personal relations (but not sure how serious)</p>
<p>Source of Alefantis pedophile accustion are his photos on Instagram portal, where many of them shows small kids with parents (probably guests of his restaurant). Some of them - for example picture of kid with hands taped to desk - are quite exceptional, however not really  showing any pedophile relations. There is plenty of funny coincidences. One of the presumptive evidences is apparanetly a photo of men published by Alfentis (surrounded by two half-naked dudes) in t-shirt "J'aime I'Enfant" which in french means "I love child". However it's easy to check that "L'Enfant" is also restaurant located in Washington, which name comes from architect,  Pierre L'Enfant, the author of USA capital (architecal) project.</p>
<p>But there are other presumptive evidences, exactly as "true": some users found that in restaurant bathrooms you can find graffiti/art related to sexual acts, and restaurant guested controversive artists. Others found pedophile symbols (butterfly made from four hearts) in restaurant logo (ping pong  rackets)</p>
<p>What are evidences that people related to Clinton to have spot in this theory? There is none. Theory is based on same, often repeated emails with words related  to food and pizza. Users say that these words comes up too often and in unnatural context. "Pizza" is "little girl", "sause" is orgy, "pasta" is little boy. How can we know? From nowhere to be honest, becaause only source is anonymous user from 4chan who based his revelances on "source from FBI".</p>
<p>Another relationship that points cryminal activity of businessmen (Alefantis), Tony and John is common interest in modern art, especially controversial artist Marina Abramovic, some people consider her art  connected with Ocultysm. In addition theorists also connect death of anti child traffic activist in Haiti (she supposed to make critics about Clintons activity in their fundations working on haiti) and even well known british conspiracionist and ufologist in Warsaw.</p>
<p>Even whole thing/affair/gate have very weak foundation, it hits very good target, because informations about pedophile connections with politcal and business elite is nothing new. Only in Monday the police in Norway informed about new pedophile ring discovery with 51 members - businessmens, lawyers and politicians. In United Kingdom there is ongoing investigation  about similar ring within politics and parlament. In United States well known bilioner and philanthropist, Jeffrey Epstein was convicted for minors abuse.  Epstein was well known figure along new york elites and he had relations with Bill Clinton, Donal Trump and many other public figures.</p>
<p>Even that "Pizagate" was so far domain of niche websites and circles (especially related with "Alt rights" and Donald Trump supporters) in the internet, other serious media also mentioned it - classyfing it as non confirmed mistification. On twitter #pizzagate is trending. The very real consequences of conspiracy theory hit the anonymous/not known (so far) owner of restaurant, who is getting treats and fake reviews. But he says the biggest scandal is the fact of publishing private pictures of his kids on public forums.</p>
<p>"The most sick thing in all of this is the fact people steal photos of 5, 7, 8y old kids and they publish it on their forums/websites, using them like panws" - said Alefantis  to "Washington City Paper". </p>

        <p><p>It's like they want to make #pizzagate sound completely unrealistic, something like 'Those crazy Americans and their UFOs and conspiracy theories'. wp.pl is German owned anyway so that's the narrative they prolly have in German mainstream media too.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well, despite discounting it as a crazy conspiracy theory of the alt-right, the article will at least get more eyes on it, including the eyes of media/government skeptics in Poland.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The article conveniently leaves out the MANY proven connections between Clinton and James Alefantis (John Podesta, many DNC-related fundraisers/phone banking events held at Comet Ping Pong, shared ownership of Comet Ping Pong and many other restaurants in that block of Connecticut Ave., Hillary's photo op across the street at Politics &amp; Prose, and the pedophilia symbols used by at least two of these establishments [P&amp;P and Besta Pizza]). Hopefully the skeptics who come across this article will dig deeper and find these connections, as we have.</p>
<p>Thanks for translating this, OP.</p></p>

        <p><p>And everyone's leaving out these facts.</p>
<p>1) Convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein helped start the Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p>2) Convicted pedophile Dennis Hastert is still considered a close friend of John Podesta.</p>
<p>3) Bill Clinton ditched his secret service detail to fly on the Lolita Express numerous times</p>
<p>4) Hillary defended a pedophile by destroying his 12 year old victim and then laughed about it.</p>
<p>5) Anthony Weiner was one of the Clintons closest associates and is widely known as a pedophile.</p>
<p>Hillary has displayed at the very least <strong>EXTREME COMFORT</strong> with pedophilia, as she surrounds herself with it openly and plainly.  This small list is enough to get most people to at least think there is something here.  </p></p>
