        <strong>[Meta] Would a skeptic thread be allowed?</strong>
        <p><p>I have doubts about a lot of the evidence being passed around here, and I'd like to get some debate started on its validity. Would skeptic threads be welcome here?</p>
<p>My aim would not be to insult anyone or question their intentions, but to encourage healthy debate. A good investigation needs people to take the skeptic's side because cases grow stronger by withstanding challenges. Otherwise your left with an echo chamber with a predetermined conclusion.</p>
<p>I don't want to bother writing something up if it's just going to be deleted.</p>
<p>Thanks</p></p>

        <p><p>My opinion; yes skeptic minds definitely allowed. Ppl need to stay focused and challenged on the way they think. But please argue with reason and evidence that proof differently. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yes please. I personally think there is something going on here but holy shit they way people get labeled as shills when questioning anything is a little unsettling. For all we know these armchair investigators are compromising some huge sting operation inadvertently.</p></p>

        <p><p>when was the last time you EVER heard of a sting op that collected ANYONE of this caliber? </p>
<p>i cant think of ANY time, and i dont think this is the start of a big jailing of high officials. </p>
<p>if anything, this stuff IS known about, but is simply used for leverage against these officials so they can get a better political/financial deal in any situation they choose. they would NEVER reveal the info publically, because there goes the ammunition they have against the target pedo..........</p></p>

        <p><p>My point was just that everyone digging into this needs to consider maintaining a healthy amount of skepticism before taking everything as fact without any concrete evidence or resources to even launch a true investigation. The last time there was a crowd-sourced internet investigation I can remember (Boston bomber) people ended up with egg on their face and an innocent person got caught in the crossfire.</p></p>

        <p><p>my bad, i wasnt clear enough. i was mostly responding to this part of the comment</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>your comment just seemed a bit of a cop-out and a thought-stopper. my point was that its highly unlikely that a proper, lawful investigation is going on. at most its probably a private investigation who's information will be used for blackmail, not lawful prosecution......</p></p>

        <p><p>Definitely. I think this case is extremely interesting, but a lot of people from the "conspiracy theory" crowd are jumping to conclusions and tying in other conspiracies, which is of course fine for them to believe but often compeltely unsubstantiated, so I think trying to find some middle ground and draw conclutions based on the evidence we do have (If there even is conclusions to draw atm), and have people counter arguing the points or sources so that this case has some credibility and we don-t blow our load so to speak.</p></p>

        <p><p>Some of the comments ive seen have been skeptical about stuff, so i guess its not against the rules.</p>
<p>Theres been several mentions of pizza/pasta/hot dogs in the e-mails, and some of them seem like they could be genuinely talking about food, but some seems sketchy for sure.</p>
<p>r/conspiracy seems to have stuff regarding this as well, and some people seem skeptic, rightfully so. Nothing can be taken as face-value just becouse someone thinks there might be something shady somewhere. </p></p>

        <p><p>There should be a huge sifting process to find out what is real and what is garbage. Sounds like you can help with that process. Your help is definitely needed.</p>
<p>Just by the way you posed your question, I think you're welcome here and I'd expect some good dialogue.</p>
<p>If I see people are being treated unfairly or downvoted into oblivion for simply stating their opinion, ~~it'll be hard for me to continue helping~~ I will not continue to help.</p></p>

        <p><p>I hear what your saying. It crosses the line of things that seem to have clout. The Pizza Logo being changed in response to allegations of pedophilia, and the owners disturbing IG pictures. WHAT SANE ADULT TAPES A LITTLE GIRLS HANDS TO A TABLE</p>
<p>The allegations of the Podesta's to the kidnapping are leaning toward Hollywood thriller territory.
We need to focus the lens onto the objectively weird findings, and keep the tin-foilers dialed back unless they find credible evidence.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is your first post under this account. You've continued to say the same thing over and over again. I like healthy skepticism but you are just spamming.</p>
<p>If you played a slightly different tune every once in a while, you wouldn't be banned. Many others have thought that you sound like a bot (you're not) in your quick and templated dismissal of certain leads, for instance Tavistock.</p>
<p>For someone who claims to have read the FBIanon AMAs (at least you commented saying as such on a link that included FBIanon 1+2, you should know that Tavistock is relevant. And if it's not, you need to at least address things like FBIanon which make Tavistock relevant.</p></p>

        <p><p>Huh, really? Of all the things I've seen in this sub the Madeleine McCann sketches are one of the most convincing to me. Do you think those to be coincidences or do you think the witness was trying to frame them?</p></p>

        <p><p>Skepticism is always good. But don't toss out things until you can find an explanation as to why they don't have merit. Because given how broad this is starting to get, having everything that's relevant available and recorded means you can double-check them all.</p>
<p>I think the whole McCann thing is exceptionally weak and I don't see any way to really effectively confirm Podesta's whereabouts given that he deleted all of his e-mails for that time frame. He was seen in the United States on the 11th of May that year. Going further on that topic may be impossible without access to law enforcement resources or someone who knows him just spilling the beans.</p>
<p>The ones that are the most credible so far are the ones that just keep getting more detail and more credence added to them as this moves along. NOTHING about Comet Ping Pong or the circle of people around James Alefantis is so far causing me to doubt the validity of the claims around that establishment. Not everyone around him is implicated or likely to be complicit, but it's clear that he collects freaks and many of them raise obvious alarms. Especially given their behaviors in response to becoming aware of our efforts.</p>
<p>They are bizarre people and they are doing something illegal that's behind a very thin veil of coded wording/symbology. What that something is still isn't quite clear.</p></p>
