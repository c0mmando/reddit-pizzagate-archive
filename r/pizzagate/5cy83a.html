    Games for Boys - possible child porn site?
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>

    I know this is slightly off-topic, since it doesn't relate directly to pizzagate, but my son was playing a racing game on this site:
   </p>
   <p>
    www.gamesforboys.net
   </p>
   <p>
    When I looked at what he was playing, something caught my eye. Two of the games featured on the homepage have a thumbnail with a rabbit and one with two crossed tennis rackets in the shape of a butterfly. I learned from my research into pizzagate that these are similar to pedo symbols. The other thing that caught my attention is one of the sections on the nav bar - COOKING. It's totally out of place on a flash game site. Why would kids playing online games be interested in cooking? With all the food symbolism in this whole thing, it got me looking more into the site. I found this article on the site that is really sketchy:
   </p>
   <p>
    "Boys And Desserts" - http://www.gamesforboys.net/category/articles/boys-and-desserts
   </p>
   <p>
    Here are some of the more creepy lines in the article:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <p>
      "Boys and girls alike have a passion for dessert; starting with the very moment they taste the first sweet thing."
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      "All great restaurants have a mastermind behind the kitchen counter, and most of the time that person is man."
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      "What is the one thing no one ever turns down, and finally, what is that thing that children die for? Well, it all starts with a delicious, tasty dessert."
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      "And the more you cook the same dish, the more you realize it can taste different all the time. Every single time you try the same dish you can discover new aromas and tastes, and that is what makes it a unique experience. Or, you can try doing something else every time."
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      "Everything is there inside the computer, so many decorations, frostings, sauces, and icings to keep them busy for a lifetime."
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      "All kids have a sweet tooth, boys and girls alike, and if we channel this desire for desserts towards something that can be equally fun, as it is healthy and life preparing, then our mission is achieved. And the great master chefs of tomorrow will thank us that instead of buying them something nice, we took them by the hand, and showed them the interior of the kitchen."
     </p>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Very very strange article, especially on a kids game site. Starting to think desserts may be a euphemism for child porn as well. Hopefully this isn't too off-topic, but it would be interesting it there's a link to the pizza sites.
