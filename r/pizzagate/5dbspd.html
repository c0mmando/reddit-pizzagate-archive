    Deleted reviews on YELP for Besta Pizza
   </strong>
   <p>

   <p>
    So I had written a review a few weeks ago on YELP about potential pedophilia, and so did a number of others. Went back to check on it, and they wiped it all those reviews out with a notification of doing so for a "news report". Can someone link a news article to this? I can't seem to find it anywhere. This is what the notification said:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Active Cleanup Alert
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    This business recently made waves in the news, which often means that people come to this page to post their views on the news.
   </p>
   <p>
    While we don’t take a stand one way or the other when it comes to these news events, we do work to remove both positive and negative posts that appear to be motivated more by the news coverage itself than the reviewer’s personal consumer experience with the business.
   </p>
   <p>
    As a result, your posts to this page may be removed as part of our cleanup process beginning Wednesday, November 16, 2016, but you should feel free to post your thoughts about the recent media coverage for this business on Yelp Talk at any time.

     this is what happens when people read this kind of stuff. they get emotional and start posting pedo comments on yelp. then yelp shuts the page down to get rid of them. happens whenever a business is in the news. nothing uncommon.

    I wouldn't post or do anything that will alert them to this investigation. It's going to force them to cover their tracks and quite possibly blow the whole operation.

    Yelp is garbage. When a business lands in hot water, they start to scrub all bad reviews, even if previous to the drama.
