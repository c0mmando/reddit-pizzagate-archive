        <strong>We need to try and remain based!</strong>
        <p><p>I don't want this to be a post to discourage anyone - everybody on this sub is putting their all into this investigation.</p>
<p>Buuuuut, I do have a word of warning. Since the Podesta emails dried up it's been left to us to find our own links and clues, and this has resulted in a bit of an aimless frenzy at times. It seems every company or every person that has a link to the Clinton crowd in some way is being labelled as complicit. This isn't a healthy way to run things and won't do anything to help our credibility with a wider audience.</p>
<p>Washington, DC is a small place, if you look hard enough you could find links between everybody. If everybody in the world is linked through six degrees of separation, imagine what that number is in DC. You could link literally any two people probably by two mutuals at most. This is where we need to be careful! We all want to uncover the truth but we don't want to recklessly and unnecessarily tarnish innocent reputations in the process.</p></p>

        <p><p>don't dismiss this as a simple shill post, but take the core idea from it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We all want to uncover the truth but we don't want to recklessly and unnecessarily tarnish innocent reputations in the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We want to uncover anything possible, whether it be falsified, covered up, or truthful.  We just want to know everything surround this.</p>
<p>So in the end: keep fighting the good fight, but don't grasp at every straw that comes your way with blind acceptance.  Remember what astroturfing is?</p></p>

        <p><p>I wouldn't dismiss any lead. So I'm strongly against curation. That said,  history is what is going to break this wide open. Like you said DC isn't too big.  These rings have been around for decades. Gacy with Project Delta, Bush with Enron, Dynco being busted full of pedos. There are newspaper articles that name all the players for us.  Dig into newspaper archives!!!</p></p>

        <p><p>Please help me understand pizzagate... if it is only to be focused on Besta and Comet... then this whole sub is pointless... those horses are dead. </p>
<p>I don't see why we aren't allowed to pursue other pizza places as well... especially when they have pictures of stacks of $100s on top of a pizza... or a picture of a baby laying next to a pizza on the floor. </p>
<p>Explain...</p></p>

<p>I went up as up could possibly get... air is too thin up there for most people to survive... I ain't scared. I can take a deep breath... you can see a lot more once you are out of Comet pizzas basement.</p>

<p>This is all above my paygrade in the folder below... Maybe an aeronautics or electrical engineer could understand what they are getting at. </p>
