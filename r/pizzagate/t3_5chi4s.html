        <strong>What to do with your information on Pizzagate. Discuss.</strong>
        <p><p>First, upload your evidence to a public place. Maybe two or three. The censorship occurring is pretty interesting for a variety of reasons. KEEP MAKING INFOGRAPHICS, THEY ARE GREAT.</p>
<p>Second, you should report your evidence to the proper authorities. You can snail mail in a report as a 'discretionary reporter' so that your name isn't tied to it.</p>
<p>Follow the money. Pedophilia, arms dealing, whatever these people are into, the financial relationships need to be mapped out. The money will tell the most complete story.</p>
<p>To the people who say "stop looking into this," they really have no argument to support not looking into the finances of a corrupt machine. </p>
<p>If enough people report the findings, an investigation and report must occur. Even if they tank it, there is still a paper trail. </p>
<p>HERE IS THE BEST PART.</p>
<p>If you, yourself, undercover illegal money laundering and tax evasion, YOU ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVING 10% of the money recovered. So long as you fill out the proper form to the IRS. </p>
<p>(I have actually made money this way, when I discovered my former boss was doing illegal things. To intimidate me, he broke into my home and stole a gun, which he was later arrested with. He had a relationship with the local DA, and nothing ever came of his crimes against me, but the IRS still got him.)</p>
<p>I think evidence of pedophilia is strong, you guys. But, the money is easier to follow and it is a more decisive victory. </p>
<p>Either way, investigate everything. Report everything. Maybe profit.</p>
<p>If someone can prioritize what is most actionable, it will make it easier for people to report.</p>
<p>(On a side note: I believe there is a mind control aspect to all of this. It sounds crazy, but Soros has an email that reveals he has a vocabulary for describing it, where implicit bias is exploited with "othering." My working theory is that some people in the intelligence community, who are "satanists," have been researching mind control for a long time and that rituals are used to weed out who will be used for what purpose. Not everyone is as susceptible to some forms of mind control, as others. If you are suggestible, but also intelligent, you have potential to be a "manchurian candidate" type person. The weakest are merely sacrificed.) </p></p>
