        <strong>In 2001, Human Rights Watch criticized the State Department's yearly report on trafficking, urging them "to include the role of state complicity and corruption in facilitating trafficking and government measures to identify, investigate, and prosecute state agents involved in trafficking."</strong>
        <p><p>HRW also argued that the State Department report "glosses over the problems of state complicity and corruption. Trafficking cannot flourish without the involvement of corrupt police, border guards, and state officials."</p></p>
