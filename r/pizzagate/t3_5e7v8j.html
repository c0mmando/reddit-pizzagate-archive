        <strong>Breaking evidence in Clinton email - nude members only ping pong club video</strong>
        <p><p>It is well known that many evil psychopaths like to brag about their crimes in subtle or even "hiding in plain sight." I believe I have found such a "trophy."</p>
<p>OK we start with this email.</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/10037</p>
<p>The penultimate email (non clinton campaign) is zschwartz@shangrila.us. A little investigation reveals this is Zach Schwartz, a producer at Shangrila Productions. His only  (CORRECTION: FIRST) producing credit is for a weird movie called "Girl Walk s into a Bar." </p>
<p>The exact middle of the trailer for this movie, and by far the strangest scene in it, is this: a <em>nude</em> members only Ping Pong Club. </p>
<p>Fast forward to 44 minutes into the movie (http://www.56.com/u56/v_NTg4NjUwMDU.html) &lt;&lt;&lt; WORKING LINK, and what do we get?</p>
<p>Introduced with "Pink's chilli dog's and donuts", we move to a scene of a members only ping pong club where each member is fully nude, playing ping pong and laughing creepily. A nude child sized person sprints (as if running away) into a back room on the right of the frame. A blonde woman laughs manically in the center. The only green paddle is held just in front of where the child ran to. The rest are red.</p>
<p>The masked robber whispers "What?", to which his partner replies "Can you believe these perverts?"</p>
<p>"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"</p>
<p>"I doubt it."</p>
<p>"Aldo always said I don't see the big picture. Well now I see it and it's panoramic."</p>
<p>"Well let's take some pictures. We already know their names. We could send these pictures to their kid's schools, their bosses, and what not."</p>
<p>The odds of this being a coincidence are near zero given what we know.</p>
<p>Finally, the movie has one song in it written by the writer  of the movie itself. The lyrics are incredibly weird.</p>
<p>Down with the manners</p>
<p>Up with dress</p>
<p>Johnny sweet talk to Alice into this mess</p>
<p>No you dont bring checkers to the big game of chess</p>
<p>You know that only bad can come (x2)</p>
<p>Down with the shutters</p>
<p>Up with the lights</p>
<p>Johnny sweet talk Alice all through the night</p>
<p>No world full of kisses gonna make it alright</p>
<p>You know that only bad can come (x2)</p>
<p>Listen to your ma</p>
<p>Listen to your pa</p>
<p>Listen to your heart</p>
<p>Listen to the lie</p>
<p>Only bad can come (x2)﻿</p>
<p>All starting from a photo with a child and a pizza surrounded by two creepy looking women eating pizza sent around people within the Clinton campaign captioned "As John [podesta] said, it doesn't get any better than this.".... There was one reply: "nice."</p>
<p>Hang em high!</p></p>

        <p><p>...that stars Danny DeVito, Rosario Dawson, Zachary Quinto, and others.</p>
<p>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1682246/</p>
<p>However that doesn't mean the creator wasn't inspired by a certain pizza/ping pong club.</p></p>

        <p><p>Supposing it was a regular movie, why would a barely starting studio let a first time, inexperienced producer create a movie with a tiny budget yet which stars 5 a-list celebs, and is distributed for free (ie at a loss.) Something very fishy.</p></p>

        <p><p>Hi there. I know I'm late to the party here, but as a person who works in film, I'd like to clear a couple of things up. </p>
<p>First: it is not sketchy at all for some apparently rando corporation to sponsor an indie film or first-time producer. I checked out Schwartz's IMDb &amp; he has a couple of previous credits that make sense in this context. </p>
<p>Second: it really is a thing for A-Listers to do artsy, indie shows even if they won't make money. Actors are typically paid on the front end (like crew - myself) so the back end profit on any film isn't really what it's about for them. </p>
<p>Third: Rosario Dawson is actually all about the artsy of it all. It's no surprise she'd take this gig. </p>
<p>Fourth: this film is actually for sale &amp; rental, so it is still currently generating revenue. </p>
<p>Now having said all that: this plot is possibly pizzagate related (I have not watched the film) or maybe makes reference to it. I just want an understanding here that young filmmakers &amp; studios almost always seek outside funding for their projects - like any start-up -and while they may sometimes be connected personally, a lot of times they aren't. </p>
<p>It's very easy for us to put all of Hollywood into one pile. I see a lot of that from people outside of the business. And while I'm not defending (or even commenting) on the content of this particular film, please do understand that associating every show with "Hollywood" is pretty much the same as calling every tech start-up "Google." </p>
<p>Cheers :) </p></p>

<p>Also, in the trailer for the movie one character says "All words have double meanings".</p></p>

<p>Now <em>that's</em> creepy, considering all the doublespeak revolving around this.</p></p>

        <p><p>Also of minor interest, Schwarzt is credited as "assistant: Mr. Bing" in Shine a Light (2008). Presumably this is Steve Bing, founder of Shangrila Productions. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bing </p>
<p>"Stephen Leo "Steve" Bing (born March 31, 1965) is an American businessman, film producer, and donor to progressive causes. He is the founder of the Shangri-La business group, an organization with interests in property, construction, entertainment, and music."</p>
<p>"The biggest checks were written in 2002 when [Steve Bing] gave a total of $8.2 million to the Democratic National Committee. But he also has given to specific candidates, including Al Gore, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Nancy Pelosi and Dianne Feinstein." </p>
<p>"On December 18, 2008, the William J. Clinton Foundation released a list of all contributors. It included Stephen L. Bing, who gave between US$10–25 million."</p>
<p>"Bing has attracted attention for being involved in high-profile lawsuits."</p></p>

        <p><p>Steve Bing and Bill Clinton also rescued Euna Lee and Laura Ling (Lisa's Ling's sister) from North Korea.  I believe they were investigating human trafficking. Euna and Laura were also in that pizza.jpg image with Laura's daughter in the Podesta e-mails.  I'm trying to find that image.</p></p>

        <p><p>Kids being stolen in China is very, very common now. It happens in every city, in broad daylight, and the thefts that are recorded on CCTV show whole teams working together to steal kids from unwitting parents or grandparents. Usually a woman is the one to actually take the child away, and the others restrain and accuse the real parent/guardian of trying to steal 'her' baby. </p></p>

<p>Not to mention they splice a picture of santa monica blvd, donuts, what looks to be a sex shop next to a piercing and tattoo place then pinks hot dogs then the open sign then what seems to allude to a hipster style nude ping pong secret club...</p></p>

        <p><p>Bro they even talk about the artwork and what psychological effect it has on people... I watched the movie from 44 minutes until the end. I really think that ping pong shit is damning. That's not a coincidence.</p>
<p>Edit: in the ping pong scene, the way he reacts with the "blackmail" stuff.. It seems like they're using the "double meaning" on what he actually walked into..</p></p>

        <p><p>Yea bucks was definitely in there too, I saw that.. I mean, that is SUCH a niche restaurant, how could it be coincidental? A naked pedo-creepy ping pong place, AND the Bucks camping and fishing as well? What the actual fuck.. This rabbit hole is too deep.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well they are all run by the same people and creepy is as creepy does.</p>
<p>They are drawn together for their creepy hipster shit...</p>
<p>Please read through this gets long</p>
<p>Their close vicinity isnt a smoking gun per se but with the WtP shit that happened, and the fact massive amounts of twitter CP was found, and theres massive plain sight CP rings being uncovered; I mean this all started from weird pizza related words.</p>
<p>It could still be coincidence, but then you remember what you heard about hollywood and what happened to Corey Feldman, then you hear about R Kelly, and then you  remember Epstein, and those Salon articles. </p>
<p>Then there was that preanonymous pedo sting operation on IRC about 8~9ish years back that shut down a massive international CP ring, and one of the guys said to them something like: "you have no idea who we are we are powerful people we have the means and we will get you"</p>
<p>Then you remember there are so many orgs related to stopping human trafficking whose leaders seem to be popping up around these things, and then you remember the massive UN CP ring where not one person there was fired or even investigated and the UN covered it up, and you remember the same thing happening with the pentagon, investigations just stopped, nothing came of them..</p>
<p>TL;DR there are so many known powerful kiddy fiddlers that operate within various circles, some pizza places that operate the same way are in no way too far fetched</p></p>

        <p><p>The two woman are Laura Ling and Euna Lee, reporters investigating sex trafficking supposedly, and someone has claimed that is one of their daughters - that they are creepily fellatio-ing a pizza with.  They were jailed by Korea and rescued by Bill Clinton himself. That itself is very odd with the pose of the picture and comment on it in the email.</p>
<p>However, this story doesn't add up, because a former president - known for rapes, doesn't just come and rescue unknown reporters or succeeded in doing it without something more going on. i.e. spies, involved in sex trafficking?  They worked for a company that could be a front company, Al Gore started it, and it folded a few years later.  Far too many connections too high up and businesses (and business in Korea) not explainable.</p>
<p>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/04/laura-ling-euna-lee</p>
<p>Laura Ling and Euna Lee, reporters for Al Gore's Current TV, were detained by North Korea along the border with China in March. Accused of illegally entering the country and engaging in "hostile acts", the pair were sentenced to 12 years' hard labour in June.</p>

        <p><p>New as I am to all of this, I don't know how relevant Doug Band is, but I was just looking through some of the notes I've made over the past few days and I found his name there and realized that's who sent this pizza-eating photograph e-mail. For whatever it's worth, </p>
<p>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3769724/Clinton-aide-Doug-Band-sought-favor-asked-Huma-Abedin-diplomatic-passport.html</p>
<p>"Band, who assisted Bill Clinton for years and became a close counselor after Clinton left the White House, made the [diplomatic] passport appeal to Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, in an email released by open government group Judicial Watch Thursday."</p>
<p>From wikipedia: "Diplomatic passport — Issued to diplomats of a country and their accompanying dependents for official international travel and residence. Accredited diplomats of certain grades may be granted diplomatic immunity by a host country, but this is not automatically conferred by holding a diplomatic passport. Any diplomatic privileges apply in the country to which the diplomat is accredited; elsewhere diplomatic passport holders must adhere to the same regulations and travel procedures as are required of other nationals of their country."</p></p>

<p>Doug Band Memo at heart of new FBI investigation
www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-26/doug-band-
Oct 25, 2016 · We have written frequently in recent weeks about a feud that erupted between Chelsea Clinton and Doug Band back in 2011 after Chelsea raised concerns about ...  </p>
<p>This kindof goes back to something I've been thinking of - that the picture was an indication of <strong>blackmail</strong> information they had on someone else.  remember, Bill Clinton helped those women reporters for some reason.  <strong>CHEESE (in picture)</strong>, and <strong>"nice"</strong> as a comment might mean <strong>"we have the goods"</strong>.   </p>
<p>wasn't there an encoded emblem hidden in this picture?</p></p>

        <p><p>The email is 2009, when Zach Schwartz was assistant to Bing, with more than $20m contributed.</p>
<p>The scene in the middle is directly analagous to the famous Spirit Cooking photo of Podesta, with a fish/paddle on the right side (where the only green paddle is seen after the child/fish runs on the side), and on the left is the number 14, which is the total number of people in the scene including those behind and to the left of the camera.</p>
<p>The guy in the middle of the scene is in the exact same pose and looks very similar to a younger Podesta (Pedosta)</p></p>

        <p><p>14 is the digit written on Podesta's hand in a photo regarding spirit cooking. Sorry I cannot provide better details. This is just my memory of a story from reddit explaining the number as it related to mythology. Some character being cut into 14 pieces, efforts to reassemble lacked his penis. Please research.  I have been at this for too long.</p></p>

        <p><p>Its Egyptian. The story of Osiris being cut up I think and his wife putting him back together but having to make a fake penis because of a fish ate it. I can't believe this shit. </p></p>

        <p><p>I think the fish has a double meaning. It refers to Albert Fish, a cannibal serial killer (you know how these guys are always joking about babies for dinner). To Satanists, the sign of the fish refers to the heart chakra or a child's heart. Look up. They use the symbol all the time with the word Satan in the center. </p></p>

        <p><p>There was a YouTube video I saw that really broke down what was going on. I'll try to find it. But the author stated that it had deep meaning and the fish symbol also carried a number that was a mirror image or something. He said that having the 14 + the fish = showing off hidden knowledge or something. </p>
<p>Edit: found video link
https://youtu.be/9YxaCrxDrxo</p>
<p>This should probably be downloaded by someone before it goes missing like the video and accompanying Wikileaks article from the description. </p></p>

There is no podesta look alike posing as he did, there is not 14 people in that room and the child is an adult woman running to her spot she is supposed to be in. There also is no fish.. i call BULLSHIT, stop spreading fake information</p></p>

        <p><p>I mean, there's a lot of creepy stuff here, but ignoring all the other stuff, that's a large walk in refrigerator/freezer. It's a restaurant. In the TV Show, <a href="http://www.seeing-stars.com/Dexter/VillainsLair.shtml">Dexter used one of those at least once as a filming location</a>, and they do look creepy when empty.</p>
<p>There's this second narrative of all this where this dude is just a creepy artist.. but it's REALLY over the top.  All of the efforts should be connecting the Podestas to Portugal. This other stuff is noise until there's a real child gone missing, rather than creepy but circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p>The signal-to-noise ratio is the problem with conspiracies. You NEED someone in the mainstream media to follow this up, and there's so much stuff like this that makes it easy to dismiss around here.</p>
<p>Artists are broken. Artists are abused. Artists are often reflecting their own experiences in weird ways. That doesn't mean they're representing their own actions. </p>
<p>This is not to excuse any of this, but if you're familiar with modern art, there's SO MUCH creepy stuff.</p>
<p>Tony Podesta is the best vector.  He smells the worst (aside from Jimmy) Lot's of John's emails sound completely innocent whether they are or not. If you really want somebody to do some 'digging' on this, that's the place to start.</p></p>

        <p><p>I totally agree. The biggest problem we have with the whole pizzagate thing is that a lot of the evidence (not all) is just a bunch of very coincidental connections, and because they use coded words, it's hard to nail them. Yes, the things they say are very weird/creepy, but not enough on there own to actuall arrest anyone.</p>
<p>The other side is, do we want the police/FBI to be able to abreast people based on the kinds of coincidental evidence that pizzagate has shed light on? That seems dangerous. </p></p>

        <p><p>Think the OP is right. It would seem that this movie was at least "inspired" by actual goings on. They're not going to show things exactly as they are. Like Miley and her "pizza" obsession. Is it the food she's talking about or something else? Think of it as an inside joke. You've had an inside joke, right? You and your friends know what you're all talking about, but to the people on the outside? They're wondering what the heck you're laughing at. </p></p>

        <p><p>Minute 38 or so. Each bar (except the nude ping pongs one) is introduced with a photo of the logo of the bar.</p>
<p>This one is introduced with a pink donut logo, then "Pink's chilli dog's and burgers", then the nude ping pong club exclusive, members only, then the creepy scene described.</p></p>

        <p><p>Ok, interesting. Not really related, but the way you had typed it, made me think of the buck's fishing and camping creepy picture on their website. There's a pink donut sitting there, on top of a steak, with an awkwardly placed candle. In addition to the creepy references of Cake (cocaine?) and Oysters (Oxycontin?) written on a paper using black and white reference when they could've used an actual oyster instead of making it look like a prescription note. I may be going too deep into this, but something's fucky about that picture. In the whole "hiding in plain sight" vibe. Just wouldn't surprise me that people of power would have connections to drugs either.</p></p>

        <p><p>Pizza refers to Penis, Cake meaning Ass/Butt and Oysters mean the Clitoris. At least in the context of that photo. Notice also the candle/dick. It's certainly innuendo. No hiding it.</p></p>

And I've never in my life seen another place with a line around the block for a chili dog....

        <p><p>I watched capturing the Friedmans last night and in it they mention a green leaf symbol being used in pedophile circles. A ping pong paddle is rather leaf shaped and I found it interesting you said the only green one was used in coordination with the back room child. 
Could this be hinting at something?</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>Introduced with "Pink's chilli dog's and donuts", we move to a scene of a members only ping pong club where each member is fully nude, playing ping pong and laughing creepily. A nude child sized person sprints (as if running away) into a back room on the right of the frame. A blonde woman laughs manically in the center. The only green paddle is held just in front of where the child ran to. The rest are red.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no such thing in that scene as a child running away into a back room. It's a thin woman (who is actually taller than the guy she's playing ping pong with) and a big guy running away from the robbers into the stage's left exit. And before that no one is laughing creepily or maniacally. The actors were obviously told to act like they were having fun.</p>
<p>I don't understand why you felt the need to sensationalize your findings. A scene of a nude ping pong private party in a movie produced by a friend of the Clintons who are also friends with the owners of a ping pong themed pizza place is suspicious enough on its own.</p></p>

        <p><p>I wasn't trying to sensationalize the scene. Was trying to write quickly from memory as the Youtube video was blocked after I tried to watch it. I will upload a copy from 56 to Youtube and review to see if my memory wa wrong.</p></p>

        <p><p>Rewatched the scene. You are incorrect.</p>
<p>They are not acting like they are having normal fun, watch them laughing. Not casual smiling and conversation but over the top creepy laughter.</p>
<p>You say thin woman, I believe it looks much more like a young teenage child.</p>
<p>You say running to stage exit, I say running to a back room. Where does the stage exit to? </p></p>

There is no podesta look alike posing as he did, there is not 14 people in that room and the child is an adult woman running to her spot she is supposed to be in.
