   </p>
   <p>
    Edit: We are unsure what exactly is on the phone calls. Has not completely been translated yet.

   <p>
    Edit: One part mentions "The blonde one that never speaks"
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit: See Macnomad84 comments "they're talking about Simone "putanesca sauce" Bemoprad (id: 48897) I have a lead on a possible (FILLED WITH CODE) child traficking site calling his name out specifically. need some #anons to look at it before the reddit hivemind pounds the shit out of the server and it gets pulled by the admin.
PM if really interested in archiving/pursuing this lead"

    First 5 minutes of the 8th of May phone call. 
The audio is not great and some words are not understandable at all . It seems like they are talking about a guy named Simon, I think, who worked at JCB?!
   </p>
   <p>
    W1: Hello?
   </p>
   <p>
    W2: Hello, ciao mamma ciao
   </p>
   <p>
    W1: Can you talk?
   </p>
   <p>
    W2: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes...really you don't have to worry...everything's relatively OK here
   </p>
   <p>
    W1: Relatively? What happened?
   </p>
   <p>
    W2:Simon is a bit anxious...hmm
   </p>
   <p>
    W1: Yes
   </p>
   <p>
    W2: Aaaaand anxious, but he wouldn't talk, I can never understand what's up. And the last weekend I again had the impression that he was looking for something, 
he kept searching to change job...I couldn't understand really. Then Saturday he left saying he rented a cottage and that he's gonna move there and that he feels very anxious he doesn't feel very well, and I did notice that he wasn't feeling fine but you can never tell...anyways he's not aggressive or anything, I mean I can tell he's not fine but...aaaand...
   </p>
   <p>
    W1: So he's moving?
   </p>
   <p>
    W2: Yeah he's moving, he says he might go just on the weekends just so he can have a place to go if he doesn't feel very well so he can find some peace, and then he said that he's always available to come here when I work to stay with the kids and for that thing, it could also be ok, I mean things are how they are...
   </p>
   <p>
    W1: The more you **** (can't tell what she says) the better
   </p>
   <p>
    W2: Yeah right right right, it's a bit sad but in the end it's a practical solution...I was just worried about the fact that he was nervous, and also him searching a new job place didn't make lot of sense...unless something happened to him but he didn't say anything...so yeah... ****(can't tell what she says and who she's talking about) he stayed a bit here and then he went to sleep there, then he came back here and then he went back there in the afternoon and then he came back here to eat...there was a time he would go to this place where....so he would go back and forth but after all everything was fine hmm... and then yesterday night he says “I'm leaving and I'll see you tomorrow if I get back for dinner etc” and I say “All right” and then he calls me 20 minutes later and I asked him “Are you already there?”  because I'm not quite sure where this place is, maybe it's close but...eh...and he says “Yes yes yes I'm there...I wanted to tell you something because...hmm” and I said “I don't understand what is going on, if you're leaving definitively or if you're doing back and forth” and he says “No no it's just so I can have some space” Well fine...as he wishes....and then he says “ I have to make you understand what is going on. Somebody sent an anonymous letter to JCB where I work saying and explaining that I was arrested and I got a suspended sentence...” I mean I didn't know this, I learned this yesterday night
   </p>
   <p>
    W1: I swear too, I believed you withdrew the charges....
    <strong>
     *
    </strong>
    *since it was a partial complaint (can't tell what she's saying)
   </p>
   <p>
    W2: Exactly Exactly...I thought yes yes...
   </p>
   <p>
    W1: I believed that since you pressed charges, it was over for him.
   </p>
   <p>
    W2: Indeed! I thought I didn't tell you anything about it, I thought I was silent about this part... I don't remember anymore, I know it was a while ago but now that you make me notice it...
   </p>
   <p>
    W1: I didn't know...I believed you..
   </p>
   <p>
    W2: Yeah but I didn't even think for a second he could be him...honestly not at all, I asked you and maybe I shouldn't have asked but...
   </p>
   <p>
    W1: And then you say “the world is full of crazy people”
   </p>
   <p>
    W2: Yeah yeah yeah yeah
   </p>
   <p>
    W1: I talked about these things to uncle Ranieri and obviously with uncle Roberto...but I didn't talk about it with anybody else.
   </p>
   <p>
    W2: No no no right
   </p>
   <p>
    W1: And then, who knows... Giorgio could go crazy too, uncle Ranieri could go crazy ...they can't know that...
   </p>
   <p>
    W2: And I didn't know too and even if I had told you more I couldn't have been able to tell you because I didn't know, he didn't tell me...I thought he was absolved I mean he told me that he was “BOUND” (?!?) which means that for an year you can't... like you can't even get caught littering on the grass...and I thought everything was over and then yesterday night he told me that his sentence was suspended and if he had to do something illegal he would go to jail immediately...but I didn't know it so even if I had told you more I couldn't have been able to because I didn't know...

     *8TH OF MAY PHONE CALL PART 2
    </p>
    <p>
     W2: And he told me that someone sent a letter to JCB...and I had this doubt that maybe it's not true...who could be behind it? And he said it must be us because the letter came from abroad. And I said “Simon it's impossible it doesn't make any sense...the letter said things I didn't know myself so...my parents know even less than me” and he got a bit blank for a while because maybe he forgot himself that he didn't tell me, then he says “I'm going to bed”. So, at first I was surprised I didn't think it could be a lie but this morning I realized that it might not be true...
    </p>
    <p>
     W1: I don't think it's true, he wants to leave for some reason...or he might have done something wrong and they are gonna make him leave...
    </p>
    <p>
     W2: I thought about it too this morning..although it's not possible to confirm it. I told him “If someone did it it's because of what you did at work” **
     <em>
      she tells her mother that he had some behavior problems at work  like leaving slamming the door
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     W1:Excuse me one second, why does the company he works for right now care if he had a fight with his wife?
    </p>
    <p>
     W2: They could care...I mean he didn't tell them when he did the interview. He didn't say any of this, it was his business and if this thing would have came out he could have been penalized. For what I know his criminal record is clean. But, if he didn't lie he didn't reveal...But, here they always make you sign a paper that asks you if you had criminal record and maybe that's why he got fired ...but it might not be true...I don't understand what's going on...he's not very well...now he moved, he goes back and forth, he's very silent, he's not aggressive...
    </p>
    <p>
     W1: He drinks?
    </p>
    <p>
     W2: Right now no, but he was drinking. But in these last weeks no, I think his ulcer hurts, this last weekend he never drunk even because he's going back to the cottage and he's very careful not to drink when he drives, he actually never got caught. And I don't know...As long as the situation stays pacific he can stay at the cottage, I don't care...If he decides to keep the children...with the girls he was calm. I just hope the situation doesn't explode or it will be a disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
     W1: Do you think he still works there?
    </p>
    <p>
     W2:I think he does but he's looking for another work place. I don't know. **she explains he's looking for a contract job because they pay more.
    </p>
    <p>
     W1: What can we do to help?
    </p>
    <p>
     W2: Just be calm, if you're calm I'm calm.
    </p>
    <p>
     W1: You well understand that we can't be that calm, come on.
    </p>
    <p>
     W2: I know, but what can I do about it? Let's just try to keep the situation quiet. I don't care if he moves away as long as he helps me with the girls and send me some money. For now he seems open to do that so we'll see...Now we need to let things go for a bit...with the right timing...
    </p>
    <p>
     W1: The situation is becoming more and more absurd...
    </p>
    <p>
     W2: Indeed but we need to not piss him off because if he doesn't keep the kids I don't know who would ...I have so much work, and then if he gets pissed off he wouldn't send me any money.. so let's leave things as they are right now..please try to stay calm.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm gonna summarize now or it will take me forever to transcript every single word they say. Nothing seems to be relevant to the investigation of pizzagate tho.
    </p>
    <p>
     -The daughter (W2) thinks Simon's sister suggested him to move to a cottage. Simon also has a brother.
    </p>
    <p>
     -W2 informed her father in law that Simon is not well anymore but she understands if he doesn't want to be involved again.
    </p>
    <p>
     -The daughter explains that the kids seem not to give a shit Simon moved out. Right after the mother says “The problem is the blond one who never says anything”.(I guess he's one of W2's kids)
    </p>
    <p>
     -The situation is quiet right now, not as it used to be.
    </p>
    <p>
     -It's essential that W2 keeps working and that she doesn't  contradict Simon until she's economically independent.
    </p>
    <p>
     -W1 wants W2 to tell her everything in the future and asks her to call her if there are any problems. She asks her daughter if she wants her to go visit her, W2 says no. They say I love you to each other.
PHONE CALL ENDS
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm gonna peace out now, it's 1AM here, I can do more translating tomorrow!

           Play off the Watergate scandal. Pizza is allegedly referring to child sex or something.

            I get it. But it sounds like some circlejerk-esque joke subreddit, not a sub about a child prostitution scandal. Nobody is going to take it seriously.

             If you look at some of the other evidence surrounding it, its pretty fucking disgusting and its clear, somthing sinister is going on. Cheese Pizza =C.P.= Child Porn. And in one email they describe a hankerchief thatbis white and black. There is such a thing as the "hankerchief code" and the colors are indicative of the description of the victim. It is no joke. Look up Laura Sillsby's relation to Hillary Clinton in regards to children in Haiti. Look at who owns the entire block where comet ping pong is, and look at their neighbors pizza logo of "Besta Pizza" next to the FBI's "known pedophile symbols" document. And ask yourself why the Clinton Foundation's charities operate in countries that dont issue birth certificates.  Child sex trafficking happens, there is alot of money in it, whether Clinton is directpy invloved, who knows. But she is aquanted with people who are sure as shit directly involved. If we can save some childrens lives from this fate we should take this seriously and demand answers and a real investigation.

             we are a work in progress. we don't want it going viral yet. We have to wait til we see if we are right. we want awareness though. there's no OMG fact yet but there's a lot of circumstantial evidence and it's pretty heavy to just outright dismiss it. we get leads we try to follow them. all the leads don't always pan out

             NYPD is laready on the case as I understand. Pedos use code. The police will know what they're looking for. Wikileaks published this for a reason.

             Oh yes they will. These words "Pizza", "sauce", and so forth are known pedophile code words. Its very relevant.

            It's bizarre. Their "evidence" boils down to a couple emails, some instagram photos and a triangle in a logo.

             It seems satirical.  The Instagram pictures weren't even bad, some weird art I guess.  And if someone was a part of a child sex ring why would they post evidence publicly on Instagram?

          Before you get TOO far off base...put on your thinking cap and wonder how it is this conversation was recorded and stored in the first place? Seems a bit strange that such surveillance would be in place for a normal family conversation. Hello.
         </p>
         <p>
          Someone told or threatened to...they were under surveillance and it's not rocket science to wonder what "keeping children" is.

         Wikileaks is 100% accurate, so there must be child sex. The cottage is obviously code for the child sex dungeon. /s

        Or remember the "creepy daycare" that reddit investigated, and it turned out to just be a day care? The local neckbeards were even peering into the windows and creeping out the staff and kids.

         I remember and am glad it turned out to be nothing. How often is something sweeped under the carpet when there actually IS something happening? 
I don't mind being wrong. I do mind though when something looks fishy and is ignored.

          I can't link to the original thread because it was shut down due to doxxing, but it was pretty much exactly "Check out this creepy looking daycare" in r/pics. Then another user chimed in that they had never seen kids coming or going, and from there things spiraled out of control. The Vice article is accurate as far as my recollection goes.

        It's on wiki leaks labeled as child sex, it's not even like they did any investigation themselves to find the tape, it was released by a watchdog organization. You're way off base.

          Anything labeled "child sex" from a reputable watchdog organization needs to be investigated. Bar none. It doesn't have to be splashed everywhere, but it needs to be checked out.

           It saddens me to say but wikileaks reputability took a great hit in 2010 when they released the Afghani war documents without redacting names of Afghan informants. No matter how this happened, it was bad.
          </p>
          <p>
           By that time it already seemed as if it was compromised from the inside. News of conflicting views within the top of the organization seeped out.
          </p>
          <p>
           Early on I thought we'd see a Cryptome 2.0 but it hasn't really materialized. Sadly.
          </p>
          <p>
           edit; It does release interesting info and docs but I feel I've lost my trust in their motives some years ago.

            Their 'motives' are to release raw, uncensored data. Is it really that surprising that there's some innocent/useless information in there when the entire process is:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Receive absurdly large batch of leaked documents
            </li>
            <li>
             Verify source's credibility
            </li>
            <li>
             <em>
              Attempt
             </em>
             to review absurdly large batch of documents with a likely understaffed and scattered team
            </li>
            <li>
             Dump information indiscriminately
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            If there's anything to question about their motives, it's the stuff that's been currently happening since Assange's internet was cut. See: r/whereisassange

             By not redacting (all) names of (active) informants they likely sentenced those people, and possibly their families, to death.
            </p>
            <p>
             I assume it was a mistake, but it ripped out part of my (wishful) trust.
            </p>
            <p>
             I also dislike the tone that since has transpired a couple of times through some of their social media accounts.

         yeah but to think after all this time some redditor would be the first to discover this, if it were anything huge, would be pretty strange. Definitely considering its literally called "child sex"

        The Boston Bomber fiasco was a modern day, digital agent provocateur move by the government. They saw the power that crowd sourced investigations could hold and they needed something to widely discredit it before anything like Pizzagate even began. And they've been trying to sabotage this investigation as well by spreading everyone extremely thin and all over the place with no concerted core effort.

I used to be in communications research. There are quite enormous and thoroughly disgusting studies done directly on the subject of swaying mass opinion through social media and there is even even more research being done on how to fracture opinions to keep people from banding together behind community driven investigations.

Honestly, this post we're replying to, is pretty spot on for what needs to be done to drive people off track. Overly emotional headline demanding overly emotional expectations in content that someone else must interpret which builds excitement until its finally revealed that it was about nothing and certainly not at all related to the core investigation in any way. And guess what, it worked. It kept tons of people locked up in this topic and will send tons of people off on tangents trying to find some way this connects to everything else when it never did in the first place. This further fractured our investigation, bleeding people off onto wild goose chases.

We all need to be diligent in identifying these tactics that push us further from the direct evidence we started with. Epstein, Alefantis, the Clintons, the Podestas, Brock, et al. - pizzapac/Pizza Spice Packets LLC, Comet Ping Pong, probably Besta, Bucks, Terasol and Politics &amp; Prose. We need to be researching the people directly associated with these places. Otherwise, this investigation is doomed.

        This is a very aggressive response, almost too defensive.

        The fact as someone said it's indexed on a site known for credible leaks should warrant some suspicions.

        No it is not. I really don't get why everytime Reddit doesn't hit a home-run people flock back to that tired old statement. This is nothing like the Boston Bomber. There is evidence from those involved personal social media accounts.

        While I can understand people wanting to help out, the Boston Bomber fiasco was essentially social justice attempting to uphold the law.

         At least the Boston bomber redditors had something legitimate to chase. Not condoning that behavior one bit, but that also goes for the morons who have been passing pizzagate as truth.

          I mean social justice in the most literal sense, not the SJW type justice. In that average people using social media were the ones doing the investigating.

       Yeah I agree. What I got from this conversation is that this Simon guy somehow fucked up and the wife (W2) and her family are freaking out a bit. I'll see what the other wav files are about tomorrow.

        Sounds to me like it could be domestic abuse or maybe Simon was looking at kiddie porn at work.

       Unless the people in the questions don't have children, and are talking about the children they are holding. "The blonde one that never speaks" is a odd way to talk about a daughter. Everything else has been cryptic and now people expect people to start talking plainly about underage sex slaves...

        This is probably surveillance recording from the Madeleine McCann investigation. I'm pretty sure someone at some point believed that "The blonde one that never speaks" could have been Madeleine. This has nothing to do with pizza or Podesta. It might also be any child sex investigation. But I bet that a blond girl in the hands of a child sex ring in Italy definitely would be interesting to the McCann investigators.

         You're probably right. There's a lot of misinformation going around here. Anybody can just throw something up and a bunch of people pile into it grasping at straws.

        I just stumbled on this post following the link someone posted on the Italy sureddit asking for a translation.
First, "The blonde one" is a boy, because she says "quello" and not "quella", tartaruganinja even wrote "he" in the translation, but maybe you didn't notice.
Second, it might seems shady and cryptic, but really... It's not. Reading a translation of a phone conversation makes it lose a lot of its meaning, because the words you can use in english don't convey the exact same meaning of the originals in italian and the pace, the inonation, the pauses, the sound of the voice is totally lost. Trust me, I am an italian, I can understand when someone is speaking spontaneously, saying what comes to mind in a casual family conversation, instead of communicating in code to send some secret messages.
It's really, really, just a conversation between a daughter abroad telling his mother about this guy who fucked up doing something, has problems with wife and kids and anxiety. To be able to have that conversation faking everything and sending a secret message at the same time you must be half cold war era superspy injected with some experimental drugs, half batman.

        There are professionals investigators in this world that are experts because they studied and trained for years, if it were so easy police would let reddit users investigate everything.

       im sure they are speaking using some code instead of being obvious. the way they talk about the kids so vaguely really makes me think there is more to it.

         Being a native speaker were they cues you could pick up from tones of voice etc that may give hints to the underbelly of the conversation?

          Not really. In the first conversation W2 is a bit frantic, she doesn't complete her sentences, mumbles, she uses fillers like "hmmm, yeah, right" a lot and constantly interrupts her mother but that's normal I think, given the nature of the phone call.  Other than that I personally wasn't able to catch anything. I don't think there's anything in these phone calls, although it would be interesting to hear another native's point of view.

           Sinceramente, non so quanto ti convenga sprecare del tempo per tradurre sti audio, i commentatori non leggono neanche quello che scrivi e prendono fischi per fiaschi (vedi per esempio tutti quelli che pensano "quello biondo" sia una ragazza, mentre hai scritto espressamente "he"). Poi non sentendo il tono e le parole usate pensano sia tutta una discussione in codice fra superspie stile guerra fredda, non capiscono che sono una all'estero che parla con la madre a proposito di uno che ha fatto casini con la famiglia. Dimmi te se da come parlano in italiano sembra ci sia chissà che preparazione o codice, ma sti qua leggendo la trascrizione si immaginano voci e modi e significati che non ci sono.

Anche io come te non penso ci sia alcun gomblotto in queste intercettazioni, pero' vorrei proprio capire perche' erano state nominate come child sex italy su wikileaks.

           In that context however...why do you feel that these people were 1. being monitored 2. recorded and archived, and 3. leaked?
          </p>
          <p>
           I know that no one would understand some of my calls..they would just think I'm cheerful and happy :) but the person on the other end knows what I mean.
          </p>
          <p>
           I don't suppose it's possible for us to know if they were being obtuse due to surveillance fears...but I will say for my own part...I'm not a crook per se (love the plant meds) but I automatically assume EVERYTHING I email and say in text/calls is being monitored and using words that are singular to my "circle" means heads nor tales would ever be made....and could never be used as proof of anything.
          </p>
          <p>
           Divorce could mean many things like getting out..keeping the children...gak...money for keeping the children...
          </p>
          <p>
           I don't know if it is logical to toss this out when someone, somewhere went to the trouble to eavesdrop, save and leak. I think caution is needed on both sides of the issue...not jump to OMG conspiracy, and yet not be so quick to throw it out.

            Anything is possible man, I'm not trying to toss this out, I'm just saying that, from my personal point of view, I really don't think there's anything wrong with these phone calls and maybe the search needs to focus elsewhere. 
Of course I might be wrong and I do think it's weird that they ended up on Wikileaks and labeled that way but, concretely, nothing in those phone calls sounded off to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Peace :)

             depends on what else links to it. It is not usual for Wikileaks to waste resources on stuff...so pays to keep this in mind just in case.

      So this thread has been linked from r/conspiracy, r/The_Donald, and a lot more. And right now it's looking like this is a regular old phone record with no mention of "child sex". So either these files take a drastic turn in the last few that have yet to be translated, or Wikileaks just baited half of Reddit with a click bait title.

        If that's true then that means there's going to be some child sex in the some of these transcripts that haven't been translated yet. Which looks kinda unlikely but who knows. Also nothing yet linking it to Podesta, as OP suggested. So I guess we have to wait and see.

          Right in the edits of the post. Unless "could be related to Podesta Madeline child abduction" means something different "could be related to Podesta Madeleine child abduction"

           Maybe he meant this. Pulled it from the 4chan thread that exposed this Madeline stuff.

       Maybe the call was recorded as a part of an investigation that found them not suspicious, that could explain the title

      There is absolutely nothing wrong with this phone call. I don't think there's anything that leads to child trafficking or pizzagate. I really doubt these two women are up to something,  I actually feel like an asshole for listening to their private phone calls. I think I'm gonna stop here with the phone calls.
     </p>
     <p>
      SUMMARY OF THE CONVERSATION:
     </p>
     <p>
      (The audio is bad in this one.)
     </p>
     <p>
      W2 CALLS W1
     </p>
     <p>
      -W2 seems to be on a train.
     </p>
     <p>
      -W2 lives in the UK
     </p>
     <p>
      -W1 asks about the kids. They are fine, they are at school.
     </p>
     <p>
      -They are talking affectionately about a little kid, I think one of W2's kids or nephews.
     </p>
     <p>
      -W1 is complaining about how she's not making any business anymore because people
     </p>
     <p>
      stopped shopping. She complains there is no enthusiasm in buying things anymore.
     </p>
     <p>
      -They are talking about grocery shopping.
     </p>
     <p>
      -W1 is making a list of what she bought at the grocery store and complains about how expensive it was to buy just a few things.
     </p>
     <p>
      -They are talking about how prices went up with the Euro.
     </p>
     <p>
      -W1 mentions she used to live in Milan.
     </p>
     <p>
      -They are talking about the cost of dishwashers and prosciutto.
     </p>
     <p>
      -It's not clear what W2 job is, she says “for what I do”, even in the other phone call she would referrer at her job as “what I do”. She seems some sort of freelancer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Phone call ends.

      Divorce, who gets the caged child sex slaves!?  She does not want them, they are mainly his sex toys, he'll probably take them, but at the moment he's going through a crisis (her perspective) the girls, especially one of them hate him.  What are they going to do with the girls?
     </p>
     <p>
      Well, apparently, they are just the pedophilia types, and killing kids via Moloch is not their thing... Maybe Podesta or someone can help...  that's what I read into it...

     Bound probably means on parole or something, look at the context the word is in "you can't even get caught littering on the grass". I've read this through a couple of times but it seems like there's absolutely nothing of consequence in there, am I missing something?

      My guess is a domestic violence order. Given the context and that she mentions that he doesn't have/isn't aware of a criminal record. Someone sent a letter to his workplace outing him and now his job is in jeopardy.

       but what about "I didn't think it could be him" (paraphrased) and "the world is full of crazy people." Sounds more like a wife suspected and reported something.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: making sure to reflect this is a paraphrase of the W1/W2 quotes

      After listening to the other phone calls, I'm pretty positive that this is had nothing to do with the Vanna Marchi case. The name of the daughter doesn't even match.

        No idea. 
They seem very ordinary people, there was nothing shady about the phone conversations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The only thing I can think of is that someone was trying to intercept Simon, but even then, I have no idea how and why he end up on Wikileaks and why that folder was called child sex Italy. What the fuck.

     Again, another normal phone conversation between two women.
    </p>
    <p>
     -W1 is not in this conversation. There is a new woman, W3, who seems to be W2's friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     -W3 is a translator.
    </p>
    <p>
     -W2 is an Italian interpreter from what I got.
    </p>
    <p>
     -W3 is talking about an ex coworker of her, who's landing her new translation jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
     -W3 was hired as a translator for Dow Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
     -W3 bitching about translating.
    </p>
    <p>
     -Dow Jones gave her more translating jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
     -W3 is complaining about how long it took her to get a translation done.
    </p>
    <p>
     -They are talking about thyroid surgery.
    </p>
    <p>
     -W2 is talking about interpreting for an elderly Italian woman hospitalized in the psychiatry wing of an hospital in Chesterfield.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that's pretty much it.

     So, this is the last file. Again, nothing weird or suspicious, just a phone conversation between a mother and a daughter going through tough times. I have no idea why these conversations ended up on Wikileaks. Maybe the person of interest might be Simon but, who knows.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let me know if you have any questions, and let me know if there is more stuff that needs to be translated. I'd just rather have someone to re upload the files somewhere else next time if that's possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     I just want to add that I didn't join reddit yesterday, I created this account for the translations only.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thank you all for the patience. :)
    </p>
    <p>
     Peace!

     -W1 calls W2
    </p>
    <p>
     -W2 says there are no news and she explains her mother what's up with Simon: She hoped Simon would be hospitalized. Social services tried to get an appointment with him but his cellphone is always turned off.  She thinks it's not a good idea that he sees the kids. Simon complained because W2 has phone calls with a psychiatrist. W2 is worried because Simon has been sick for 10 years. He's mad about her not letting him seeing the kids. W2 says it was the social services choice to not allow him to see the kids. W2 recommends Simon to do what social services say. Simon claims he's fine. W2 suggests Simon to go to the social services appointments. She talked with Simon's brother. Simon's father admitted Simon is sick. Simon's mother is in denial.
    </p>
    <p>
     W1 tells W2 “When you come back, make sure he didn't fuck up. Would you let social services know?”
    </p>
    <p>
     W2 is looking for a new place to go with her kids.
    </p>
    <p>
     W2's lawyer recommended her that it's best for Simon to go to therapy before starting the divorce process as she wouldn't be able to divorce someone who is unfit to plead. She's gonna wait a few months.
    </p>
    <p>
     W1 is talking about a kid, her nephew I think. This kid is going to a kindergarten ruled by nuns.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that's it.

    I've been watching and refreshing this for the past 15 minutes, and it's getting a lot of downvotes. I'd say I've seen about 50 upvotes and 30 downvotes since I've been watching. I know it's a very imperfect method to just refresh every few seconds. But who are all these people downvoting it, I wonder?

      Keep vote fuzzing in mind, it's normal to see some degree of downvotes as a post ages, this is why posts can be at 10000+ and drop down to 7-8k

      People are downvoting because you hyped this up to be damning evidence. It's not. Just like everything that's been "uncovered" so far.
     </p>
     <p>
      Edit: and you got loons like /u/azki- spewing the real reason why pizzagate even is a thing. It's a witch hunt.

       Same here. I don't think this is a case of the sub being "compromised", FBI or CTR interference, or leftist brigading - it's just that this whole thing is such a reach.

        It's not so much that it's a reach, but that we have literally droves of people all simultaneously walking into a theater half way through a movie, and making a ton of comments about the plot and characters being stupid
        <strong>
         without even knowing what the movie is about
        </strong>
        . It's just too much information too quickly, and people loving to make snap judgements.

        They don't care. They already have their narrative.

        So now it's time for them to brigade this story in every other sub they can.

        Maybe...but it would seem of interest as to why a normal household mere conversation was made in the first place, then archived...then leaked. I'm almost certain there are none of my conversations, no matter how whacky...on wikileaks.

       I downvoted from /r/all as well. It was on my second page when I made this comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, lol, this fucking sub. It's obvious there was some upvote manipulation to get this so far up and they're literally complaining about the opposite. Is it projecting? Is it to hide their own moves? Or are they really just conspiritards?

      As a mod here, nobody should ever leave evidence they consider important in one place. Post it to multiple subreddits, post it on the chans. Try to get your information into the hands of as many people as possible. I'm really glad we have this sub where people can congregate and compile evidence but we should all assume there will be efforts to disrupt our momentum.

      gotta wonder why there needs to be 19 mods with three throwaway accounts.. several are brand new with no posts.
     </p>
     <p>
      But, then again, I'm paranoid. Reddit does not seem like the right place for this.

       You definitely are paranoid. Trust me there has be review of every mod in the past 2 days. 10 were removed and reviewed. You can find a lot of the mods handing out in the matrix chat for pizzagate located on the sidebar of the subreddit, where we are discussing evidence in real time and working together.

        There is no reason to trust you and,  in fact, a random person on the internet saying "no, really, just trust me buddy" is the least trustworthy thing I can think of.

     These conversations were released in 2008, translated, looked at, and there's nothing of consequence in them. You get downvotes because, yet again, you're all making wild assumptions about nothing. In this case, you're even doing it before you even looked at the evidence. OP posted without even knowing anything about the context: where are these conversations from and why were they leaked. It's an overblown load of nothing, as usual.

      Yea, Everyone wants to crack this wide open but let's be discerning. That being said look at its source and parroting from wiki leaks. Still may be more to it, so let's also keep an open mind.

      Well look at you...gold star! Now why would a normal family be under surveillance and their phone calls recorded and archived and leaked to wikileaks?

       I think the point is that you're

        His comment basically implies the same shit as he's condemning. He's saying people are down voting the post because it's stating shit without facts, but this is about
        <em>
         finding
        </em>
        the facts. So these people would be downvoting without having any facts, huh, who would have guessed the hypocrisy? This is of course all ignoring the fact that the downvotes (at the time) were probably more because of vote fuzzing than some grand conspiracy of "the man", or a flood of dumb people downvoting without informing themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm not saying the post is legit or anything, I'm just saying his comment was dumb as hell, and only really stands to delegitimize all these "CRAAAAAAAZY" conspiracy theorists.

         deciding on a guilty party and attempting to work from anything you find to that guilty party is not sleuthing.  that's witch hunting.  the rest is laid out in the OP, if you need further information.

        I understood you. I don't write upvote bots because karma is useless. But a robot that upvote things shouldn't care what the karma score is. Even if you did care, you can figure out the range it floats, or compare to how it ranks against other posts to get it's range.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regardless, how would it possibility prevent a robot from upvoting?

         It doesnt. But you cant see if your bot is shadow banned or not because even if you didnt vote, and nobody else did, the numbers changed. Guess there are also other reasons, no idea. I am just stating the reason for this according to their documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
         But seriously, try comparing. Reddit really does a good job making this numbers random enough that its hard to work with them.

          Assuming for a moment I was making a vote bot, we know it would be a command line script that interacts with the reddit API (but I guess screen scraping could be done with a bit more effort). If I can run one, I can run two. I could also run them from different providers. I could have one not engage in voting so it doesn't violate and rules and has no connection with the rest and it could see if the others got banned. Running a validation instance is a trivial amount of work.
         </p>
         <p>
          I guess my point is, if end users know about the fuzziness, anyone engaging in this type of activity will too. So now you are impacting regular users for something that is trivial to work around.

           I fully agree with you actually. I think i could easily work around this issue too, next to that i would ignore the numbers anyway. Really just stating the idea behind it :)
          </p>
          <p>
           I tried to find another use case somewhere in the docs or reddit, but all i really found seems to agree with the limited use case:

     I'm also going to downvote this thread unless anybody comes up with something to show that it is even remotely related to Podesta/Clinton/CometPizza/DNC/Pizzagate, etc...

      It's a way for conspiracy theorists to get over the widespread rejection of their ideas, a neat little eddy of confirmation bias. "Down votes like this wouldn't be happening if it were real people like me giving this information a fair shot (ie looked at it with my biases)." From there, it's a short hop to believing The Powers That Be are somehow manipulating the reception, which in turn lends credibility to whatever it is they're supposedly suppressing.

         thats not even what we're talking about, this post got bombarded with downvotes at the beginning which is unusual because the people on this sub have no reason to mass-downvote this, saying that a downvote bot isn't a possibility is plain stupid because there are thousands of them, there always have been and there always will be
        </p>
        <p>
         now I'm not saying that this is the case, but you can't rule it out by saying "yeah thats what these crazy people say to not seem crazy"

          If this post truly was downvote botted, there's no fucking way in hell it would have made /all or have had the upvote percentage that it does. I'm not disputing the existence of downvote bots, just your proclamation that this post was a victim of it.

          If a select group had a vested interest in masking the visibility of this post, they easily could have done so.

           I never said this post got botted, just that the possibility exists, it also seemed really weird because there was a lot of downvotes in a really short time, maybe its just coincidence, maybe there was someone who botted it and backed off as soon as people realized or thought the damage done was enough
          </p>
          <p>
           who really knows, but saying its what conspiracy theorists tell people to avoid the truth that they're wrong isn't a legit reason
          </p>
          <p>
           oh and just so you know, I'm not 100% on board with the whole pizzagate movement, but there are definitely some weird connections that got my interest

       I agree with you. However, downvote and psychological manipulation certainly occurs with groups like Correct the Record at hand.

        But the basic fact of their existence doesn't nearly justify how much the accusation is thrown around. Astroturfing exists, but it exists a) because people like me already genuinely believe stuff like "Hillary Clinton was probably just ordering lunch," which is how it gets funded and b) to make it so other people inculcate those points of view and spread them further.

         Yes I agree. You also agree that these underhanded methods do exist. I did not claim that "the basic fact of their existence doesn't nearly justify how much the accusation is thrown around". The quantity of the number of times an accusation is made is not an argument at all, it is not falsifiable, I cannot check that claim, I cannot know the extent to which this phenomenon exists.
        </p>
        <p>
         So if we cannot objectively verify these claims of astroturfing (because that is the nature of the phenomenon), how do we know what is true? We don't. But we also don't know what is "not-true". Occam's Razor says that "it's probably nothing" is probably correct. But, because of the stakes here, "probably" is not good enough. That's why a lot of the people here are so "conspiratorial" so to speak; lives could be at stake. So you're probably right, but your probability is not certainty. I hope I am making sense to you.

         <p>
          If we're talking about figuring out what's true, the astroturfing thing is mostly an ad hominem to skip that bit. Like, what's the difference between discerning truth in a statement from a paid shill or a bot, a person who read that bot/shill's statement and believed it, the person running the bot, or the person who just honestly came by a beliefset if the statement is the same for all of them?
         </p>
         <p>
          And as far as the stakes bit, I think you need to do a lot more to establish those stakes as anything but a ludicrous stretch by people gathered to demonize someone before you can rely on them. You can't point to how potentially serious an alien invasion would be to justify people thinking it's happening because they saw a meteor shower.

      It's really naive to think that interested powerful parties don't have media control. CTR isn't a myth, and that's the one that admits what they do.

     There is definitely some up voting down voting going on. I saw it too. Thing is, since the election I've noticed a great deal of other subreddits that usually don't get upvoted or down voted are at 0 or negative numbers. I wonder if there are bots at work to simply down vote. Perhaps let loose before the election and are just still going. I could be wrong.

      Obviously damning...and we need obvious. What's damning in and of itself is that a "normal" family was under surveillance, had their calls monitored, and archived..and then leaked to wikileaks.

     That's the way the scores on Reddit work mate, they're fuzzy so that people trying to to manipulate voting don't actually know if it's working or not (or something to that effect)

     This whole thing seems like a giant conspricy theory based on really loose interpretations of things.

     It's kind of funny for people to get on here and scream about how this just ruins the credibility of any number of things from this sub to wikileaks itself and yet I bet if you could go back far enough with one of them, you'd see them commenting about how awesome the fappening is.

      the file maddie-mccain-pj-report-2008.pdf is not in Italian, I think it's Portuguese.

       Makes sense...her abduction was in Portugal. Is it a legal document?

       Yes, it's Portuguese. It looks like a statement from Federal Police. I read Portuguese well enough to basically understand the document. It is context for the disappearance and investigation.

        It seems the final report of the investigation.

         The report mentions trafficking, child sex rings, the occult, organ harvesting, and adoption as possible explanations.

         Not federal not national. Its our judiciaria (justice) police who's job it to conduct every and any investigation regarding serious crime: drug trafficking,  homicides, money laundering schemes, etc. We, portuguese, lived trough this case at that time. This document seams to be advanced, long after the mediatism fainted - already mentions a lot of past investigation, PJ and Uk counterpart cooperation and forwards all that information to a judge. I am really surprise to know about this document from wikileaks. Right now i cant but i may look deep into this document after. Can you explain me how is this related to pizzagate?

       Wait...these reports were just discovered?  So the reason she was talked about in connection with the podestas was purely the mug shots and not this?

         Not much, it's about the Gonçalo Amaral trial.  He was sued by the McCanns because he published a book saying that the McCanns were responsible for the disappearance of the child.
         <br/>
         Gonçalo Amaral was a detective on the McCann case.

      Portuguese here.
     </p>
     <p>
      Well, this document (https://file.wikileaks.org/file/carter-ruck-mccann.pdf) is nothing else than a release of the report about the judicial decision regarding Amaral's books (where he presents several "proofs" he collected while officially investigating the case; the case was then handed to British investigators. He eventually claims that the McCains had killed their daughter on the apartment they rented.) It states that the book is denying the rights of maddie's brothers and parents to a private life free of unjust defamation, and as such the remaining copies should be destroyed, and Amaral silenced; despite that, it also admits that the book is widely available in the internet, and by the time of the legal decision the book was on it's 4th edition, and had translated versions in multiple languages.)
     </p>
     <p>
      This was the whole premise of Amaral, I remember watching the documentary someone posted here in live television, one or two years after the disappearance of Maddy. At those times there was an avid debate in Portugal about the meddling of british in this particular affair, which just fired up the idea that Amaral could be on the right path to the truth)

      The Pj report 2008.pdf, on other hand, is kind of the formal account of procedure with which the PJ conducted the investigations, who they interrogated and why, and the deconstruction of several leads that they received, claiming that the media coverage and tempering of the crime scene by the parents and the group were focal points on why the investigation went astray, and even go as long as to point out several incongruences in Maddie's parents testemonies(watch the documentary). While I will not translate it fully, I can pass on some of the more vital information, such as the possibilities our police has considered (exposed on page 6):
     </p>
     <p>
      1- kidnapping without homicide (to either sexual, minor, or organ traffic)
2- kidnapping and homicide, with the concealment or not of the body
3- accidental death followed by the concealment of the corpse (Which is what Amaral defended)
4- disappearance due to negligence.
     </p>
     <p>
      These were the hypotheses posed by PJ to conduct the investigation. A brief search of the names in bold will show why are they involved, so if you want to know it's easier to search the names by yourself than expecting me to translate it (most of it is circumstantial and would be a pointless job). Robert Murat, though, was the prime suspect for a long time (or so it seems, according to the document)
     </p>
     <p>
      Check the documentary for yourselves, it's pretty self-explanatory and refrains heavily to that document.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another thing I would like to include here, although, and I need to caps this, I HAVE NO SOURCE FOR WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY, I remember reading about a supposed meeting between Maddie's parents and a supposed pedophile living at the time in the area where they spent their vacations. If anyone can either provide a source to this or disprove it, I would appreciate it. (could it be Murat?)
     </p>
     <p>
      Edit: Have in mind watching the documentary that this was not the doing of an conspiracy looney youtuber (despite the awful awful editing), but rather a production made by TVI, a private channel that while being pretty general, isn't prone to fire up conspiracy theories, and is widely accepted as a trustworthy information outlet in Portugal. And also, that Amaral isn't any lunatic with wild claims, but the chief investigator in the case, from Portugal's PJ, who put his career on the line by making the book and the documentary.

       It was Clement Freud. He owns the resort or Villa they went to.

         If somehow Clement can be linked to anything Podesta/Clinton related, that would be golden.

      the file maddie-mccian-pj-report-2008 is indeed in Portuguese. I read it last night and is the police report on the maddie case in which they conclude they cant objectively tell what happened.
      <br/>
      The other file posted down in this thread has something to do with the fact that the man leading the investigation wrote a book in which his thesis was something in the lines of the parents being the culprits, which was proved not to be the case in the investigation which he shouldnt be allowed to discuss.

          Ciao tartaruganinja, anche io parlo italiano, ma non è la mia lingua natale. Io ho ascoltato il audio, ma la qualità non e molto buona, non è vero? Nel ùltimo audio parla de divorzio e de asunti legali de la donna. Ho ascoltato che parlano de bambini e del fatto che aparentemente non è possibile per l'uomo de vedere i bambini...
         </p>
         <p>
          Ancora è notte per me... non voglio ascoltare tutte le audi oggi, voglio dormire. Ho anche eliminato il archivo... non so si veramente sia evidenza contundente.... ma comunque credo che non e veramente relazionata a Podesta o Comet Pizza. Non ho ascoltato niente de relazione sessuale con bambini o adulti... mi sembra una conversazione banale... non mi sembra evidenza di niente.
         </p>
         <p>
          Magari questo caso PizzaGate é solo il cominzio... il abuso a bambini è una realità... tutto il mondo lo sai, ma comme è possibile de implicare a Podesta/Alefantis/CometPizza ? Non è facile... e loro hanno tutta la protezione di Clinton e il governo... mi sembra che non arrivaremo a niente :(
         </p>
         <p>
          ciao... buona notte... !

            Hi there... I'm saying that I also speak Italian (although spanish is my native language). I've heard pieces of the audio... yes... the quality could be better... it seems that the woman is getting a divorce... they are talking about the legal procedures... rules etc... the fact that aparrently they can't see the children... they talk about a psychiatrist... 
I didn't even finish a single audio because it's frankly boring... not incriminating at all... it seems like a random conversation... the tone and wording of the woman does not make you think she is a child trafficker or anything like that... I didn't hear anything at all about sex. 
I don't see how this could be important or relevant... perphaps I'm wrong....  It's late now... im going to sleep. If tartruganinja doesn't give you a summary of the whole audios... I'll listen to them tomorrow and post a summary of them....

           Ciao Pizzagate,
          </p>
          <p>
           Scusa se non uso gli accenti ma ho una tastiera Nord Americana e quindi senza accenti.
          </p>
          <p>
           La qualita' dell'audio non e' fantastica, si capisce per la maggior parte della conversazione ma il modo in cui parla la ragazza mi ha creato piu' problemi perche' fa discorsi un po' sconnessi e si mangia le parole.
          </p>
          <p>
           Anche io non ho trovato alcun riferimento all'indagine del Pizzagate. Magari il mio sforzo non e' servito a niente.
Capisco la tua frustrazione,
pero' bisogna pur sempre iniziare da qualche parte :)
          </p>
          <p>
           Ma la tua lingua natale e' lo spagnolo per caso? Comunque, scrivi italiano molto bene a parte qualche piccolo errore.
          </p>
          <p>
           Buona notte a te!

            I'm Italian and have been following this thread for some hours now, but I haven't had the time to help all day. I'll get on it as soon as I get home (7/8 hours though, plus the audios are quite long).
           </p>
           <p>
            What I can say now is that both users who tried translating this far said they haven't recognized  anything too suspicious.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT: Nevermind it's solved.

           Copied from tartaruganinja's reply below:
          </p>
          <p>
           First 5 minutes of the 8th of May phone call. The audio is not great and some words are not understandable at all . It seems like they are talking about a guy named Simon, I think, who worked at JCB?!
          </p>
          <p>
           W1: Hello?
          </p>
          <p>
           W2: Hello, ciao mamma ciao
          </p>
          <p>
           W1: Can you talk?
          </p>
          <p>
           W2: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes...really you don't have to worry...everything's relatively OK here
          </p>
          <p>
           W1: Relatively? What happened?
          </p>
          <p>
           W2:Simon is a bit anxious...hmm
          </p>
          <p>
           W1: Yes
          </p>
          <p>
           W2: Aaaaand anxious, but he wouldn't talk, I can never understand what's up. And the last weekend I again had the impression that he was looking for something, he kept searching to change job...I couldn't understand really. Then Saturday he left saying he rented a cottage and that he's gonna move there and that he feels very anxious he doesn't feel very well, and I did notice that he wasn't feeling fine but you can never tell...anyways he's not aggressive or anything, I mean I can tell he's not fine but...aaaand...
          </p>
          <p>
           W1: So he's moving?
          </p>
          <p>
           W2: Yeah he's moving, he says he might go just on the weekends just so he can have a place to go if he doesn't feel very well so he can find some peace, and then he said that he's always available to come here when I work to stay with the kids and for that thing, it could also be ok, I mean things are how they are...
          </p>
          <p>
           W1: The more you **** (can't tell what she says) the better
          </p>
          <p>
           W2: Yeah right right right, it's a bit sad but in the end it's a practical solution...I was just worried about the fact that he was nervous, and also him searching a new job place didn't make lot of sense...unless something happened to him but he didn't say anything...so yeah... ****(can't tell what she says and who she's talking about) he stayed a bit here and then he went to sleep there, then he came back here and then he went back there in the afternoon and then he came back here to eat...there was a time he would go to this place where....so he would go back and forth but after all everything was fine hmm... and then yesterday night he says “I'm leaving and I'll see you tomorrow if I get back for dinner etc” and I say “All right” and then he calls me 20 minutes later and I asked him “Are you already there?” because I'm not quite sure where this place is, maybe it's close but...eh...and he says “Yes yes yes I'm there...I wanted to tell you something because...hmm” and I said “I don't understand what is going on, if you're leaving definitively or if you're doing back and forth” and he says “No no it's just so I can have some space” Well fine...as he wishes....and then he says “ I have to make you understand what is going on. Somebody sent an anonymous letter to JCB where I work saying and explaining that I was arrested and I got a suspended sentence...” I mean I didn't know this, I learned this yesterday night
          </p>
          <p>
           W1: I swear too, I believed you withdrew the charges....
           <strong>
            *
           </strong>
           *since it was a partial complaint (can't tell what she's saying)
          </p>
          <p>
           W2: Exactly Exactly...I thought yes yes...
          </p>
          <p>
           W1: I believed that since you pressed charges, it was over for him.
          </p>
          <p>
           W2: Indeed! I thought I didn't tell you anything about it, I thought I was silent about this part... I don't remember anymore, I know it was a while ago but now that you make me notice it...
          </p>
          <p>
           W1: I didn't know...I believed you..
          </p>
          <p>
           W2: Yeah but I didn't even think for a second he could be him...honestly not at all, I asked you and maybe I shouldn't have asked but...
          </p>
          <p>
           W1: And then you say “the world is full of crazy people”
          </p>
          <p>
           W2: Yeah yeah yeah yeah
          </p>
          <p>
           W1: I talked about these things to uncle Ranieri and obviously with uncle Roberto...but I didn't talk about it with anybody else.
          </p>
          <p>
           W2: No no no right
          </p>
          <p>
           W1: And then, who knows... Giorgio could go crazy too, uncle Ranieri could go crazy ...they can't know that...
          </p>
          <p>
           W2: And I didn't know too and even if I had told you more I couldn't have been able to tell you because I didn't know, he didn't tell me...I thought he was absolved I mean he told me that he was “BOUND” (?!?) which means that for an year you can't... like you can't even get caught littering on the grass...and I thought everything was over and then yesterday night he told me that his sentence was suspended and if he had to do something illegal he would go to jail immediately...but I didn't know it so even if I had told you more I couldn't have been able to because I didn't know...

     We obv need multiple translators to corroborate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Also if you want it professionally done (for any anons who are ballin) you can use http://Rev.com, they offer translation services and it's not cheap.

     If you upload it to youtube and work from the auto-translated files (which you can download), it will make your work much easier and faster.

       As far as I can see those are from previous wikileaks releases, not Podesta emails. Still very interesting though. Check out this summary https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Suppressed_Madeleine_Foundation_leaflet,_2009

        I think the key thing...is WHY are they are on wikileaks at all. I'm fairly certain...people don't upload meaningless shit to WIKILEAKS...and wikileaks does not waste their time, money, and energy releasing meaningless shit. It's a puzzle...and expecting wikileaks to put it together for us is ridiculous.

         Completely agree. Though the fact they were being suppressed is probably enough for wikileaks to deem them worthy of hosting. We still need an explanation on the Podesta sketch thing big time.

          I'm guessing there's more to this. It is illogical to think time was wasted on ordinary housewives.  It is of interest these are bundled with the Portuguese PDFs...and the blonde child who does not speak. Could be a child was stashed among a family for a while.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am open to this being nothing...but it is illogical to assume that it is. We are making a few assumptions that may not be true, especially that the conversations took place IN Italy. Supposing this has to do with MM...it is a very long exposed trip from Portugal to Italy...when the entire world was hunting...even a trip to a private plane would have been risky. I'd wonder if it was a common safe house IN Portugal..and Italian was incidental to the inhabitants. Just thinking outside the box.

       That's what I wanna know. Doesn't matter if the content seems normal, if these are Clinton associates emailing each other extensively about the McCann case, that's significant.

        If you want to know, why didn't you google for even one second, you wouldve seen that this is way older than Clinton's leaks, and has nothing to do with her.

           <p>
            And he talks about using android phone data to estimate voting patterns of different regions and target those who don't "vote right" accordingly.

and the information we have to offer.

             He's referencing
             <strong>
              VOLUNTEERS
             </strong>
             using smart phones to upload data in real time about voters they encounter in person. It specifically even mentions at the end that this could be done with either "on android or iphone." Meaning Google is not doing anything within its ownership of android to power this data, because apple is equally useful to their process.

             You mean campaigning? Because this is campaigning. They're identifying individuals within a population that, based on demographic data, should be more likely to vote for your candidate, but aren't. This isn't achieved by data-mining their smart phone, but by their personal digital profile which is entirely
             <strong>
              public information
             </strong>
             . Then, volunteers may reach out to these individuals in
             <strong>
              public platforms
             </strong>
             to offer information that could sway them to their side.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not to mention that none of the incorrect statements you made would render Google a compromised source of information, which is what I was responding to in the first place.

   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Release date: December 12, 2008
    </p>
    <p>
     Summary: The material presents around three hours of Italian telephone recordings between older and younger women, claiming to be from from mid April to mid May 2008. A few calls reveal the number called via tone dialing (DTMF), the decoding of which may be a possible avenue for further investigation. The source provided the material without additional context, and we ask Italian speakers to investigate.

       a theory is that it's a trap to get frog posters to DL it so that their hard drives become a target for law enforcement.  Could have been planted by DNC.  Once it's on your computer, the folder name is very incriminating even after you delete it.

        If they were released in 2008 they have nothing to do with the DNC or Podesta leaks.

        Ever heard of file deletion scrambling? Even when I do boot in Win7 (I don't since after the June patches, after that it's impossible to prevent it to turn into win10 under the hood). It's possible to put back all options like they are in win7 but it's a massive headache, so I made an image of it (my win7 x64 ultimate partition) and open it in Vbox... even my not-so-great-but-okay-cleaningware in there Registry Mechanic has a file deleter that scrambles all the data making it near impossible to retrieve (I've tried with about 10 data recovering software and yep, not even Testdisk sees my empty deleted and shredded txt's.

       /r/hillaryforprison and /r/conspiracy had a severely autistic love child. They're digging through wikileaks and whatnot trying to piece together a DNC child kidnapping/sex/murder/witchcraft conspiracy. The code word is PIZZA.

       Wikileaks released hacked emails from Podesta.
      </p>
      <p>
       Little internet detectives with lots of free time and wild imaginations claim that any email that references "pizza" refers to a child prostitution ring.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP found some audio clips in the dump and hyped it up. Someone who speaks Italian translated the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds like it's just a very personal conversation about someone not being well and they were concerned about him.

         You're proving my point. Yet another far reaching assumption that is a cornerstone of the argument.
        </p>
        <p>
         If we can absolutely and unquestionably prove the sketches are not the kids, the conspiracy loons will fill that hole in their case with another assumption and completely ignore all the wrong assumptions they built their case around.
        </p>
        <p>
         Being smart isn't just digging and digging and digging and knowing how to dig. Being smart is also about knowing when your argument is no longer valid and willing to admit your hypothesis is incorrect.
        </p>
        <p>
         The pizzagate conspiracy is a house of cards and this sub is too naive to realize it. When one card at the base gets blown away, you've got 10 theorists ready to lob anything to fill its space. The only people who don't realize this are those who are so enthralled and obsessed with all the new cards being stacked on top that they have tunnel vision.

           That's not how investigations work in any sane criminal system on earth. That's not how the scientific process works.
          </p>
          <p>
           Conspiracy theorists get rightly labelled nut jobs precisely because their benchmark for truth is if something "can't be disproved," rather than if there is any basis of proof positive.

            Criminal investigations work exactly like this. What are you talking about.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is plenty of evidence here to warrent a closer look.
           </p>
           <p>
            Making a decision either way is moronic.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are all innocent until proven guilty, but you act like we can not investigate until we have a smoking gun... Which is absurd.
           </p>
           <p>
            Conspiracy theroists are nut jobs. We get it. Debate the facts.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have yet to see you make one post discussing the facts of this investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you think law enforcment just goes "this is crazy, your crazy, go away"...
           </p>
           <p>
            No they say: this doesnt add up because of a, b, c.
           </p>
           <p>
            So please, breakdown the evidence and tell me why its NOT something worth looking into.

           </p>
           <p>
            You need to prove negatives also.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything isnt assumed negative in science.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is assumed UNKOWN. You need to prove either a positive or a negative claim.

             You don't need to prove negatives that only exist as the opposite to an absurd positive. The classic example is that you can't disprove the tea kettle in outer space, but that doesn't make it real. As has been displayed time and again, this entire sub exists to investigate that tea kettle, because that tea kettle makes Hillary Clinton look bad, and damn it, that still matters!

           "OH MY GOD PEDES this is it! How the fuck did we miss this crucial piece of information that will link Podesta to a world elite child prostitution ring?! MSM won't cover this so never trust them again! They want this buried... spread spread spread!" Is a fine example of how

           turn harmless investigating into problematic investigating that does "hurt shit."

            I do agree all their rushing to judgment hurts the investigation. And COULD lead to something damaging. But it hasnt yet and that has nothing to do with investigating it.

             You really don't understand that spreading misinformation or passing assumptions on as truth has very negative consequences? You don't understand that personally identifying people and accusing them for things there is no real evidence of them doing is damaging? Think beyond yourself and try to imagine people are accusing you for being in a child prostitution ring because you sent an email that got hacked with a reference to getting pizza and playing ping pong. I guess you wouldn't mind if your family, boss, spouse, or friends found out there are thousands of people who truly believe you fuck little kids?
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you remember the Boston marathon bombing and how the Reddit conspiracy arm-chair detectives inflicted major damage in their quest for the truth (TM).

             I know my younger brother voted for trump after the spiritual cooking thing started spreading around. That was his kicker. You really think he was the only one who fell for that shit (or any of the other shit spewing from armpits of society) and voted accordingly? Come on...

         Some emails + some photos from instagram are suspiscious. But yeah, there are no real evidences so far.

          No, I completely believe in a pedophile ring tied to Podesta as well as many other high ranking government officials across the world.
         </p>
         <p>
          However, this infographic is horribly unconvincing. It uses a 4chan screencap as a source for pedophilia-related lingo and those instagram photos are all pretty normal besides the kid being duct taped. I don't even see the relation from the Comet logo an the pedophilia symbol. They're radically different.
         </p>
         <p>
          The only mildly damning evidence is in the emails as far as this infographic says.

       IMHO it looks like an all out attack against pizzagate using false information planted in wikileaks and then followed up with every shill tactic in the book targetting the success made with the maddy case tieing up the whole thing in a massive fail that they are trying to put all over reddit.  maybe im wrong.

     A bunch of rednecks who voted for Trump continue digging through Wikileaks in desperate attempts to discredit the Democratic party and think any mention of pizza refers to child prostitution.

      Why would people be trying to discredit the DNC when Trump is in office? Seems like people genuinely interested in exposing some pedophiles to me, I don't doubt that politics could be playing a factor in some peoples motivations but I've seen plenty of anti Trump rhetoric from people throughout the pizzagate investigations. As someone said before we should probably leave the politics out of this and while it may seem like a big joke to some imagine if this digging does truly uncover some nefarious plans, it would all be worth it in the end to help the children.

      Or people were horrified by the obvious FEC laws violated blatantly and have totally lost trust in the system.  The DC pizza place was WEIRD.  Labeled family friendly with a bunch of naked pics and a concrete room with nothing in it.  Overwhelmingly we have lost trust that there isn't weird shady stuff going on in DC.  Also it feels as if law enforcement can't prosecute because the DOJ doesn't benefit.  Maybe totally wrong.

      I wonder what they'll do if wikileaks ever releases the inevitable mountain of shit there has to be floating about trump? Obvious they won't do that while they're in russias pocket, but it'd be interesting.

       That's the weird thing about the whole thing. Wikileaks was supposed to be unbiased and neutral yet so far they haven't really said anything about Trump and have only focused on Hillary's campaign.

    Just found this thread. I think this links up strangely to a thread I posted here: https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cz2x5/an_overlooked_email/
   </p>
   <p>
    In an email to John Podesta, an Italian reporter titles an email "Puttanesca sauce - we'd like to taste it".
   </p>
   <p>
    In the signature of that email are two locations with abbreviations "p.zza", Italian short-hand for "square". Awfully similar to pizza.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Is there an Italian "square" that links this all together? Is that the headquarters for this human trafficking ring? It's no secret that the Italian mafia low-key runs the country. Are they at the center of this?
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Great find. I truly hope we can find someone to translate.

      There have been a handful of Italian politicians arrested for human trafficking of hundreds of children and only receiving 3-12 years in prison. I don't know much about the authors of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking_in_Italy">
       this article
      </a>
      , but it doesn't seem unlikely that a country with a major organized crime problem would be a center for human trafficking.

       Supposition and speculation aren't evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human trafficking is not the same thing as organised paedophile rings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most organised paedophilia is actually forcing underage but nevertheless nubile girls into prostitution; but when the phrase 'paedophile ring' is used, it usually means and is understood to mean people abusing children for their own gratification.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of these things are acceptable,
       <em>
        of course
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       But here in the UK we've had this 'rich and influential men ritually and habitually practising sexual abuse of children and even killing them - OMG the whole political class is preying on our young ones' etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out it's entirely down to the fantastical allegations of a pathological liar, a policy of 'always believing the accuser', and a bunch of gullible police officers.

         Look.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was there, in the 1970s and the 1980s. To suggest that Savile had any pull with no. 10 is fatuous. The only reason Thatcher ever met him was because he raised millions for charity. That's one of the governments jobs: to recognise things like charitable efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
         Having been photographed with Thatcher probably helped to stifle the responses of people who should have listened more sympathetically to complaints about Savile. That's bad. But unless you knew him personally, Savile just seemed a bit weird. No. 10 had no reason to exclude him from recognition for his efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
         Did Savile claim he was huge mates with Thatcher? Probably. Does Noel Edmonds claim the universe gave him his career-saving job with
         <em>
          Deal or no deal
         </em>
         because he asked it nicely? Yes. Do we believe either of them? Not unless we're stupid.
        </p>
        <p>
         Everybody needs to remember that no paedophile presents himself as a paedophile 100% of the time. If a paedophile thinks he's dealing with someone who's not likely to be sympathetic, then he's not going to reveal himself as someone engaged in criminal endeavours. And yet - if he thinks he has an opportunity to ingratiate himself with royalty, he may well do so without 'tipping his hand'.
        </p>
        <p>
         Did Andrew do something nauseating? I don't know. But the only known allegation against him concerns a 17 year old girl. Not even underage according to UK law. Now, that's not the only issue - if she was forced, or coerced, then that's still wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
         But it's ridiculous to drag out Prince Andrew in the context of the allegations of a paedophile sex ring operating out of the house of commons, which is - fairly obviously I would have thought - what I was referring to.

           The Dickens dossier was a mysterious object; it reminds me of King Lear's ranting:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            "I will do such things— what they are yet I know not, but they shall be the terrors of the earth..."
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Dickens gave the dossier to Brittan. An enquiry showed that the Home Office reviewed the file and passed parts of it to the Met. Beyond that, all we have is hand-waving and bluster on Dickens' part. He didn't even tell his son what was in it - only made vague claims of significance. We don't know who his informants were, or how he compiled the dossier -
           <strong>
            no-one has come forward
           </strong>
           to say that they spoke to Dickens. It was nearly 40 years ago so the fact that it's not immediately possible to determine what happened to it isn't at all suspicious. He's supposed to have handed it over in 1983 (I think) but in the more-than-ten years before he died, he never pursued the matter even though he remained an MP, and had originally named someone on the floor of the house.
          </p>
          <p>
           That person was a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange which means Dickens' assertions about him were hardly wondrous.
          </p>
          <p>
           I'm a lawyer, and I regularly deal with people making unsupported allegations. I was looking at a file today, reading a witness statement in which searing allegations of financial impropriety and family violence were made.
          </p>
          <p>
           It's all bullshit. I know it's bullshit, because the witness' lawyers would have produced the supporting evidence if they had it, and they didn't. The reports allegedly made 6, 7 years ago to HMRC of wholesale VAT and income tax fraud were either i) never made or ii) HMRC didn't follow them up (unlikely) or iii) HMRC carried out an investigation and decided there was no evidence of wrongdoing.
          </p>
          <p>
           The allegations of bullying mum into lending money, of taking gold from dad, of being listed on 'the police computer' as a 'violent troublemaker' are all bullshit.
          </p>
          <p>
           ANYBODY CAN MAKE ALLEGATIONS. ABOUT ANYTHING. AT ANY TIME. IT'S APPARENTLY NOT HARD EVEN TO FOOL THE POLICE (see Lord Justice Henriques' report of last week.)
          </p>
          <p>
           It's not unusual for lots of people to be making allegations at about the same time, so there's nothing significant about that either.
          </p>
          <p>
           It's like the 9/11 conspiracy theorists: the size and complexity of the conspiracy that is alleged should tell most people that the probability of it being successful is minuscule.
          </p>
          <p>
           It would be absolutely impossible for the sort of conspiracies you referred to being successfully kept secret for decades - even in the face of police enquiries.
          </p>
          <p>
           None of this, of course, will convince you. But maybe  some redditors reading will realise that there is another viable point of view.

     I researched the Puttanesca thing last night and here's what I found:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Spaghetti alla puttanesca" is a popular Italian dish, but the term "puttanesca" itself literally means "prostitute", or roughly, "Spaghetti, prostitute style".
    </p>
    <p>
     The Italian news article attached to that email mentions John Podesta at the very end. The passage roughly translates to "Meanwhile, campaign manager John Podesa is trying out a new strategy: serving spaghetti alla puttanesca to journalists."
    </p>
    <p>
     Now sure, maybe this Italian journalist just RANDOMLY chose to write "alla puttanesca" as opposed to any other pasta dish...
    </p>
    <p>
     Then again, google "Berlusconi puttanesca" and you'll see that this is a well-established pun for Italian speakers. Berlusconi was caught up in multiple sex scandals relating to drug fueled "bunga bunga" hooker parties for his elite friends, some of which featured underage (15-16 y/o) prostitutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are countless articles in Italian news referring to Berlusconi's rule as "politics alla puttanesca" - which would lead me to believe that MAYBE this journalist is winking rather blatantly at his audience...the implication being that John Podesta is throwing hooker sex parties for journalists, to ensure their loyalty to Clinton in the 2016 election.
    </p>
    <p>
     With all that in mind, why did this Italian bloke forward that article to Podesta with the subject "Fwd: Your puttanesca sauce - we'd like to sample it", and no text body?
    </p>
    <p>
     FWIW, I have no doubt that John Podesta can cook a mean spaghetti alla puttanesca - but is that REALLY what this email is about, given the cultural context of the term?
    </p>
    <p>
     BTW, Berlusconi was a member of the illegal and overtly fascist P2 freemasonic lodge run by Licio Gelli in the 1970s-80s.

      You know, it doesn't look like much more than hes hiring hookers to buy over the press. It looks pretty much exactly like that.

       Great work. Thanks!  I had looked into that email a few days ago but got lost in the fog.  I did find that puttescana appears in the film Lemity Snicket -- where three orphans cook it for a dude. 
The whole thing, once again, has twisted overtones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I looked into another Podesta email where a visit to an ancient glass blowing factory in Venice was mentioned in a weird way.  I researched this particular business and it goes all the way back to the fourteenth century.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, nothing of substance but perhaps another seemingly disconnected dot that might actually amount to something.
      </p>
      <p>
       One last thing - an email from Wendy Abrams has an attached picture with her in front of a theatre named Podesta. And then a back and forth with john is odd.

      Maybe this is weird of me, but if it were actually proven that Podesta was buying hookers to bribe the press with honeypots, I'd lose respect for the press rather than Podesta.  Podesta would still look sleazy, but he looks so sleazy right now that this would constitute a reduction of expected sleaze levels.

      Yes, when I think about that, I'm certain it's weird of me to think that.  I'm not of the opinion that prostitution should be illegal in the first place.  I know that's an unusual position.  W/e, it's my two cents.

     "Piazza" = "Plaza" in English, not "Pizza"

       Italian translation. Piazza = square, as in a town square.

      I understand, but these guys seem to use layers and layers of symbols. It's just a possible origin for the metaphor of pizza to whatever pedo connotation.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the headquarters for these trafficked kids comes from a place called "P.zza de la Whatever", you can imagine how someone from an English-speaking background could come up with calling it "pizza".

       I'm willing to entertain the idea, but it's a stretch. Keep in mind we ultimately have to convince the general public about this. While it might look like a tenuous connection to you or me, most will view us as crazy people grasping at straws. We don't want to dilute the stronger evidence with things like this.

      It's possible, but the specific verbiage of the title just seems a little sketchy. "Puttanesca suace" translates to something like "Spaghetti in the style of a whore."
     </p>
     <p>
      There's also an
      <a href="http://imgur.com/a/ec2OL">
       image attached to that email
      </a>
      . It looks like a glitchy screenshot of an iPhone, which seems weird because I've never seen a screenshot corrupt like that. Apple is pretty neurotic about that stuff.
     </p>
     <p>
      People are wondering if there is steganographic work (i.e. embedding communication in an image file). I don't have the technical knowledge to figure that out, but it would be great if someone more knowledgeable could share a perspective.

       Encrypted file, embedded in jpeg file. Theres some tool for that, too.
Make a screenshot on iphone, does the size of a file match or similar?

       That image file doesn't have an IEND at the end of it - or anywhere in the middle of it for that matter.  It looks like it was improperly truncated.  If it's hiding a steganographic secret, the rest of the data was probably spanned out across another file, to be restored by someone who knows how to chunk the PNG back together.

      I was speculating maybe a little too wildly. We'd just need more evidence to think that.
     </p>
     <p>
      That said, I don't think it's unlikely that a country with major organized crime problems would be a center for human trafficking.

    Based on the fact that the title is so damning, the translations haven't shown anything damning, and it's starting to seem like JA is MIA, could this be a red herring.

     Theory is they named the files to get picked up by anti pedophilia measures on windows and Mac so they could find out who downloaded the files

      I'm not really sure how I'm supposed to answer this and I may be wrong but you seem more intense about this situation than I'm willing to entertain.

    since u/tartaruganinja already translated the 11april2008.wav file, I'll do the next one, 15july2008.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'll try to summarize to keep it short.
   </p>
   <p>
    Same 2 people, W1 and W2, talking, mother and daughter.
   </p>
   <p>
    W2 and husband had some corrispondence trough her lawyers, 5-6 letters about a 5k£ loan he made to her in '95, after selling some stocks, about coming back home to search for a purple cable (???), and about a divorce injuction he sent.
   </p>
   <p>
    W2: Divorce is about to begin and settle the monetary conditions will be a struggle. Also Simon's company announced is going to cut 4-500 workers, they used to work a lot in the building industry and it's all shut down right now. He's one of the last hires and he's out of his mind...
    <em>
     she thinks he's going to get fired
    </em>
    . That also explains why he's backpedaling on a lot of things, including waiting for our son to be 18 before selling the house, he needs the money (or he's acting up, I don't know). In his conditions, he will struggle to find another job.
   </p>
   <p>
    W2: he called my sister in law, he was nice at first but after that he started insulting, angry about what happened ("Are you happy now..."). He asked for David to come to the telephone but he refused, and my sister in law hung up. She think he was intoxicated because he was not talking very well at all, so he looked completely drunk.
   </p>
   <p>
    W2: my lawyer asked about the kids, if they are happy with the father, reading his letters he thinks he [Simon] is nuts.
    <em>
     W1 and W2 proceed to talk about the kids and their situation
    </em>
   </p>

     <em>
      talking about how to talk to the children about the subject of not seeing their father
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      now W1 starts talking, but she's mumbling and it's really hard to understand
     </em>
     [also, they talk about known facts using pronouns, and in italian there's not always the gender specifications when talking in third person, so i'm trying to stay neutral and specify only when they do]
    </p>
    <p>
     W1: You talked to me about Nicky and [???] are... right? He/She was not like that, in the beginning... he was not giving that impression.
    </p>
    <p>
     W2: no no no, maybe it's because he/she started seeing...
    </p>
    <p>
     W1: yeah, maybe he's saying something to her... you won't know anything from Nicky, you know. Don't forget what happened when that thing with the..., the... blew up, he was the one crying like a calf. He/She's more sensible than the others.
    </p>
    <p>
     W2: yes, yes, he overthinks a lot
    </p>
    <p>
     W1: exactly, that's his attitude. And the fact that at first he was... I won't say relieved, but he looked calm, for example when we were there, only one morning he was a bit in distress...
     <em>
      W1 keeps saying yes and covers half of what the mother says
     </em>
     . After that, when he came back... but there was the whole thing, like the little brother staying home, you weren't there... and he's sensible. But the other days, when he was coming back home [from school? I don't get it] he looked fine, smiling, eating and playing with his friend for a couple hours. He was calm. When  he was going to bed in 5 minutes he was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     W2: yeah, but he's not like he's freaked out, but he's more silent like he's overthinking something.
    </p>
    <p>
     W1: but if he's... sick... [back to Simon i guess]
    </p>
    <p>
     W2: no no, he's totally out of control
    </p>
    <p>
     W1: something I would like to kill him... but he's a sick person
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      again with the lawyers and the letters about divorce, they are kind of jumping subjects. They need to settle things like who keeps the house or the judge will settle it, but he's not using a lawyer so things are a but up in the air atm
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Other talks about divorce, she talks about changing the key of the door, then again the letters he sent, and the possible outcomes of the divorce and the house value, who keeps the cash and who will continue to pay the house loan.

      <em>
       still talks about money, buying another house
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      W1: The important thing is the relationship between father and sons. It's not about getting them against him (that's a boomerang). If he was a normal person, it would be easy. The problem is they are spending hours with a sick/insane person.
     </p>
     <p>
      W2: yeah, the last phone call with the stepsister... he's having a crysis/an episode...
     </p>
     <p>
      W1: he's the father, the problem is that he has a certain influence over them.
     </p>
     <p>
      ...
     </p>
     <p>
      W2: that's why i'm concerned about this vacation. 2 whole weeks, down there... if I ask them to keep their cellphone up they won't keep it on, saying there are no problems... I don't want them to go with the father without the cellphone on.
     </p>
     <p>
      W1: I don't know what to say to you...
     </p>
     <p>
      W2: I know, it was better if he was cheating on me. With him you don't know what he's going to do.
     </p>
     <p>
      W1: Could you talk about the childern with your father in law? Tell him about your concerns, because he's not well... Do you really have to let him take them to Cornwall these 15 days? ... It's always not right to alarm the children.
     </p>
     <p>
      W2: yeah but they are really far down there, anything could happen. They closed our case [the social services], but with these new worrying signals, they might talk to the father in law, but this would angry Simon very much.
     </p>
     <p>
      W1: but are the kids happy about the vacation?
     </p>
     <p>
      W2: I think they are fine with it, but 2 weeks are long, there are no other kids to play with... I don't know...

        Looks like it is titled like that so that it gets caught by child porno algorithms running on Microsoft etc, allowing them to find who is downloading the file dumps. That's the theory

      "Purple cable/chord", that's what it translates to.

    Hi there, throwaway for obvious resons, but been a redditor for some years. I'm portuguese and I can help with translations if needed. I'm on work right now (it's 10am here), so  I will take some time to do it...but I'm willing to help.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you need help with any documents let me know, when I get home I'll see what I can do.

      So this could very easily have nothing to do with DNC, Hillary, Podesta, or pizza gate?

         both seem relevant. Not posting as anyone trying to get attn. Plus I haven't followed up looking into if it was determined to be relevant. So enjoy.. most ppl haven't seen this and I'm deleting it in a few hours.

          I don't know what to make of this. Looks very complicated. I don't know if it is real (and what it means if it is), if it is intentional distraction, and/or whether these cyphers are flexible enough to produce stuff like this.

          There were threads about stenography that turned out to be mostly false, right? Did we find
          <em>
           any
          </em>
          embedded images/codes in anything from Podesta?

           This to my knowledge wasn't from a picture. It was from a website that was linked to someone involved. Vague I know, but I haven't had the chance to look back at that connection.
          </p>
          <p>
           Either way they put it into a code reader, this reader will convert the letters into numbers add them, and then print out any other possible results with the same final number. That's why it's surrounded by all sorts of other strange statements. The chance that the results produced that are virtually impossible for it to be coincidence.
          </p>
          <p>
           Later on the website they found another page simply titled /hellofriends.svg which led to another code that was ciphers into something along the lines of "mention '(forget the word)' to get half off .."
          </p>
          <p>
           I know it's vague but I was trying to keep up last night while falling asleep. Seemed like a legit lead so I'll find the post explaining what I'm trying to say better. While it could be a troll sending us away from what's important I think the results show more circumstantial evidence, however if they stumbled upon what's being used to communicate in this network of sick fucks it could lead to big things.

      While there are reptilian shape shifter-tier people out there, there are also rational people.  There's a lot of weird stuff going on with the pizza place, that's undeniable.  Linking it to actual crimes is what people are discussing.

      Just because its a conspiracy rn doesn't mean it's true nor false.

      All I'm saying is people laughed off the Sandusky allegations at first... along with the UK ring that implicated many politicians and celebrities.

    One of the guys translating, tartaruganinja only just joined reddit hours ago and his only post is on these translations. I would advise caution, just in case. We need other Italian speakers to listen to the audio files and verify what's being said as well.

     Agreed, just one translator can't be trusted, even if they have no bad intentions. We need multiple to assure it is correct.

      It's not uncorrect, it's just that half the meaning is lost by reading a trascript, and another half is lost in translation. It's not a book, the meaning is given also by tone, voice, pauses, choice of words, and trust me, if you read the translation thinking about finding hidden meanings you'll find them, but it's all in your immagination of how this conversation has been carried out.
If you knew italian and listened to the conversation you wouldn't find shit and fall asleep half into it because of how casual it is.

      Because this entire thing is so laughable that it's actually sad. Call me a shill or a normie or whatever but this is the type of conspiracy theory that makes more believable ones look ridiculous by association. You saying that there's some shadowy cabal of trolls keeping you down proves it. What the fuck kind of world are you people living in.

       Not defending this conspiracy was just making an observation. But i did post it when it only had 400 upvotes and the rapid up down fluctuation just seems odd to me.

     This is not from a email it's in the Wikileaks website archive. See the link. Remove everything after /file/and enter it into your browser

      Right, but what leak/dump is it associated with? How do we figure that out? Or does Wikileaks just drop random creepy wav files in their collection of politically important document leaks?

       Not sure but it is associated with 2008 so you would have to search on the main site

      But isn't the archive filled with files that were emailed? Or do people leak these files separately?

      Only an idiot would follow Marina Abramovic's ritual instructions of stabbing your fingers. Have you seen his (John) Pedesta's fingers? The one with the band aid on the middle left fuck you finger is hilarious and creepy at the same time. To me that could only be from doing this to himself because his Serbian goddess (and the other one with the much more unpronounceable name who's shit is even sicker and some are insane enough to think it's art.) Reminds me of Homer's failed real brick BBQ construction being considered art (when the Simpsons were still good, but near the end, season 10 I think). Post-Modern art is nothing. Remember the "everything is shit" whore who did this "display" in college where somehow she had a can of spaghettios filled with shit (she opened the can and it was filled with shit), rubbing it over herself and pissing everywhere...

      Then people say that MMR vaccine is safe. In Canada we used it for 2 months, 3000 children only in 1985 had it then it was banned, the company who pushed it then brought it to Britain, where it also got banned in the 80's, and then it was moved to Australia and over there it wasn't removed until much later. No wonder most aussies I know online are aspies and have the gastric thing coming with it (3 out of 5 aussies seriously), then it was there in 94 to 99 in the US. Basically, if anyone by now hasn't understood that the medicine industry is exactly like what the Illuminati card game calls it (I rather have you guys find it, but it's just common sense). They don't wanna cure you, cure for cancer can't exist, they're trying to find a goddamn vaccine for cancer when it's proven cancer rates went from 1 in 30 000 people to 1 in 4 people (some places 1 in 3). Read Doctor Mary's Monkey. It wasn't planned though, it was a medical error so egregious, people would have come out with the guns.

        When I see something this retarded, I call it out. And defend Podesta for what? Maddie McCann died because her parents fed their children sleeping pills while they went out (toxicology shows that the other children were). They were rich and had political connections so they could dispose of her, the Portugese investigators were shut down by the time they were realising what happened.

    Just so everyone knows, if you take a look over in r/crypto you'll see that Wikileaks might be compromised and have a third party posting and altering things on their behalf.

     We're hunting down a DC pedo ring. Please ignore this post, as all investigations tend to wallow in details until they are discarded. There's definitely something to this, IMHO. Please see the long link in the sidebar? Would be interested in your feedback.

    These are southern Italian accents.  My guess would be no farther north than Rome. (I'm fluent in Italian but not born there)
   </p>
   <p>
    Also, the ring tone at the beginning is something quite old.  Not heard any more for a long time

    Page 56 of mccain pj report Regarding the outcome of the proceedings requested of the British authorities, as mentioned above, although they were fulfilled almost completely nothing new was brought to the file and, consequently, to the investigation. The inquiries to the holiday group were limited to corroborating the investigation already established, without bringing any details that were considered to be especially relevant. In conclusion, it is clear from all that has been done, notwithstanding the efforts made and if all lines of investigation have been explored, it is not possible to obtain a concrete and objective assessment of what actually occurred that night, as well as the current whereabouts of the Minor disappeared. On the other hand, it should be noted that this investigation was carried out in conditions of exceptional media scrutiny, with the publication of immense news "of inaccurate or inaccurate content, which did not help at all the discovery of the truth and created, In this way, it does not seem to us, for the time being, to carry out any other procedural step capable of producing a useful result for the present proceedings, I hereby submit them to the Council for consideration.

       They set up donation pages, sold books about their "tragedy", it's 2016 and at least twice a year we have a new Madeleine McCann headline regarding closing/reopening the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Link to the book if you were interested: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Madeleine-daughters-disappearance-continuing-search/dp/0552165158
      </p>
      <p>
       Over here in the UK it was probably reported a lot more frequently than in the US and the popular line of thought amongst most people is that the parents were accountable or involved to some extent with her going missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't help that the parents have been actively trying to sue the head of the investigation in Portugal, Goncalo Amoral, for claiming that they were responsible for her going missing. They have also threatened legal action against anyone who tries to sell his book "The Truth of the Lie" in UK, which was a best seller in Portugal.

        If my kid went missing and somebody blamed me for it I wouldn't sue. I'd probalt execute. The fact they are pissed doesn't make me suspect them. I'd wanna see some evidence first. Not saying you're wrong, just saying that their behavior from just what you're saying seems logical to me.

           Whilst I'm convinced the McCanns were involved, this leaflet has no citations, so it's therefore useless..

         Yeah that's understandable. The main factor that sways it for me is that the Portuguese Police's initial conclusion was that Maddie died in the room and the parents were responsible for framing it as an abduction, possibly to avoid repercussions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Following this once they were announced as suspects (arguidos) in the investigation, they left Portugal and took with them evidence that the Portuguese authorities had tried to seize. All in all both parents and much of the "Tapas Seven" were hugely uncooperative with police, which is the opposite of what you would expect in the eventuality of your child being "abducted".
        </p>
        <p>
         Surely if your child went missing in a foreign country and there were ongoing investigations you would want to stay there and keep updated directly by local police on the matter no?

     Maddys parents might have been involved, there's a hint for that. They've been at Froyd's grandson house in Portugal, he was a caught pedo later on.

      I don't want to shit on anyones work but in my opinion I agree with the Portuguese police's first conclusion that she died in the apartment and the parents covered it up as an "abduction" to avoid any possible prosecution.

        I agree with you but Podesta involvement doesn't rule out the parents.
       </p>
       <p>
        To me it seems open and shut,all the evidence points to Maddy having died in the apartment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then why the cover up from the met and downing street?
       </p>
       <p>
        The only other suspect was Robert Murat and the evidence against him was very flimsy to say the least.
       </p>
       <p>
        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann
       </p>
       <p>
        The evidence for podesta involvement is far from conclusive but I think its more than they had to suspect Murat.
       </p>
       <p>
        Podesta has ties to padeos via comet pizza and Pervy artwork.
       </p>
       <p>
        Podesta deleted all his emails the day after her disappearance.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is an email refferncing Madeline.
       </p>
       <p>
        E fits match podesta perfectly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Podesta has ties to Portugal via Clinton foundation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think we should be looking for ties between the tapas 7(the group Maddy's parents where holidaying with) and podesta.

        The entire lack of cooperation between the police and the parents certainly seems like an admission of guilt from the McCanns.
       </p>
       <p>
        I agree that it does go higher up, the British Police even to this day flip flop between opening and closing the investigations. All the while people are still donating to the parents foundation they have set up, some figures from tabloids in the millions of pounds. Where does all that money go? That's the big question for me.

       What the heck are you talking about!?  I took action, and am continuing to take action and you come here trying to trash me?  If they sold Madeliene let's find her.....not argue about her on a Reddit thread you sell out.  A part of me wonders if you are working for 'them'.

     If anyone needs any encouragement,Id remind people that there is a huge reward for any information regarding the whereabouts of Maddie.

     I doubt it will make any difference to people but if it encourages more people help out then so be it.

       Made me laugh, sounds like something Mr.Burns would say. (not to remove any seriousness to any of this, I've felt sick since I heard the Opperman Report show on Saturday with Kurt Haskell (the guy who saw that the underwear bomber was a false flag, he was right there in the plane, almost got elected to congress with zero support from the Democrats in 2012, Democrats even tried to bribe a retired Republican named Joe Schwartz to run as Democrat in his place, the guy said no, he beat the other shmoe they put against him in the primary and nearly lost to the Republican guy, and he talked a lot about the false flag, how he saw a guy bring in the idiot inside the plane without a passport, heard the conversation and the well dressed guy who brought him in said "we do this all the time" and the flight attendant or whatever the name of the person who verifies everyone is legit in the plane, after 20 minutes on the phone before leaving Amsterdam said alright and got him in. Seeing 3 rows of seats 8 feet in front of him as he played cards with his wife in fire at 22k feet in the air, and some guy for some reason yelling "Terrorist!" when there was nothing going on, until a security+ flight attendant (huge black guy) put out the fire with an extinguisher, that guy quit his job and is now a mess. Kurt after losing said well fuck this country and moved with his wife to Costa Rica, a country with no army and like 500 cops and paradise compared to Detroit where he ran a lawfirm. The other guest was William Ramsey. I encourage anyone to listen to this, those guys did their research well, it's rare that Ed gets terrified by what he's seen and read, it happened, I felt sick for 3 days when I heard the show then read more about it here and on 4chin, I normally don't go there, I prefer our much quieter stoner chan...I should have just been happy with the fact that Trump won, so the army automatically dropped a level of Defcon from 2 to 3. Clinton in her 4 years managed to bring Defcon from IV (it was a V before 911) to Defcon2...which is basically a hair trigger from nuclear war with Russia. I don't like Trump and he's got links to Epstein even more than Clinton (yes), but he's not a practically senile early parkinson's ill woman who might as wanted to cause the world to die if she was to die. (She had a fucking heart and kidney transplant, most likely stolen from the most healthy person they identified in Obamacare databases, which by the way, those things don't exist in a single payer system, at least, they don't have to, it's not this way up in the great white north).

     Yeah, I saw that a long time ago, a picture of Steve Jobs' medical file on EncyclopediaDramatica (may it never die) that he had aids.
    </p>
    <p>
     I mean look at him in 2002 when he was starting to make money again with his colourful eMacs, fat, huge beard. 5 years later he's skinny like Pedesta (I hope he got aids too, quite possible since he's a serial rapist and no I won't even say alleged, fuck it, he's guilty as sin and I got a variation of what Marina told him to do, take handgun, point in the middle of forehead, pull trigger, EAT HELL FOREVER) with golden statues of the way Ed Gein (or was it Dahmer) "installed" his decapitated "friends".

     They have a perfect accuracy record on their releases and it is vetted, the only question right now is a possible compromise since the drama began.

    Anyone have the identity of the people in the Italian phone calls? Do the legal issues mentioned in the calls explain the file title "child sex"?

     It is not done yet. Question is why would Wikileaks name this folder child sex ?

     Should we ignore these things in the future?

     Wikileaks (100% record) posts about child sex should be ignored?

      I'd be a brand new user too if I was asked to translate something that's in french (I'm a Québécois). I know just saying this reduces me to 7.5 million people on the internet but fuck it, this account is clean as fuck except for the drug pharmacology talk ¬_¬ (and the serial socks5 on top of VPN on top of VPS on top of serial of socks5). 7 proxies, what a joke.
     </p>
     <p>
      But if I was to add anything to this investigation of any significance, I would be a newjack with the protection mentioned above...until then, nope. Nothing more than Virtual Machine that deletes itself when I close it, with a Sandboxed browser (Firefox in Firejail), NoScript, the basics...

    Does anyone else find it odd that they aired a story about ELTON JOHN's "art" collection. It's almost like they are trying to say: See everyone. It's completely normal to have photos of the last moment of a persons life. Actually we collect them.

    W2: Mah, no news, i mean, i was hoping they would have hospitalize him, but it didn't happen. I mean, i talked-, i was in london so i couldn't do a lot, so i phoned the social worker to see if there was any news, and she told there was none in the sense that she understood i wanted to get him hospitalized, but she didn't know they tried to give him an appointment for 10 in the morning, but i think they didn't managed to, because he always keeps the phone off, like he turns it on only in the evening at 9 when he wants to call, so it's really hard to contact him. But (the social worker) talked to him this morning- talked to S- talked yesterday morning with Simon also for telling him the fact that it wasn't a good idea for him to see the kids etc. He accepted and ... and .... but from what (the social worker) understood, Simon was at work, i mean, he was going to the workplace, i mean, he was at work aaaanndddd and nothing, so nothing happened there. Yesterday he didn't phone (me?), but this morning he phoned me 5 minutes before you phoned me and he started saying eeeeeeee "So, see, it's you. What are you doing, why are you phoning to this psychiatrist, Dr. Cumar (not sure about the name. minute ~1:37) etc." But he sounded rational, he was in his- well i said "Simon, it's not me, he is the one who is calling me" well, non- then he say "It's because you told him i've been sick for 10 years" i said "Look, i've been worried for a while, i mean I think you are not ok i mean non- non-" he said "And now, the thing that you don't make me see the kids" i said "It's not like i don't make you see the kids, this is what has been decided, at this point social services (and someone else, i can't understand. minute ~2:06)

I can't do on my will or they might take them away from me too" He didn't sound so convinced, though eeeeeeeeeeeeee he said "I know what game you are playing, now like the usual, you will turn everyone against me" so i said "Simon, it's not me, you involved them, the social services. Now that they are involved it doesn't depend on  what i chose or what you chose, anymore. They decide now." and i said "Even this

Those files are all dated 1984, like George Orwell.   I think this is related to the rumors that Wikileaks is compromised.

       Although Julian’s primary DMS (the release of insurance file encryption keys) did not activate, on October the 18th one of Julian’s contingencies did activate, a script was activated that made https://file.wikileaks.org/file publicly visible and set all the file date and time stamps to 01/01/1984 (Orwell reference). This file repository contains many documents that had not been released prior.

     i think its a major deployment to discredit pizzagate possibly using false info planted at wikileaks then someone leads into maddie mccann conversation which can be a deliberate attempt to target the breakthrough in the case and its been bouncing around at that for a while.  It started just as we went international and has been at the top of the page ever since and spread around other reddits. I think there is a whole room full of shills involved in this move somewhere. Maybe im proved wrong. i hope so.  if it is an attack its a very clever one.

    Can't locate this in the thread right now but files on Mccann that were in Portuguese - someone paraphrased the translations. Are there verbatim transcripts yet? Occult connections were mentioned in the paraphrase.

    I listened to the 41 minute one- it's just talking about some translation jobs, and later about an old lady- I mean to me it was just a conversation with a normal tone.

       Didn't some dumbass congressman or even a country somewhere made it illegal to link? Oh yeah, it was my own country, Canada's previous Conservatard government that wanted to make illegal linking to somewhere without permission of the owner of the place linked. Lol Harper.

      Maddie's dead.
     </p>
     <p>
      She died in the apartment between when she was last seen outside the apartment and when the parents announced "they've taken her".
