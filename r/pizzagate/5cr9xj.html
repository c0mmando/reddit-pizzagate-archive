    The Luzzatto kids in the leaked emails
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    The WikiLeaks
    <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39509">
     emails
    </a>
    mentioned the names of three girls: Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto.
   </p>
   <p>
    According to this
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5b1qtf/comet_ping_pong_pizzagate_summary/">
     post
    </a>
    (the Addendum),
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Tydings">
     Alexandra Tydings
    </a>
    is the mother of the three girls.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is a
    <a href="http://evelynneaville.blogspot.com/">
     blog
    </a>
    <a href="http://archive.is/bcZ6v">
     (http://archive.is/bcZ6v)
    </a>
    dedicated to a girl named "Evie." Upon closer inspection, I was inclined to believe "Evie" is "Maeve Luzzatto" as noted in the leaked emails because of the mention of "Tamera" (who I think is her grandma) and "Luzzattettes" in the blog entries. The dates of these articles also corroborate this:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Maeve Chaim, October 29, 2008

     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     "Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7)," October 8, 2015
     <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39509">
      https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39509
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     It looks like Evie was born in late 2008
     <a href="http://evelynneaville.blogspot.com/2009/02/smiles.html">
      http://evelynneaville.blogspot.com/2009/02/smiles.html
     </a>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    <strong>
     But now I don't believe they are the same person since they have different names, though they appear to be born around the same time.
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    So we know that the Luzzatto family are friends of the Podestas and most likely the Clintons as well. What baffles me is the headline of the blog:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Evelyn is growing up, soon she will be the Queen of the entire US of A, right now, for a limited time only, you can spend some time with her online, raw and uncut. Take advantage of this now, as in the future she will have the power of life and death over you.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    First, her name is "Evelyn" not "Maeve." Second, it is kind of creepy to use "raw and uncut" to describe your grandchild's journey through life and why "life and
    <strong>
     death
    </strong>
    ?"
   </p>
   <p>
    Other things that might seem odd include that the Wikipedia entry for Alexandra Tydings does not mention she has a third child, and the blog was abandoned after May 2010.
   </p>
   <p>
    Maybe Evie is a daughter of a family relative? And I need a tinfoil hat. I would like to hear your opinions on this. Thank you.
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit: Add a date.
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit 2: Apparently, "Maeve" and "Evelyn" are two different persons. For other connections, I'm wondering what are the links between "East Hampton Babysitters/Massage" (the website is down now) and the midwifery center where Maeve was born.

    Evelyn is someone different from Maeve. Maeve, Ruby and Emerson are cousins of Evelyn (Evie)

     That makes sense. It is indeed difficult to find more information about this because of its private and sensitive nature. Tydings'
     <a href="http://www.alexandratydings.com/">

     </a>
     might shed some light into what she is doing professionally, but I doubt we can extract something relevant to the case. BTW, the Wikipedia
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Tydings">

     is being vandalized due to recent events.
