    Read them all.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are three options:
   </p>
   <p>
    1- They killed her and disposed of the body somehow. They might even have killed her, hid her behind the sofa and called somebody to come get the body. Could be anyone that came to dispose of the body that was near the place, even the podesta's.
   </p>
   <p>
    2 - They agreed with someone to come get Madeline beforehand,  without her being dead.
   </p>
   <p>
    3 - It was a real child abduction case without any forthknowledge of the parents.

     This is beginning to remind me of the JonBen√©t Ramsey case.
    </p>
    <p>
     Edit: Also, think back to every high-profile child abduction/murder case, think of the millions of dollars in legal expenses...
The more I dig into PizzaGate the more I'm convinced just about everyone of status is suspect.

      The thing about the "high-profile" child abduction cases that always seemed weird to me was...Why were those "selected" to be high profile? There are thousands of child abduction cases every year...why are a select few deemed to be so noteworthy?

       The media is what makes it high profile. Some they ignore but others become a feeding frenzy for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest they could be completely innocent and just scared of the police. The worst thing you can do is start giving answers to police in an abduction or murder case, even if you are innocent.

        In general, yes. I got pulled over when I was 18 5 minutes after I drank 2 beers and I had more beer in the back seat, and weed/ paraphernalia...The cop had a drug dog.
        <strong>
         Of course
        </strong>
        when he asked me if I had been drinking or had drugs I just said, "Nope". Nothing happened.
       </p>
       <p>
        But when the choice is between
        <em>
         maybe
        </em>
        seeming guilty, and finding your 4 year old daughter...I think you answer the questions.
       </p>
       <p>
        EDIT: I said "quilty" instead of "guilty"

      the jonbenet case was one of the first things i thought about when pizzagate started. I heard some theory that i thought was crazy related to the case a long time ago.  Basically it said that her father was involved in some way with a pedophile ring in colorado where people in robes raped children. There were implications of it being "illuminati" related and that's when i completely dismissed it back when I heard it. now it sounds eerily similar to this pizza mess.
     </p>
     <hr/>
     <p>
      weird things about the case for the unfamiliar
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        jonbenet is thought to have suffered sexual abuse prior to her murder based on autopsy findings
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        blood from an unknown male found in her underwear
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        many people suspected the family members either murdered her and/or tried to cover up her death with a fake story. the ransom note was weird to say the least. oh and she was found dead in their own basement
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        the boulder police are criticized for how terribly they managed the case and allowing the crime scene to be compromised
       </p>
      </li>
     </ul>

       I was a mailman in the richest part of CO for several years, at the time it was the richest in the nation: I've heard things as well. CO police are surprisingly one of the most dirty forces in this country (money talks), and I'm from ChiCongo!

     If this were the case, I don't understand the harm in answering any of those questions, especially in the context of trying to find your 4 year old daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     I get that having to answer personal questions that will be open to public/media scrutiny is something I wouldn't
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     to do, but would gladly do if it would help find my daughter.

    I had not read that a sniffer dog had found "corpse scent" in the apt. There is a picture of an older child w Podesta some have wondered might be an older Maddie. She is most likely dead.
   </p>
   <p>
    The unanswered questions are heartbreaking. She knew. She knew she would not be found in the searches (just sat on the child's bed). Appeared conflicted-- overwhelmed with Maddie and younger twins, medicated them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Odd:  Maddie's DNA and corpse scent found in trunk of car rented 1 month
    <em>
     after her "abduction".
    </em>
    Hmmm, that walk in freezer at pizza place.  Soooo disturbing.

     So the car.  Could they not run records of who had rented that car in the month prior?  Sure, it would be dozens of people, but even with aliases,  a match would come about somewhere.  People who use aliases often use them many times.

    "34. As for your professional life, in how many and which hospitals have you worked?
35. What is your medical specialty?
36. Have you ever done shift work in any emergency services or other services?
37. Did you work every day?
38. At a certain point you stopped working, why?
   </p>
   <p>
    These might be good questions for us to try and research. Maybe there were similar disappearances at the places she worked.

      Surely the police looked at video footage from the restaurant? I wonder if the files from the investigation were released or if they can't be released since it isn't closed yet
