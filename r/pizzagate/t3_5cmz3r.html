<p><p>The ad is creepy yes, but don't sensationalize. </p>
<p>The Pentagram is not "Satanic". The Pentagram has been used Wiccans (a fairly innocent religions), and had been a major Christian symbol since the Medieval Times, symbolizing the fives senses and and the five wounds of Christ. Yes, it has been used by the Occult as well, but so has many symbols. </p></p>

<p><p>There is a connection actually. The user Pizza and Furries also was reposting stuff from Pizza Brain and Comet Pizza on tumblr. Pizza and Furries reposted this as well.</p>
<p>From what I've seen on Tumblr, this "sex pizza" culture is very active. People are part of a community on there, and somehow know who to follow/who is posting pics of sexual pizza and also kids eating pizza. This is a lead.</p>
<p>^ I do agree the Pentagram isn't satanic though. But who is the artist? Maybe we can see if they have other questionable art.</p></p>

<p><p>Good idea on looking up more work by that artist! </p>
<p>I'm not really active on Tumblr, but if you've seen this sub-culture on there it may be a good idea to take screen caps so we have a bit more solid proof. Especially since they may be deleting/changing their urls/going private pretty soon. </p></p>

<p><p>When next to Dead things displayed with it, that is most certainly Satanic.</p></p>

<p><p>Wicca was started with influence from Aleister Crowley and in its early days had connections with Idries Shah, another occultist.  Crowley practised animal sacrifice, drinking blood from freshly killed animals, and some say human sacrifice. He wrote about sacrificing children, which is what we are trying to stop. </p>
<p>Edit: This does not mean all Wiccans of today do these things as well.</p></p>

<p><p>Whatever the influences of Wicca are, I am suggesting we do not paint in broad strokes, and show that we actually know what we're talking about. Claiming that the pentagram is Satanic kind of instantly discredits us- because it makes us seem like we can't even do basic research before making claims. Use logic, and hard evidence! </p>
<p>A Pedophile Rings that dabbles in Occult stuff does not = All pentagrams are Satanic. </p></p>

<p><p>So they would probably celebrate on the winter solstice also. Might be something to try to get ahead of.</p></p>
