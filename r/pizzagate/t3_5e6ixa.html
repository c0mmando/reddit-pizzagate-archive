<strong>How To Tell People About Pizza Gate?</strong>
<p><p>I'm trying to spread the word about pizza gate but I have a few questions.
What is the safest way to do so?
What should I say as an introductory to everything?
Should I make sure they know not to post in here without protecting themselves?</p></p>

<p><p>I don't know. But I am sick of ignorant motherfuckers who refuse something like this could happen and then condemn you for thinking it could while never looking at the evidence. Fuck your safe space.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm trying to explain to my closest friends as well. Well I want to, but I don't want to give out an uneducated explanation. I want to be as concise, yet as simple as I can get. Can any one help? </p></p>

<p><p>Show them these threads. Explain what is happening.</p>
<p>Let them know that if you click on the actual Twitter accounts, you both would see child porn.</p>
<p>The most effective route, I've found, is to present people with avenues in which they can discover it for themselves.</p></p>

<p><p>Yep yep and yep. There's a sound basis for the assertion that when folks are presented with info that goes against their current beliefs, they will only dig their heels in further. I feel the best way to introduce something to someone, is to make them FEEL like they discovered it on their own. They will be much more comfortable with the influx of new information. </p></p>

<p><p>I was thinking about printing stickers that say #pizzagate with maybe a short phrase to get people looking it up. I was going to sticker every public surface on my way to and from work. </p>
<p>But. with the censorship, is a hashtag even going to work?</p></p>

<p><p>Right cause pizzagate will definitly get peoples attention... if they are hungry. If i saw a pizzagate sticker with a hashtag in front i would think its some Stupid fuckin sticker advertisement for some shitty pizza place.</p></p>

<p><p>Maybe a "Hide yo wife, hide yo kids" reference is suitable. Oh well, in this case, "Hide yo ~~wife~~kids, hide yo kids" </p></p>

<p><p>I made a complete summary of the entire situation for people to riff through. The only thing not covered is the Heavy Breathing stuff, which you should show separately in video format.</p>

<p>Share this around! (It's intentionally not in meme format so you can follow all of the details.)</p></p>

<p><p>Make a fews joke about cheese pizza. If they ask wtf you are talking about, then say haven't you heard about pizza gate?  They'll say, no (laughs) wtf is that?  Then tell them to google pizzagate. They'll then say, is that safe? Yep, just read the headlines. No need to click on anything. </p></p>

<p><p>I usually start like this:</p>
<p>When people go to buy drugs, the drug dealer makes them snort a rail to prove they aren't a narc. This could be urban legend or whatever. But the principle matters: the dealer needs some proof that the buyer is complicit in their crime and that the buyer is not some undercover do gooder. </p>
<p>Now relate that concept to any other illicit activity. </p></p>
