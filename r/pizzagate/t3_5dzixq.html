        <p><p>Considering the circumstances, and the fact that this guy was acting kind of douchey and makes a terrible sleuth, it's really not all that suspicious that they threw him out.</p>
<p>Edit: also, as was pointed out, this is old news</p></p>

        <p><p>These videos don't really make a case for me. Just seems like they were being bothersome. I think there are more important things to focus on as evidence if this whole thing is legitimate.</p></p>

        <p><p>This guy is a Alex Jones wannabe just trying to get himself noticed so he can get a job with infowars. What's the point of doing this other than to call attention to himself? As if this excursion was going to uncover some actual evidence weeks after the story broke? Well, it didn't. No surprise. </p></p>
