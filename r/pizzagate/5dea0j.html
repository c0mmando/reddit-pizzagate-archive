   <strong>
    Over the past few weeks I helped bring up the Laura Silsby/Alefantis connection - now I think I've tied them all to one single organization
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    There seems to be an organization central to all the finds that we have been uncovering over the past few weeks. One which links Laura Silsby, James Alefantis, David Brock, other individuals that I loosely refer to as the “DC Group” as well as others.
   </p>
   <p>
    See my past threads for more info on Silsby, as well as Alefantis and his Comet Ping Pong pizza establishment:

   <h1>
    I. The NCMEC
   </h1>
   <p>
    <strong>
     What is the NCMEC?
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    This organization is the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). See their web page here:
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.missingkids.com/
   </p>
   <p>
    The NCMEC  website says “In January 1984 NCMEC was incorporated by private individuals as a non profit corporation to serve as a national resource center and clearinghouse on issues related to missing and sexually exploited children.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The term “private corporation” is key here. They do not have government oversight. This means they act as gate-keeper for the government to deal with child porn material without any oversight over what they’re doing, and law enforcement cannot get involved without them giving a go ahead.
   </p>
   <p>
    NCMEC haven’t exactly been responsible in this oversight free role they are given either. They are in the middle of a law suit over their handling of child pornography constituting a violation of the Fourth Amendment:
   </p>
   <p>
    https://cybercrimereview.blogspot.de/2013/11/district-court-ncmec-violated-4th.html
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/TROdU
   </p>
   <p>
    The details of the suit are as follows: AOL maintains a database of hash values assigned to images classified as child abuse so that they are more easily identified/tracked. AOL was simply sending NCMEC the images without bothering to open them and verify the contents. So NCMEC was violating the right to protection from undue searches and seizures by opening what AOL sent. Notice how in this instance, only NCMEC was aware of what the photo actually was (and think about how that could be used to keep a lid on information).
   </p>
   <p>
    The NCMEC is significant mainly because of the oddly large number of connections it has. They appear to have some strong ties to Hollywood: Brian Cranston has been involved with them in the past and helped to make educational resources for them:
   </p>

   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/MiWnk
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     II. NCMEC Connections to Silsby and the “DC Group”
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Especially interesting is that the NCMEC has connections to both stories I have previously run concerning child sex trafficking.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     A. Laura Silsby
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Since being arrested in Haiti for trying to steal 33 children and getting let off the hook with the help of the Clinton’s, Silsby has moved on to inappropriately continue to work in the anti-human trafficking sector.  Silsby moved to Idaho and adoped the last name
    <strong>
     Gayler
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Silsby has moved on to work for a company called AlertSense which works with a number of US states on their alert systems, which include Amber Alerts.
   </p>
   <p>
    https://www.alertsense.com/industries/#government
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/4eWSi
   </p>
   <p>
    Here is a local info webpage showing her working for AlertSense, as well as AlertSense’s main webpage showing that Silsby works on their Executive Team. Why would they let a woman convicted of trafficking children anywhere near systems that dealt with Amber Alerts?
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Laura-Silsby/-1978794537
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/wka7C
   </p>
   <p>
    https://www.alertsense.com/company/executive-team/
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/xFplZ
   </p>
   <p>
    And here is a less academic source covering Silsby’s move from a Haitian prison to AlertSense:
   </p>
   <p>
    http://rebrn.com/re/convicted-child-trafficker-works-for-company-responsible-for-amb-2942303/
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/kzAQS
   </p>
   <p>
    So how does this relate to the NCMEC? They are in charge of the Amber Alert program:
   </p>
   <p>

   <h1>
    III. NCMEC Connection to Alefantis/Brock
   </h1>
   <p>
    <strong>
     A. James Alefantis/David Brock/the “DC Group” Connections to Jeff Koons
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Remember how James Alefantis posted an “art” piece by Jeff Koons showing him having sex with what is purportedly his pornstar wife?
   </p>
   <p>
    https://i.sli.mg/IFs0bU.png
   </p>
   <p>
    It turns out that Jeff Koons is more to Alefantis than an artist he admires. To begin with, Koons is very involved with the DC/East Coast art scene.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here on page 10 both Alefantis and Koons are mentioned as being involved in the DC art scene for example:
   </p>
   <p>
    http://digital.modernluxury.com/publication/?i=9965&amp;p=12
   </p>
   <p>
    But none of these circumstantial bits of evidence are as important as the discovery that
    <strong>
     Correct the Record paid Jeff Koons $50,000
    </strong>
    according to their SEC filing, seen here on page 9:
   </p>
   <p>
    http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/318/201607159020655318/201607159020655318.pdf#navpanes=0
   </p>
   <p>
    Correct the Record is run by David Brock, who is in a relationship with James Alefantis. Here is a link confirming this and showing them caught up with another individual in some kind of blackmail love triangle:
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/02/27/media-matters-boss-paid-former-partner-850g-blackmail-settlement.html
   </p>
   <p>
    Here is a photo of Brock on Alefantis' Instagram:
   </p>
   <p>
    https://i.sli.mg/p58Eks.png
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     B. Jeff Koons Work Connections to the NCMEC
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    How is the connection to Koons Important? Koons is a board member of the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC). You can find an admission of that fact on his own web page:
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.jeffkoons.com/biography-summary
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/hfUS0
   </p>
   <p>
    The ICMEC was founded in 1998 by none other than the NCMEC:

   <h1>
    IV. NCMEC Connections to Thorn and Hollywood
   </h1>
   <p>
    <strong>
     A. What is Thorn?
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    The NCMEC investigation arose while I was looking in to an organization called Thorn. Thorn: Digital Defenders of Children (previously known as DNA) was founded by Hollywood personalities Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore.  Wikipedia mentions that several other Hollywood stars support Thorn, and Brian Cranston (who also has worked with the NCMEC) has sponsored an event for them recently:
   </p>
   <p>
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_(organization)
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/YKCJV
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.wearethorn.org/
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/RL6Il
   </p>
   <p>
    One of the main services Thorn provides is creation of product (termed “SpotLight” and “Solis” for use on the clear and dark net respectively) that help with API, software which sifts through the material.
   </p>
   <p>
    It does this sifting by scanning the hash symbols which were previously mentioned in this post (relevant to the case which landed the NCMEC in hot water for violating the Fourth Amendment). Thorn was involved with the creation of this hash symbol identification system.
   </p>
   <p>
    https://www.wearethorn.org/spotlight/
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/NYOZP
   </p>
   <p>
    Despite Thorns claim’s about the effectiveness of their software, they have only identified 6,325 victims and 2,186 traffickers. These numbers are quite a paltry drop in the pond when you consider the fact that over 800,000 children are reported missing each year:
   </p>
   <p>
    http://abcnews.go.com/US/missing-children-america-unsolved-cases/story?id=19126967
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/RVFTn
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     B. Thorn's Connection to the NCMEC
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Thorn doesn’t just sell products to “help” combat child trafficking though, they also facilitate a meeting of various companies’ tech advisors in what is known as the Thorn Tech Task Force. Members of the Task Force include Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, Dropbox, Yahoo, Instagram, Tumblr, Imgur and Pinterest (many of whom were caught favoring the Clintons in the recent election).  Officially, Thorn merely provides this guideline for the Task Force and doesn’t take an official role.
   </p>
   <p>
    https://www.wearethorn.org/sound-practices-guide-stopping-child-abuse/
   </p>
   <p>
    http://archive.is/eVL08
   </p>
   <p>
    Once the various representatives in the task force go back to work, they collaborate closely with the NCMEC. And they are working with the very hash system that got the NCMEC in hot water for Fourth Amendment violations.
   </p>
   <p>
    Again, when their hash sharing system catches an image, it is shared only between the companies and the NCMEC. And the recent lawsuit the NCMEC is embroiled in indicates that the companies don’t even look at flagged images themselves. Think about how this could absolve them of liability while also ensuring that no one other than the NCMEC was able to view or access the flagged images.
   </p>
   <p>
    The NCMEC, ICMEC and Thorn all need to be placed under more intense scrutiny and investigation given Thorn’s work with the NCMEC and the NCMEC’s association with AlertSense (where Silsby works) and Koons, who has associations with David Brock and his partner James Alefantis.
   </p>
   <p>
    A huge thank you to /u/GiUnit for sending me this scoop. He did most of the legwork on this one and all I really had to do was connect the dots.

      I posted in the I FOUND a SMOKING GUN thread some ideas on getting SOMEONE to ACKNOWLEDGE all this as well..BUT HERE..I found some might be EXTREMELY helpful info..I started with this
http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42108748/ns
     </p>
     <p>
      which led me to a REPORT on the Europol site..CAN'T FIND the report again..BUT I FOUND a link on the web site to SUBMIT INFO for THEM to TAKE ACTION on...there's ALSO other reports of OTHER BIG rings THEY'VE busted with the coordination of like 28 COUNTRIES...
HERE is the CORRECT LINK TO REPORT to...nope I can't FIND it again..BUT it says to report to your LOCAL POLICE..
BUT I am gonna leave a link here to the report a crime page...THERE IS A PHONE NUMBER....I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH OF THIS STUFF Y'ALL FOUND TO CALL MYSELF N ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK I HAVE INTERNATIONAL CALLING...I WOULD SUGGEST SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THIS WHOLE STORY(THIS FAR) CONTACT THEM N EXPLAIN THAT OUR POLICE AREN'T DOING ANYTHING N TELL THEM WHY WE THINK THEY AREN'T...THEY MUST HAVE SOME KINDA ADVICE?! JUST A POSSIBLE SUGGESTION LOL

    Even if this all of this somehow turns out to be completely on the up and up, my view of the universe will be forever changed. This is a rabbit hole drop off

     One thing that I believe to be 100% true is that there are pedophilia and child sex rings throughout different levels of government.
    </p>
    <p>
     There have even been national TV programs on the topic, https://youtu.be/JfNeB6Hx7N0 - BBC 60 Minutes
    </p>
    <p>
     It's happened in the Catholic church and high levels of UK government, and it's happening here in the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether these particular pizza gate revelations lead to something or don't, it is still very clear that something needs to be done about these groups.

      I won't dispute they haven't existed forever, but I hope we've reached a critical mass of information transfer and we take them out before this is all censored

      One of the elite thought they had seen so much child porn that it was almost normal now. At his level I'm sure it was true.
     </p>
     <p>
      The pope resigned a few weeks after saying that.

    Great work.
   </p>
   <p>
    Well researched, organized and explained.
   </p>
   <p>
    We're onto the biggest secret of all time. Imagine what the in-fighting must be like between: DNC, FBI, CIA, NSA.
   </p>
   <p>
    The DNC, and it's partners (Correct the Record) are corrupt in their work, and able to keep people clear of the real pedophiles. The CIA knows that the info is too big to share with the public, so it's running a counter op. The FBI knows what's going on, but they are trying to build an irrefutable case, and they know everything is going to come crashing down, so they are being careful. The NSA just straight up knows everything, and is probably complicit at the largest scale.

     I like to think the NSA has some friendly eyes on the inside. I remember reading somewhere that they were founded as a counterbalance to the CIA's excesses.

      I am confident that the good guys in every branch of the government are working together to get rid of the baddies... except for the ones with shitty looking .gov websites. If their website looks like angelfire and they have a "Donate" button... then they are riddled with corruption... and prolly not invited to the justice party.

      I remember reading that a bunch of them spied on girl friends, had child porn in their computers, etc. I never saw that any of them ever got fired for it.

    Yeah... I hit upon the NCMEC a couple weeks back as being bad guys... it didn't come from anything pizza related though. So it is good to see someone else convene on the same spot that I did from a different direction.
   </p>
   <p>
    You could also check into the validity of Amber Alerts... have any opinion on their real use... I see we are both suspicious, but I'm not sure how they were used... just another money sink for greed... or an early warning alarm for pedos in the wild... disinfo program to point people in the wrong direction during an abduction?

     Not sure, I just started looking at Amber Alerts as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wonder if there's anything to the idea that someone could delay/halt Amber Alerts being sent out without anyone knowing.

      Oh... I think the entire Amber Alert system was cooked up for nefarious reasons... The stats for it's success rates are fucking terrible... and they hardly ever use it. At best I think it was a way to siphon/launder money... at worst a way to warn pedos/misinform the public.
     </p>
     <p>
      edit - and if we're being total pessimistic assholes... I'm gonna call out Coats for Kids. Hell... let's throw INOBTR on the funeral pyre as well...

      But give a I'll give a shoutout to DOJ - CEOS &amp; PSC... All my homework says they are legit.

      My community had a 10 year old girl go missing on Nov. 2nd.  There was no AMBER alert sent out to area cell phones because NCMEC guidelines require a car description to send out the Amber Alert.  http://www.tylerpaper.com/TP-News+Local/255558/why-cell-phones-werent-activated-in-amber-alert-for-missing-east-texas-girl
     </p>
     <p>
      She was found dead on Nov. 5th stuffed in a well.  He uncle killed her.  I know this has nothing to do with Pizzagate,  but i feel since we are looking at NCMEC and Amber Alerts  this should be mentioned.  WTF?  Why wouldn't you send out an alert in a community when there is potentially an abduction.   As a parent I would have been more alerted to girls fitting her description and there was a possibility that someone might have seen her saving her life.

    This has to be worth looking into. Elizabeth Bagley from 1994 to 1997, served as the U.S. Ambassador to Portugal(possible Madeline McCann connection). She was one of the biggest donors to the Clinton Campaign during the election. Bagley is a member of the Board of Directors of the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (ICMEC).

    While I want to believe this (or not? I don't want to think children are being trafficked, and hope it isn't true,) I could never share something like this on FB without complete undeniable proof. If not then I'll be labeled as one hell of a right wing conspiracist and never hold any credibility. Then again, those liberal thinking people don't believe anything is wrong with their party.

     Being liberal doesn't exclude you from believing very convincing albeit additive clues. An overhaul in the DNC would be very closely related to a extradition of these pedos. And non-establishment liberals will want both in the end.

      It isn't that they are Liberal, it's the fact the Liberal people on my FB are the more stubborn ones that refuse to fault the Democratic party. I had to fight one on the fact that third party voters are not at fault for Hillary losing. She didn't care, Hillary's loss was apparently Johnson and Steins voters fault. There are other things that they argue that don't make sense. The Republicans on my FB are more moderate and anti-establishment and will have more room for understanding.

       Okay yeah I get that. Older Democrats and ones who inherited it are very much in denial about that. Thats frustrating. Anyways, I know that this sub has a lot of Trump followers in it, but this shit is disgusting to any decent human being. This isn't a red vs blue issue, and it will get derailed if it's treated as such.

    Do you have anything showing Silby's name change to Gayler?
   </p>
   <p>
    Also have you found anything else on the Andrew Kline and Arun Rao leads? It would be huge if you could connect them to the NCMEC.

     I don't right now but there are multiple sources that talk about the name change. If you look at the sources I cited, one uses Silsby as the last name and the other Gayler. Both in relation to the same individual working for the same company.
    </p>
    <p>
     I haven't but I literally just started looking at NCMEC this week.

      I found this website that seems to have a lot of information about Laura Silsby.

     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      Apparently she had two lawyers withdraw from her child custody case in Idaho?
     </p>
     <p>
      It also talks about her marriage. Just trying to help bro.

      So it's odd that the two articles about Laura's attorneys quitting is nowhere to be found. I only found this from the Idaho statesman.
     </p>
     <p>
      http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/article40706748.html
     </p>
     <p>
      It is rather unhelpful.
     </p>
     <p>
      The articles about her attorneys quitting are GONE. The author is one Katy Moeller.
     </p>
     <p>
      Perhaps someone should try to contact her about this...
     </p>
     <p>
      Her Twitter is @KatyMoeller  but I am not a cuck and therefore do not have a twatter act. Someone pls halp?

    After Laury Silsby's group was arrested, the legal advisor that came forward was
    <strong>
     actually
    </strong>
    under investigation for sex trafficking:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     In the days following the group's initial arrest, Dominican Jorge Puello took on the role of legal advisor. Puello later acknowledged that he is under investigation for sex trafficking in El Salvador and wanted in the United States for smuggling people across the Canada–US border. Puello was incarcerated for short terms in both Canada and the US. He was arrested in the Dominican Republic on March 18. On August 18, 2010, the Dominican Supreme Court authorized Puello's extradition to the United States where he was sentenced to 37 months of prison in June 2011.

     Sounds like a figure that we should all know about right? Wonder if that sort of data has been supressed purposefully.

       According to ABC it came from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. I doubt it's a blown up number, if anything its downplayed.

     I haven't seen it mentioned but I remember hearing there were nearly 9000 missing refugee children (from syria) in Europe. I don't know if they are found yet (couldn't find anything) I wonder if this has anything to do with.

      Everything is cause for alarm right now. I'm literally thinking about this everyday... feeling stressed about it because there's a high chance all this work will amount to nothing because the lines are connected to the very top including people in law enforcement.

      Remember there were occasions where the secret service were not asked to follow Clinton to Epstein's island. That also means that there were other occasions where they
      <em>
       were
      </em>
      allowed in. If they partook in any of the activities being alleged, they are not going to say a word.

       Same here. I found all about this yesterday and didn't even sleep but kept refreshing pages to see if there was any progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not that familiar with what Clintons have been doing as I'm not from the USA (I'm from Turkey) but I read all about those occasions. Only a few names are mentioned but this is bigger than that and I'm afraid what's going on here, what's being done here won't be enough. Like you said they won't say a word.

        However for there to be any real impact and prosecution like there was in the UK recently, the security services need to be active in the investigation. But happens if the FBI and CIA themselves are entangled in the web?

         We KNOW they have been covering it up for decades because they have not been prosecuting it as a crime and it is not believable that they didn't know about it. So we know the CIA and the FBI are already compromised. That should be taken as a given.
        </p>
        <p>
         What to do about it? Complain about it publicly. Ask congress people directly (phone or visit their offices) and ask them what they are doing about it. Phone local newspapers and ask them why they are not covering it as a story. Public pressure will blow the whole thing open.

      You're doing fine, but need to stay away from defining your findings with bad info. Because if everything else is correct except for one thing, skeptics should and will point to it as misinformation.
     </p>
     <p>
      We just want to stay out of the conspiracy rut of creating a bias towards absurdity and logical leaps.

    I wouldnt be surprised if the NCMEC has connections to all the charities that popped up in the investigation:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     nph-mexico (Kate Damon who has connections to Alefantis)
    </li>
    <li>
     Hope of New Guinea (Wife of Besta Pizzas Manager Ibrahima Abe Diallo's is working there)
    </li>
    <li>
     New Life Childrens Refugee (Laura Silsby/Gayler)
    </li>
    <li>
     Beyond Borders (Haiti Charity across the streets of Comet &amp; Besta)
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Lets check these 4 and potential conenctions!

    I'm wondering whether some folks on the task force patrolling the deep web are in fact protecting the pedophiles and child traffickers they claim to be digging up and/or tipping them off to search methods being used to find them and/or are actually pedophiles and traffickers themselves.
   </p>
   <p>
    It seems to be a pattern for people to hide in vaunted roles as protectors of those they victimize.

    This is the kind of post that a lot of people need to take note of: find something out and research it yourself to determine if it goes anywhere BEFORE clogging the place up with nonsensical posts that don't have any credibility at all. Take the lead from Yiff, people, for the sanity of us all...please.

    So Laura Silsby is married to Norman Gayler. Do we have any info on him that may give us leads? If not, anyone know where we should start? Being married to homegirl, I think is enough to at least put him on the radar.
   </p>
   <p>
    Also, on another note - I've been creeping on this subreddit for about 3 weeks now with no real diligence to anonymity. I was using my main reddit account username, although never posted any comments or up/downvoted any posts. Well now I have created a new throwaway reddit account and got Tor browser (this is actually my first comment on this subreddit. yay.). I want to help investigate and add eyes to these sick truths. But what about being involved on this subreddit when on an iphone? I have location services turned off. Should I stay off this subreddit when I'm not able to be on Tor browser on desktop? Thanks, soldiers.

    Don't know where this applies, but in Sid Blumenthal's contact list that was leaked, cometpingpong@gmail.com was auto-added to his contacts - like all email software does to frequently-emailed addresses that aren't found in contacts.

      Sure thing. I forget how I got to it, but
      <a href="https://cryptome.org/2016/08/guccifer-sid-blumenthal-4908-contacts.xls">
       this is the link
      </a>
      I got it from. Heads up, it's a direct link so it'll automaticall start downloading the Excel document. The document itself looks like the output of an exported contacts file.
     </p>
     <p>
      There's a link going around the Pizzagate subs today of some weird website with crazy links, and in the background is a bunch of text. It's the exact same contacts list as that spreadsheet (if you Ctrl+A and paste into a Word doc or something, since the images obscure some of the text)
     </p>
     <p>
      The guy in the comment linked below actually called one of the names on the list today. Note that is not actor Bill Murray, but ex-CIA exec William Murray.

      <strong>
       Edited to say: I was just commenting on the fact that cometpingpong@gmail was in Sid Blumenthal's address book, not a comment on that weird link.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dg0dj/this_needs_attention_right_now_absolutely_bizare/">
        This is the thread where the weird website discussion originated
       </a>
       . There are some in that thread - me included - that think it's just a troll site. If it were real a real pedo/traffiking website there'd be no reason to put the contacts of one of their inner circle members as the background of the landing page.

    I haven't read all the comments yet but there is something about this Amber Alert ringing bells in the back of my mind.  I know people have said that the Podesta brothers are somehow involved in the so called "abduction" of Madeleine McCann in Portugal and how they fit the sketches.   Now when I was right into reading all the blogs and FB groups about the parents of Madeleine, Gerry and Kate McCann there was a lot of mention of a man who had been a top cop in Northern Ireland and how he had started up some kind of similar operation in the UK like this NCMEC and for some reason this Amber Alert seems so similar, Jim Gamble is his name there are many blogs all over the internet about him and this operation here .  As we know child trafficking/paedophilia is a world wide abomination not just down to a few countries.  Might be worth a look into it for our impressive detectives on here and see if you can join the dots even further.

    Im confused. You're implying all these people are part of an international pedo ring, one formed by some well known anti-pedo companies and people

     I think what I'm implying is that regardless of whether it's one single ring or not, people who engage in pedophilia seem to have gained positions that allow them to manipulate anti trafficking groups to their benefit.

       Good way to think, but I can give you a personal anecdote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had woman enter my family's life. She married my uncle, and worked a nursing home. Ended up draining people's accounts, getting caught, and going through legal hell with her multiple times, and my uncle ends up disappearing. We never even got to see his body.
      </p>
      <p>
       You always think "NO WAY" that could happen. But it can. And it does. All the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were a pedo, wouldn't you seek a job, that would  best tip you off if you were on their radar?

          Yes, be careful. On a related note, there was an episode on Criminal Minds if I'm not wrong, where the sexual predator actually founded an organization working on the same issue to avoid being thought as a likely suspect themselves.

           It is what they do. It is a no-brainer.
          </p>
          <p>
           Also, demanding simple explanations for everything is a way of retarding higher order thinking and investigation; it is an attempt at brainwashing. I would assume this poster is a part of their criminal cover up.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hopefully someone will identify who it is, but I know, being anon here is a big deal. I'm not going there, I'm just suggesting that real law enforcement types probably already have if they are doing their job properly. That is a big if in this case.

          Actually I'm not an agent. Obviously nothing I can say will prove that to you.
         </p>
         <p>
          I'm not discrediting you to be honest, your own argument discredits itself by being so stupid.
         </p>
         <p>
          I mean seriously, in a world where "the best place for a pedo to hide is an anti-pedo company", how the fuck do you think companies wouldn't be not only expecting it but ready for it? let alone that one of the companies mentioned is one of the forerunners of ACTUAL anti-pedo stuff (Ashton Kutcher's one).
         </p>
         <p>
          Calling me a shill or "agent" for pointing out the obvious plotholes in your shitposting (which quite frankly has all the hallmarks of a *chan concentrated trolling effort), and you're only making yourself look even more like someone deliberately manipulating the narrative, and you make any moderate person (such as myself) think you're a retard, which is exactly what the /pol/ types who came up with this entire ruse want, you to make yourself look stupid.
         </p>
         <p>
          Congrats for falling for it man, in your haste to escape these non-existant agents, you made yourself into one for someone else.
         </p>
         <p>
          edit: PS if your first response to my actual logical argument was not to even attempt to disprove it but straight away ignore it and then make me look bad, that's known as an "ad hominem attack" - one of the #1, go-to standard-use-plays of the *chan troll, so you're only making me look like i'm talking sense even more buddy.
         </p>
         <p>
          But please, go ahead and keep your tinfoil hat on until it's just you talking to the shills in here.

           You are saying the opposite of what every single expert says. You are here to spread disinformation.

           Look: http://crime.about.com/od/sex/p/pedophile.htm

          <p>
           The major identifying characteristic for a pedophile, is that they work around children.
          </p>
          <p>
           "Pedophiles Work Around Children:
          </p>
          <p>
           The pedophile will often be employed in a position that involves daily contact with children. If not employed, he will put himself in a position to do volunteer work with children, often in a supervisory capacity such as sports coaching, contact sport instruction, unsupervised tutoring or a position where he has the opportunity to spend unsupervised time with a child."
          </p>
          <p>
           You are a shill, get out of here, everything you have said has been false.

     Think of Pollos Hermanos in Breaking bad.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some workers are in on it. Key, higher up workers, plus some pleb workers are in on it. Many workers honestly don't have a clue and are just flipping burgers. Or maybe they do have suspicions, but they want to keep their job. And they really do the actual work they are meant to do. They just occasionally siphon off selected merchandise.

      Yes but, surely if youre a pedo the last place you would hide out is somewhere that not only actively hunting pedos but can point to a multi-decade record of doing so successfully? You'd be caught in 5 minutes because surely the company would be expecting pedos who think theyre smart to go "aha ill hide in plain sight they'll never suspect it..."

        I don't think bank robbing and international child trafficking and exploitation are particularly comparable yknow
       </p>

        plus if you're a big enough bank the government just saves you anyway.... wait... fuck.

     This has been a thorn in the side of true missing children advocates, all along. Thing about it: There is
     <strong>
      no
     </strong>
     government database of missing children. It's all privatized.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just like the privatization of the prison industrial complex, it becomes ripe for corruption and greed.

      When this story first broke, I was looking for statistics on missing children. I was going off a hint from FBIAnon who hinted - 'look what happens to missing children stats after the charities move in to an area'.
     </p>
     <p>
      Anonomized, long-term statistics (eg. x children missing in y place in year z) is difficult to find any data set that is useful for showing anything, let alone trends.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can get crime statistics on shootings, rapes, robberies, drugs, many different crimes, but missing kids stats is another story.

    No one here actually believes a pizza restaurant is involved in human trafficking, do they?

    I could have have sworn this was a joke but it's gone all Poe's Law and I'm concerned people are taking this seriously.

     My theory is that no actual crimes occurred on the Comet premesis, but it is certainly a social and networking hub for the traffickers and clients. It is from this lead that we will find actionable intel.

      makes me wonder if Snowden knew more than he said. his apparent absence from all this seems a little obvious, as well.
