    Some information might be wrong, but this is what I gathered:
   </p>
   <p>
    Hillary Clinton was being exposed by Wikileaks through anonymously submitted emails. These emails are supposedly the ones that she tried to dispose of so that she could not be exposed and arrested. They acquired these emails from the laptop of Anthony Weiner, a person accused of pedophilia and the estranged husband of Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton's closest aid. Huma herself has been connected to the Muslim Brotherhood and the Muslim Sisterhood, which are organizations that fund terrorism along with Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia also funded Hillary's campaign.
   </p>
   <p>
    After Wiener was accused of pedophilia, his computer got taken by the officials and within they found a folder named "Life Insurance" this folder contained all of the deleted emails by Hillary Clinton and more, around 650.000 of them. Anyways, as Wikileaks was exposing Hillary by releasing these emails, one of the emails appeared to have been using code words that do not make any sense within the context that they were used in. These words were the likes of "Pizza" or "hotdog" etc. after people saw these the internet lost it and started digging into this to try to make the proper connections to expose a pedophile child trafficking ring funded by the elite within Washington D.C.
   </p>
   <p>
    Right now there are a bunch of stores that are connected to this investigation that appear to have been funded by the likes of Hillary Clinton, the Podestas and George Soros. Clinton and Podesta are also connected to an "artist" by the name of Marina Abramovic which apparently served them dinner at an event called "spirit cooking" which is nothing short of ritualistic behavior. Podesta is known to have an art collection of absurd nature that could only be described as a fascination with satanism, murder and pedophilia. An email also connects Hillary and Bill Clinton to rich pedophile Jeffrey Epstein who apparently owns an island that he uses in order to allow and have sex with underage individuals. It is thought that Hillary and Bill went to this island with Epstein on his plane they call "Lolita Express". (Funny, right?)
   </p>
   <p>
    They have held fundraisers at the pizza stores and have each other added on twitter. People decided to dig more into these stores to see why these places are so important to the elite. The stores are Besta Pizza, Comet Pizza and We the Pizza, there might be more, but these are the ones I remember. Right off the bat, they have found out that the owners of these places have very weird taste in humor as most of their posts appear to have children in them and have very weird comments. There have also been connections made between the logos of the stores and the pedophile symbols database  provided by the FBI.
   </p>
   <p>
    Extra Buzz:
   </p>
   <p>
    All of this together makes the researchers here think that the elite are part of a child trafficking scandal that abuses children by allowing these people to torture them, rape them and kill them. Hillary and the Podestas are thought to abduct children from Haiti for this purpose also and a researcher who went to Haiti to dig into the child trafficking stories going on in Haiti died not long ago, people assume that she got suicided (murdered). Some think  that the pizza places are cover for the dark things that are happening behind closed doors in order to get dirt on politicians so they can be easily controlled. They think that these politicians are specifically selected to be sick and evil individuals because those above them want people they can control.
