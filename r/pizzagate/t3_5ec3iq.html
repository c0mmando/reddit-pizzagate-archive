        <strong>Archive and The-Big-Picture</strong>
        <p><p>I've been archiving since the first threads on 4/pol/. Here's my most updated archive: 
http://pastebin.com/UwEUyauy</p>
<p>I fully expect this post to get shit on and ignored to hell. Nobody will like this, that's fine. I rarely post on here anyway. I need to post this to clear my conscience, I've become physically ill after dedicating an unhealthy amount of time to this investigation and I need a break. Also side note: I've never seen so much shilling in my life. </p>
<p>I want to see these people pay for their crimes. When something comes out of PizzaGate, it will be blown up by the media to satisfy us superficially, and a controlled opposition movement in the courts will be created. </p>
<p>None of that matters, at all. This level of evil and psychopathy only exists in a society of order followers, in every Satanic ritual abuse case I've studied the police are in on it, because order followers (police and military) are Satanists - whether they like it or not. This is the natural MORAL consequence of the belief in authority, and (the children don't) we deserve EVERY OUNCE of evil that these people reek upon our society.</p>
<p>This scandal is to this day, other than the obvious principles of natural law, is the best evidence that humanity has come to see that the belief in authority creates chaos, and while anarchy has the potential for chaos - it is infinitely more moral and must be embraced. Everything Stefan Molymeme, Mark Passio, Larken Rose said is making sense now. Everything goes back to mistreating children and the belief in ((((religion)))), (((government))), and (((money)))).</p>
<p>Fucking look at us, we are the zombies, the unknowing to these people, who know all kinds of psychology and occult principles we could spend lifetimes figuring out. Government is (((their))) crutch, and is our collective projection of fear of safety and ignorance to natural law. These Dark Luciferian/Satanic/Set fuckers rely on us putting our time (money) into this system that protects them. And you want to know my proof? If their system is so good, you'd send them more and more money right? Yeah, that's why you get taken and put in a cage if you don't send money to the state - and you know what that is, Washington, DC. A fun place we all seem to have just started to pay attention to. </p>
<p>This is human farming, this is matrix tier shit here, and this is only the beginning. Laugh at me, I invite you, because all this VR technology, wifi, pharma drug research, I see it piecing together to this fatherless, weak beta culture and the belief in authority. We have dug ourselves a deep, deep hole, and this is a war of with weapons of blackmail, silence, and seduction. </p>
<p>For now this is another drop in the bucket of historical events that proves anarchy correct. I'll be grooming my 400 lb hacker chest hair for Dorito crumbs, while Mtn Dew pours into my catheter, and I try not to knock off my fedora because of my Katana twirling obsession. Shit on me all you like, I'm not against temporary militias for regional safety, but I expect thousands of boot licking cucks to defend these people somehow. </p>
<p>I love you all, keep fighting the good fight. Just know that what this sub is discovering, is a symptom of a problem, and that problem is not Washington, DC. Its us, its whats in, and whats not in all our heads. And its called the belief in Authority, and the absence of Gnosis.</p></p>

        <p><p>Like it or not, there has to be some form of order to protect a group from others and from themselves. Moderation between anarchy and order through politics is necessary.</p></p>

        <p><p>You're right. We're raised in state schools, so its hard to imagine a world without the state. I think the balance you speak of lays in a system like contributionism or voluntarist societies/guilds that operate through family and contract.</p></p>

        <p><p>There would be evil, powerful people in society regardless of the existence of extent of government power</p></p>
