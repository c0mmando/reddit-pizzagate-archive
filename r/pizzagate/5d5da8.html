    Alefantis speaks - and we need to fire back

   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     '[Alefantis] calls the attackers "conspiracy theorist, white nationalists made up largely of racists, homophobic individuals who loosely tie together theories and do not attempt to find the truth, and when they do find truth that dispels their theories, they ignore it."'
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    I have not seen any political or racist posts here.  I have seen some homophobic stuff that I have down voted and I hope the mods clean up.  However, far more importantly, we have not received any evidence dispelling these theories.  In fact, the more we dig the more we find information that bolsters the theories.
   </p>
   <p>
    To Mr. Alefantis and the Podesta brothers I say: Where is the evidence of your innocence?  Now certainly you are innocent until proven guilty in the court of law, but certainly not in the court of public opinion and we will keep digging to implicate you unless you can provide a real explanation.  Explain the artwork, explain the strange references in the emails, explain why Hillary took such a special interests in Laura Silsby, explain the instagram comments.  You aren't going to use the commonplace tactics of calling us all sorts of names - simply because its not true and the public has gotten use to you and your ilk crying wolf.

    "Conspiracy theorists" - fair enough
   </p>
   <p>
    "Racists" - none of this even had anything to do with race. Most of the presumed abusers are middle aged white people. I guess we hate old white people, but wait! We're also "white nationalists", ok...... Lets also excuse the fact that they're the ones presumed to be taking advantage of kids from 3rd world orphanages.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Homophobic" - we don't like alefantis, who is gay, so therefore we don't like all gays. Fallacy... We dont give a shit who you bang, as long as it's a consenting adult.

     I was reading about a tactic, I forgot what it's called, but you surround yourself with questionable but legitimate things to cover up illegitimate things.
    </p>
    <p>
     So if anyone accuses this pizza place where a lot of gay/transvestites work, of pedophilia, they can just say we are being homophobic.
    </p>
    <p>
     They are allowed to be as sexual as they want in public because any questioning is automatically labeled as right wing/homophobic, not pc.

      I'm preaching to the choir, but some people might not realize that Comet Ping Pong and Besta Pizza were only discovered because of the strange Podesta e-mails.  And then a whole treasure trove of strange "coincidences" popped up, such as the pedophile imagery as described by the unclassified FBI document, the strange art, Heavy Breathing, the curious ties to people surrounding the Clintons, etc.  All of this was only discovered because of the strange, seemingly code-speaking Podesta e-mails.  This is what made me believe the "conspiracy" since there are far, far too many coincidences.

        It's not so much "counter-evidence" as it is debunked evidence that's supposedly the backbone to the whole theory. For example, the Besta guy who supposedly works for the government isn't even the same person. Someone just googled the name and found a government worker named that.
       </p>
       <p>
        There's no evidence for these code words existing. "Cheese pizza" is a code word for sure, but a pretty open one and also one that can refer to the food while talking about food. The rest seem to be made up, and I haven't seen any citation for them prior to pizzagate discussions. I can't find one and no one's shown them. It seems to be made up as a way to say "if we were to define certain terms as this, we could turn this conversation into a sexual one". You can do that with almost anything.
       </p>
       <p>
        The only thing actually from FBI documents are the symbols, and the connection of Comet's to that is very very loose.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other than that, the only evidence I see is that guy liking hipster art. And a couple photos on his Instagram that are either innocuous or easily explainable within other contexts. My only takeaway is that Alefantis is a hipster and an Italian political figure from Chicago likes pizza and other foods. As a New Yorker I can relate.

       Yeah I actually have not heard anyone make any homophobic comments or say anything about transvestites etc working at the place, because as far as I can tell everyone has been concerned with legit connections between gov't tied people and the safety of kids. This is pure deflection.

        This is such a stretch of half truth into a conspiracy it's unbelievable. We have seen alt right say and do anything during 2016, it's really really sad. No one knows what is the truth anymore because definition of truth has changed to include things that you believe even if they are not true. I hate Hillary Clinton so this is not about that. I'm concerned that subs like this one and others are just going to continue saying anything and everything regardless of truth. Of course, if Info Wars and Breitbart tell you something it's automatically true because everything on the internet is true... But you should question them too!

       That type of shit's already popping up on twitter and pedophile apologists are now happening including VICE ppl. It's like, we can prove their syndicate so instead of fighting it they'll try to make the argument that we should be tolerant of pedophiles.

      Yes But combat it easily like this.
     </p>
     <p>
      They are being TRULY homophobic by hiding their outrageous criminal behavior behind a traditional discriminated group.
     </p>
     <p>
      Anti discrimination laws always are aimed at protecting the group and not the individual. So if the individual behaves in a criminal way and tries to shield his behavior behind homophobia then they are adding to the discrimination.
     </p>
     <p>
      Same when Africa American say Nigger. You don't get a pass just because your black.
     </p>
     <p>
      Or a female CEO that refuses to hire women because the silly bitches always get pregnant is obviously still sexist.
     </p>
     <p>
      This is what some Feminists don't get. The individual has no protection it is the group of people that does.
     </p>
     <p>
      In short, call out that shit for what it is.

      That's also because most homos are pedos as well, or were victimized by them at some point in the past.

     If he said something like, "I welcome people to read both sides and come to their own conclusion, because if they did, they'd see the evidence is non-existent," then I'd give him far more credibility.

     Come on man, you should know this already; you can't hate any member of a minority without hating the entire group. Any SJW progressive leftist know this, even though they only use half of their brain.
    </p>
    <p>
     Edit; oh, on topic... I hope Reddit isn't on another witchhunt that ends up like the Boston Marathon fiasco. If he were innocent, although still creepy as fuck, that would be awful considering the accusations levied against him.
    </p>
    <p>
     However I've looked into most of the evidence thus far and I'm pretty sure it's beyond speculation, at this point.

      Yeah I would feel bad if he's innocent as well, but when he acts like this, he should realize it's only going to cause more trouble. He could've said something respectful, but he lashed out. Then again, even if he is innocent, there is discrete proof of him being friends with dirty people like the Podestas and hosting political fundraisers, so he would still not be  entirely innocent of any wrongdoing.

       I have a hard time believing he is innocent as well. It's mostly because of his Instagram though, more so than a lot of other things. The posts he makes are downright creepy, even without context they would be. Regardless if he is innocent or not, he's not someone who should be around children.

        I agree with that. It's also his fucking fault he's on center stage right now. Yeah, let's hide our bathrooms, hang up pedophilic art, put creepy photos of kids on instagram, have pedo symbols everywhere. If he is innocent, I can't help but feel this was one giant publicity stunt to get people to recognize his restaurant. Maybe his ploy was: "if I paint this as a place that is persecuted by the 'alt-right', then business will boom as leftwing sjws form lines out the door."

     It's quite telling that he's parroting the same MSM talking points. Completely adds credibility that he's a pedo. It's hilarious, and then sad and sickening...

     Start any dialogue with them questioning their beliefs and they will bring out the old racist, sexist, homophobe crap.

    It's ridiculous he would bring that up but then not elaborate on the dynamic of his relationship to said minors.

     That's a threat. Everyone should be aware of that. He is subtly suggesting that we are the ones violating children's right and he is connected to people that can turn this thing around on people gathering information. Yes, someone needs to respond with a professional, intelligent response and call him out on this threat.

      I mean I'm not sure what person who isn't a psychopath/pedo will see the logic in his accusations that
      <em>
       WE
      </em>
      are the ones who are sick for reposting pictures of minors
      <strong>
       FROM HIS FUCKING INSTAGRAM.
      </strong>
      Seriously he's basically saying "yeah I posted those photos, but YOU enjoyed it you sick fucks". This guy  is gonna have to try harder than that to shut us up.

        The ironic thing is Jimmy's IG profile picture is a statue of Antinious, the "gay god" who was the castrated 13 yr old boy lover of the 47 year old Ruler of Rome, Hadrian. He was voluntarily sacrificed by drowning in the Nile...He was then reincarnated BY Osiris, the ruler of the underworld and made into a god.

         FACT CHECK:  actually the profile pic is of
         <strong>
          Antinious
         </strong>
         the "gay god" who was the castrated 13 yr old boy lover of the 47 year old Ruler of Rome, Hadrian. He was voluntarily sacrificed by drowning in the Nile...He was then reincarnated BY Osiris, the ruler of the underworld and made into a god. there was even a cult dedicated to him.
        </p>
        <p>
         Antinious was only tied to Osiris by death - as he was sacrificed TO him

           the correlation to Antinious is even more damming than Osiris - knowing that he was a young lover who was sacrificed to the ruler of the underworld....
          </p>
          <p>
           that is way creepier in light of what is going on than a penis eating fish....though im sure that shit takes place as well.

        The ironic thing is Jimmy's IG profile picture is a statue of Antinious, the "gay god" who was the castrated 13 yr old boy lover of the 47 year old Ruler of Rome, Hadrian. He was voluntarily sacrificed by drowning in the Nile...He was then reincarnated BY Osiris, the ruler of the underworld and made into a god.

         Yes, i'm familiar with the Osiris story. The perpetrator of the dismembering was Set, incidentally. Isn't there a Podesta/ Aquino/ temple of Set connection?

           Both of those are bizarre emails that look like a lot of hidden things could be going on. I wish someone had an idea what that list was on the second.

          Makes sense though. It's the kind of vice they'd engage in and most worshipers of "dark" deities like that often get into such things.

           Since the temple of Set was founded by a pedo i guess there's no surprises here.

          Why don't you correct me instead? I don't think it was Osiris, but I know the myth is something like that and it is the same one as connected to jimmys profile pic

      We don't we host silent sit ins at this area in Washington.   Just to put the pressure on them. The fact that he replied at all tells me hes scared.  The usual go to of racism, in response to being called a pedophile is non sequtorial.

          Not all Pagans are evil like these guys. Talmudic Judaism has a lot of things that call for acts like these. Or at least condone them.

            Only Jews and those owned by Jews do this sort of thing.

          Nope. That's proving you're a shill. Jews are not white. They will only claim to be white when the want to admonish whites. They won't claim it if they're under attack by minorities.
         </p>
         <p>
          Name the Jew.

            Genetics are more than skin tone. They're like they because of the Khazar empire and interbreeding with Europeans. But they did it in a way that still leaves the genetic markers for Jewishness. It's why you have to take a DNA test to immigrate to Israel.

       I mean, a response to these kind of allegations is necessary... I was suspicious that they hadn't said anything. It should have been, "We welcome any and all scrutiny of our business and our employees! We stand by our reputation, our food and our practices since we have opened, and we would like to show our support for ending human trafficking by throwing a fundraiser for Polaris on Thanksgiving day." or something like that.

      i guess it's safe to assume that he had some training with real smart,powerful people of the law that told him what to say first. considering his ties to these people are basically a forsaken bond.

     As opposed to posting suggestive images of children to market a "pizza" restaurant. Fascinating use of spin. Can't wait to see the rest.

     It is interesting, psychologically, that his go-to tactic is to discuss using children like "pawns".  It is almost as if he has normalized this type of thinking...

      He's basically trying to gaslight us with a strong side of pulling the victim card. I think we need to avoid all talk of sexual orientation or political party affiliation as being exclusively connected with pedo rings if we want to be taken seriously. They can easily use this against us to derail our efforts.

      Hey, I am nervous to reply bc I am certain I'm going to get jumped on, but you seem like you really do want to hear possible other explanations, so here goes:
     </p>
     <p>
      100% honestly, when I read it it seemed like he and the other dude (the dad of another of the little girls, I believe) were calling each other #hotard.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you look, they're using hashtags like #musthave and #cuteness. Then jimmycomet tags the girl's mom and hashtags #themostexpensiveaccessory, to which another dude replies to Jimmycomet "You are quickly becoming my favorite hashtagger #hotard"
     </p>
     <p>
      Jimmycomet then responds #hotard.
     </p>
     <p>
      I genuinely don't think it was referring to the baby.

       I remember you, you're one of the shills.

       Let's see your explanations for:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        the constant references by Jimmy's crew to the physical beauty of the babies and toddlers
       </li>
       <li>
        the constant use of "must have" when referencing babies and toddlers
       </li>
       <li>
        kill room
       </li>
       <li>
        just rinse it off afterwards
       </li>
       <li>
        chickenlovers
       </li>
       <li>
        gay baby!
       </li>
       <li>
        a "child friendly" establishment using artwork showing adults raping children for its concerts (all ages welcome)
       </li>
       <li>
        Amanda Kleinman at Comet Ping Pong saying "we all have our preferences" when describing the rape of little girls, followed by a man in the audience gleefully shouting out (and presumably wiping drool from his chin) "And little boys too!"
       </li>
       <li>
        Jimmy's pal Podesta having photographs of underage teenagers in his bedroom, along with stuffed animals.
       </li>
       <li>
        Jimmy's pal Podesta having a massive painting of a baby in a diaper on his wall.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I could go on indefinitely here.   You're wasting your time.   The cat's out of the bag.   You sick freaks are going down.

        Happy to. But is it worth it? It doesn't seem to me like you will ever consider another option, even if your quest means harming these kids by doxxing them.
       </p>
       <p>
        -These are his (proven) business partner and friends' children. Of course they're like family. He literally might be their godfather for all we know. Plus, people think babies are cute. Honestly, these explanations are so obvious and you are purposefully ignoring them because they don't fit into your sick narrative.
       </p>
       <p>
        -Again, people think babies are cute and want babies of their own. If I see a puppy I think is cute, I would hashtag must have in a heartbeat. I assume people who like babies are similar.
       </p>
       <p>
        -A dark joke. Have you literally never made a dark humor joke about anything? I make those all the time.
       </p>
       <p>
        -Again, someone responding in kind with dark humor.
       </p>
       <p>
        -This is a man holding his
        <em>
         daughter
        </em>
        . Do you really think that #chickenlovers is more likely to mean he whores his daughter out than perhaps they fucking just ate chicken? How sick are you??
       </p>
       <p>
        -A gay man says gay baby--perhaps he thinks the baby takes after him. This is a joke people make. My cousin is gay and people made that joke when he was young a lot.
       </p>
       <p>
        -Which of the band posters shows adults raping children? And are you that out of touch with the art world?
       </p>
       <p>
        -A bad joke made shortly after the Jared scandal. Yes, it's in very poor taste.
       </p>
       <p>
        -These are famous artists, you uncultured idiot.
       </p>
       <p>
        -Same thing.
       </p>
       <p>
        But no, you're right, I'm totally a shill /s. I created my reddit account years ago and spent time posting inane comments about dogs because I was totally certain I could someday pop up as a shill for this bizarre delusion you have.
       </p>
       <p>
        Or let's look at
        <em>
         you
        </em>
        . Why do you WANT these people to be pedophiles? Why are you trying to force NO evidence to fit the narrative? Why are you supporting the doxxing of children??? Why do you
        <em>
         want
        </em>
        children to be in danger? Are you getting off on this?? You're a sick fuck.

         No.  A comedian making a pedophile joke is in poor paste.   A person whose website features sexualized images of little boys eating carrots, at a pizza joint linked closely to the Podesta brothers, in front of an apparent audience of pedophiles including a man who corrects her (don't forget us boy lovers too!) is horrifying.

         Interesting.   I must be a real philistine, because it never once occurred to me to put a giant picture on my wall of a baby in a diaper with an adult hand reaching toward its crotch.   It also never occurred to me to finance an artist who specializes in pictures of little kids with red bottoms being tied up.

         I most certainly do not.  When the scandal broke I wrote a big post about how the food references probably referred to drugs.   It wasn't 'till I saw Jimmy's bone-chilling Instagram, Podesta's equally bone-chilling art collection and (various other links that have since been exposed) that I realized what was going on.

          Listen, I am trying to appeal to you as a human being: there are other explanations here. The fact that you think "child sex ring" is the most obvious answer is very worrying.
         </p>
         <p>
          The fact that you resort to calling
          <em>
           me
          </em>
          a pedophile is very worrying. I am
          <em>
           concerned that you all are doxxing CHILDREN.
          </em>
          But you don't seem to care--more than anything, you want to be right.
         </p>
         <p>
          And referring to "my buddies" and insinuating that I am part of this: all you are doing is showing your ignorance. Go through my post history. I am a real human who disagrees with you. There are people in the world who disagree with you. I have spent the past 4 days following this sub, and I
          <em>
           still
          </em>
          disagree with you.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you
          <em>
           really
          </em>
          wanted to help these kids, you would
         </p>
         <p>
          1) convince people to stop doxxing them, and
2) explore all the options and possible explanations. Right now you are doing very, very bad "research."
         </p>
         <p>
          You even have factual errors up above. The man in the video does
          <em>
           not
          </em>
          say "don't forget us boy lovers," are you kidding me? The singer makes a joke about what Jared loves, and then man adds "and little boys." And no one said anything about killing kids in the cooler or whatever that is.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you want to investigate, you have to be accurate and you have to accept that people disagree. Your handle on the world is very poor if all you can do is call me a shill. I'm happy to discuss these things with people who really want to investigate accurately and realistically, but you just seem obsessed with pedophilia. If you want to be calm and really discuss the above points without the insults and without the paranoia, let me know.

           If it weren't for people trying to "doxx" these kids they would continue being abused by their "guardians."   Rule of thumb: if you don't want your kids "doxxed" don't post their pictures on Instagram accompanied by bizarre sexualized comments.   Another good idea: don't hang around with people who collect pedophilic artwork.  Yet another good idea: don't post sexually explicit and pedophilic art in your pizza joint then claim it is for "all ages."

           I'm sorry, but the fact that you are so insistent that there is nothing out of the ordinary going on here is a strong indication that you are either a shill, a pedophile or both.

           I just got through using the actual quote ("and little boys").  The comment came after the "artist" said "we all have our preferences" (tee hee pedophilia is a-ok).   Jared wasn't into boys as far as I know.

           BTW, any comment on that "baby...yum" comment?   I've been racking my brain and I can only come up with three explanations: Jimmy's a cannibal, Jimmy's a pedophile, or Jimmy's a pedophilic cannibal.

              So you are telling me it is okay to doxx these little girls? Come on, you've seen recent pictures of them looking happy and in another state, even. With their parents, healthy, and happy. But now with their pictures on line smeared with words like "analingus."

            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              It's okay if you disagree with my assessment of everything, but again, if you really were doing a proper investigation you would look at all angles. But instead, because I disagree with you, you're make the horrible, wildly inaccurate accusation that I am a shill or pedophile. All because I think your evidence is flawed and that I am worried about doxxing children. That means there is no conversation to be had here.

           Nobody has doxxed a child. Jimmy named the children in his public post, or first names from the podesta email.

          <p>
           That's a real factual error, the fact you accuse "you"(who, him literally? the collective subreddit? other sites like 8ch?) of doxxing children.

            Yes, the collective you. None of the instagram photos on their own had the kids' full names. But now there has been at least one post listing each child's full name, and several photos mocked up with the pictures of the children and added layers of ms paint accusations of pedophilia and sexual acts. There is literally a picture of a dad holding his daughter in which someone superimposed the word "analingus."

             You have no idea who made that picture.   For all we know it was made by Jimmy himself as a means of discrediting the people trying to bring him to justice.

           mate i hope you know lots of people agree with you. The fact that these people are calling you shills or a pedo for disagreeing with them is pretty awful/

           You know I never said the baby is gay, right? I said that it's a joke people make--just like in the photo of the baby with the money (takes after you!) People always say babies take after them, and it's always a joke, because yes, it's a baby.
          </p>
          <p>
           "Oh, haha, she's a flirt like her mother!" "Oh, look, she loves her toy truck, she'll grow up to drive pick ups like her dad!"
          </p>
          <p>
           This happens. Y'all are refusing to look at the mundane explanations.

         All of these are actually good points, so thank you. Except for the last 3, though. I'll concede the rest of the points, but a painting being painted by a "famous artist" isn't an explanation. If I can accept your other points, please consider mine as well. Thank you for your contribution to the discussion.

          I'll be 100% honest with you: I don't have as many arguments against the investigations of Podesta. I don't think y'all have a "smoking gun," but I definitely am not against you guys investigating that. And maybe something will be uncovered, and maybe it will be drugs, or god forbid, child trafficking.
         </p>
         <p>
          There has been no evidence about James Alefantis or Comet that I find convincing at all, and it makes me really sad because kids
          <em>
           are
          </em>
          being doxxed with really damaging accusations next to their full names.
         </p>
         <p>
          But yes, I do accept your points. I don't know much about Podesta, and I don't feel like I have an argument "defending" him in particular, and am happy to concede that.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank you for a rational discussion!

             Perhaps the video files have confidential, business-related information.

             Can you point me to this sexually explicit artwork? So far I have only seen band posters.
            </li>
            <li>
             Can you point me specifically to the pedophilic imagery? Because so far I am just seeing hipster stuff. And it seems like many, many bands play at Comet...it seems like a band venue.
            </li>
            <li>
             Do you have evidence of underground tunnels? Are you referring to that one picture with a hole in the ground? Can you a) prove that is at Comet, or b)prove it wasn't to do with plumbing or something mundane?
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            What I mean is exactly what I say: I haven't seen evidence.

             Also added besta pizza (by association with james), you can clearly see the logo was changed from what looked like the boylover logo to a regular triangle. Not evidence against james, but adds credibility that we're onto something.

             There is a (previously) sealed-off underground tunnel passing under the shop. It was for letting water flow. I know I saw a National Geographic video about it. I wish I could find the article.
            </p>
            <p>
             In any case, even this old thread lists a lot of things that go far beyond the realm of credible coincidence.

        <p>
         I'd like to reply to you on a good faith basis point by point having been from the dr pong thread to now.
        </p>
        <p>
         -Granted, I can accept that on it's own calling a toddler/baby cute is just a term of politeness, doesn't necessarily mean anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
         -Babies are human not a pet. You shouldn't want someone elses baby, you should want to create your own. Accepted that it might not literally mean "I want that baby and do dirty things to it because I called it cute"
        </p>
        <p>
         -OK, a joke. I can see that.
        </p>
        <p>
         -Yes, I have made similar jokes (maybe through private messaging not publicly but I'll accept it)
        </p>
        <p>
         -chickenlover is a huge reach. Odd thing to write given its urban meaning, but could be an in-joke between friends or people in on the joke
        </p>
        <p>
         -Odd comment, I'd maybe understand if it's a gay father saying it to his own son, but I'd never say that about a strangers child (or a close friends)
        </p>
        <p>
         -The art could be construed as abstract but it (many images but I'll deal with the main ones)  do depict at the least non consensual sex, with multiple larger figures over a smaller figure and one "laying" on top of the smaller figure. Could be something I don't understand about art, maybe it's an allegory for something
        </p>
        <p>
         -Why is a family friendly ping pong restaurant even hosting comedy, and why does the comedy involve such dark themes? (also, the audience member is obviously very dark too, along with the "rinse it off" friend...seeing a pattern?)
        </p>
        <p>
         -I don't consider it art, but many do. I'll accept it because I don't know enough about it to have an opinion, but I think it's very unnecessary to create art of this type (same way about the performance art where a naked woman shit out eggs filled with paint too, "art") I think you'll find majority of people are "out of touch" with the art displayed. It's so esoteric or abstract that people not involved can't understand it.
        </p>
        <p>
         -Accepted, nirvana had a naked toddler on their album and I view that equally bad but it's an expression of ideas
        </p>
        <p>
         The big issue is, James has a LOT of friends who are making "dark" jokes, all related to child abuse. The instagram commenter, the audience member, the comedian. Fair belief that he is as dark as these people, or he wouldn't associate with them.
        </p>
        <p>
         The bigger issue is, when you add ALL this together it looks more than a few innocent dark jokes and hashtags/pictures or some art misinterpretations.
        </p>
        <p>
         That's what we are looking at. A man with 12 pedophiles in his house isn't necessarily a pedophile himself but he's more likely to be one than the man with 12 non pedophiles in his friend circle.

         James is a man who associates himself willingly with people who make these dark jokes, buy this art. Never would I think to call that out from the audience after that joke. Never would I even think to display that art in my home and definitely not in my family friendly pizza parlor.

         I hope this has opened your eyes and that you aren't a shill. Coincidences exist, but recurring themes aren't coincidences.

          To me, it seems more like people have arrived at a certain conclusion, and are looking at mundane things with suspicious eyes. From my perspective, I have yet to see any kind of evidence or sources that support the doxxing of children. And I would have a lot more faith in this investigation if people were looking at all angles and possibilities.

           I have yet to see any doxing of children. The only names we have of children are the 3 first names from the podesta email, or names Jimmy himself attached to posts of children.
          </p>
          <p>
           Everyone interprets to fit their narrative, that's how people can read the same text (bible is a good example) and argue endlessly about the material.
          </p>
          <p>
           You won't answer some of my points because it'd be absurd to defend 3 shadowy figures looming over a smaller figure whose on a bed with one laying on top of the smaller figure being displayed prominently at a family restaurant.
          </p>
          <p>
           Even if you don't buy into the pedo ring, I'd be nervous walking into a pizza place with my kids and seeing a toddler taped to a table, or the painting they display. That isn't family friendly no matter how you view anything else.

            I'm not going to keep arguing--you've been perfectly polite, but another user has equated me with pedophiles all for disagreeing, and I have yet to see anyone in this investigation look at all angles before coming to a conclusion. Plus, the above doxxing really freaks me out.

             Those names are the ones from James' instagram. The #Carisjames that James posted. You can even see in the images linked next to the names that it's James who named the children in the pictures.

            Interesting. I've heard quite a bit of gay slang, but this does not seem to be commonly used these days. How old are these references?

             Last time I heard mulatto was probably in the 90s, and never by anyone born after 1975. I believe it was used in gay clubs etc in the 70s/80s, usually looking for young looking legal people (twinks would be the term now) but occasionally meant literal underaged people.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's been phased out for sure. It wasn't derogatory back then, it'd be the equivalent of "mixed race" now.

         About a year ago, I asked my mom to go to family counseling with me, because we couldn't communicate well. It wasn't really heated emotional arguments so much as it was an inability to admit wrong doing on either side. I thought so long and so hard about what it was that was stopping our talks, before we ended up going to the counselor, and when we did finally go, he asked us what we thought the problem was. I said "I call it "No,
         <strong>
          you!
         </strong>
         disorder", and then proceeded to explain the argumentative process that I later learned is called "deflection". During a solo session, he said that I had come to a fairly accurate understanding of narcissism, and that he liked the phrase "No,
         <strong>
          you!
         </strong>
         " to describe it.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know you're probably feeling attacked right now, considering the reception you're receiving, but seriously, life is so much better if you start to see this part of you, and take steps to improve. I don't know that I would have ever made any progress without my wonderful psych (had to "upgrade" lol), but I'm sure it's possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         Would you say that you have a hard time experiencing "subtle" emotions? Not understanding them, but maybe you've noticed (it takes self awareness) that you don't feel things as strongly as others, and when you do, it's often "monochromatic", i.e., usually consisting of only one strong emotion? Perhaps you have to be careful not to become addicted to things, as you find the allure of "forceful experiences" to be too great to entertain?
        </p>
        <p>
         I could direct you to some good resources if you'd like to get started.

          Actually, I was using the prior redditor's own method of engaging back on him. If you look at my conversations with anyone who is willing to have a thoughtful discussion--even with disagreements--you'll see that I do just fine being reasonable. I was attempting to satirize the "you disagree, you must be in league with pedophiles" argument, because
          <em>
           anyone
          </em>
          can use it.
         </p>
         <p>
          But this subreddit is full of a really dangerous way of interacting with the world. Essentially, any time someone comes in and disagrees, everyone yells "shill!" Ignoring valid disagreements by attempting to drown out the opposition (or accuse them of aiding pedophiles, as that user did in this case) is so dangerous because it creates a vacuum in which only echoes exist.
         </p>
         <p>
          But, assuming you're being earnest, it's sweet of you to reach out. I'm just fine, but thank you. Perhaps you would like to try helping shogun starship.

           Another trait is the tendency to lump large groups of people together, and hold each of them, individually, accountable for the mistakes of the whole segment. "Normal" people do it, too, and that's where politics comes from I think, but in this case, the guy you're talking to didn't do what you're saying he did, and you did in a more pronounced way. I know you say it was intentional, like in a sarcasm way, but I don't think that's saying all of what happened.
          </p>
          <p>
           We can tell the guy you're fighting with is perhaps a bit too trusting and a bit too reactionary, but he's adamant and passionate about seeing something done about this stuff, and despite the few coincidences that have been thoroughly debunked, the pattern is still, overall, suggesting that things are at best worthy of an investigation, and at worst, a window into the sordid machinations of the ruling elite, of which we have always (we accept the sexual predilections of the rulers in GoT as altogether plausible) known, but never proven. To suggest that the whole thing is silly because you have found a handful of contradictory assumptions among a sea of questionable content is worse than foolhardily seeking the "truth", and honestly, when you go to bat for those who are known to employ shills, you have to expect to be called a shill, and then if it means something to you, you have to persuade with sincerity, never condescension, because you're speaking to a minority (those who might be skeptical) and niceness ingratiates much more effectively than attacking the constituent members for their being members. I think that that's why you're being downvoted, just in a rational way.
          </p>
          <p>
           But anyways, sincerely, I'm glad that none of what I wrote in the last post applied. I would say it's not fun to be this way, but you think you're better than everyone else when you are, and that feels nice. In the end, though, being equal and therefore having relationship is worth more, and besides, only the
           <em>
            betterest
           </em>
           narcissists admit that they're narcissists and then do something about it, like I do.

            Yo, go back and look at his comments. He literally tells me I'm either a shill or a pedophile.

           <p>
            Also, honey, I promise you I don't think I'm better than anyone else. I'm in this sub because kids pictures are being shared in inappropriate ways and I'm upset for them. Again, if you want to go through my profile and see how I interact with people and then you still feel the same way, let me know and I'll listen more carefully.

    Notice how he never denies the allegation of pedophilia. Only deflects the issue by calling us who are digging into it as "conspiracy theorist, white nationalists made up largely of racists, homophobic individuals".

     Let's keep the politics out of it, but i complete agree. I see it as a classic guilty reaction. Being accused of pedophilia is basically the worst thing anyone could accuse you of, like ever. Any sane person would be scrambling to clear their name from any association with the word. And yet he's too busy insulting those who are bringing very serious and substantiated  allegations to the table and somehow.. forgets to address this part at all?

      Trust me, I'm with you on keeping the politics out but these people won't. This is their M.O., insult, rage, divert. This isn't about Trump v. Hillary, Republicans v. Democrats to me. I want all of this shit to be false. But if true, whether it be CPPP directly or someone else discovered during research that has hard evidence, we have to go after it hard because shit will never be the same.
     </p>
     <p>
      Turns out UK has similar stories of child sex trafficking at the highest of parliament and other areas of government. Not to mention the Franklin cover up here in the United States. It's not beyond the realm of possibility that someone in elite class are pedaling similar shit. If found, it must end and they must pay.

       Keep in mind that this rhetoric and narrative was pushed from the top levels of
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       sides to distract away from the real issues and keep people too busy fighting each other and staying divided to pay attention to what's really going on.  Why?  A united country has more power to take down the few in control at the top. All either side has to do is throw out some inflammatory words and shocking news articles about the other side via the MSM and voila, the masses take it from there and do the rest of the work for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this sick shit is true, it is not one party or the other that is involved- it almost certainly at some level a bi-partisan affair. You don't get all the way to the top on either side and know nothing about what goes on behind the scenes when the network is this extensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm with you. Whoever is behind this, if it all comes to light, they must pay.

        I also believe this goes both ways. Like AC/DC's. It's just that right now the Dem's are being connected (in epic fashion) while we know the Rep's go back to the Franklin cover up in the 1980's-1990's but it just happens that the Dem's are the ones running the pedo-syndicate this time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Remember, the UK had the same thing occurred with the highest levels of UK government and politics in the late 60's - 80's (that I'm aware of other than the case from the 1990's with the two kids who were part of satanic rituals that had pedo-sex and baby sacrifices).
       </p>
       <p>
        All of it just leads me to believe that some of the global political elite have been operating a major global underage sex trafficking syndicate for decades.

        For the record, we believe this scandal touches both sides of the aisle. We already know Dennis Hastert was good friends with Podesta. Political affiliation has nothing to do with it.

    Frankly this just goes to show why these people will never go down.  Instead of being smart and collecting evidence and putting the pieces of the puzzle together quietly people started making fucking videos about it and harassing the businesses and people involved.

    Not sure what to make of that.

   <p>
    Like others have pointed out, he only attacks us and doesn't defend himself. Can he explain the instagram account? And he acts like he is more worried about how 'dangerous' and 'filthy' we are as opposed to what this is doing for his business. Who calls someone ACCUSING another of pedophilia the filthy one? We are concerned about the safety of children and he calls us filthy?
   </p>
   <p>
    Can he explain why his 'children friendly' establishment has connections to so many sexualized performances and social media accounts? Why the password protected page on the website? Why have we not been able to crack it...what sort of security measures does a pizza place need, not to mention why are they capable of this.
   </p>
   <p>
    What is the whole thing about prosecuting people? I don't even understand what he means by "stealing of Instagram images, Facebook images of children, minors, aged 5, 7, and 8 years old that are then slapped across their chat boards as nothing but pawns".
   </p>
   <p>
    Now, I'm all for innocent until proven guilty, but you still need to defend yourself instead of shifting blame and making us out to be bad guys.

    I'm new, but I haven't seen anything racist and uh...I'm gay so I know I'm not homophobic ¯\

     A pedantic pedophile who is not used to being called out for his bad behavior on this scale and is reacting emotionally. It's the adult equivalent of "i know u are but what am i?"
    </p>
    <p>
     This is not the reaction of someone who is not guilty. His response seals it for me.

      Seriously, it is more suspicious. If I were accused of something I wouldn't start yelling at them and call them names, I would ask if we could talk like adults and see things from their perspective. Especially if my lively hood was at stake.

       I think the general reaction to being accused of being a pedophile by any rational human would be "You're ducking crazy," not a calm and sedate "What brings you that conclusion?"

     Good point, it is absolutely critical to stay level-headed and keep digging. If anything this is more incentive to keep heading  in this direction.

    It mentions in the article about there being 84 1 star reviews on yelp. I was looking at the Comet Ping Pong Facebook reviews last night and noticed there were about 264 5 star reviews and 84  1 stars. The 84 1 star reviews were recent from people slandering the business for being pedos. However, i check again today and there are all of a sudden an extra 100 5 star reviews, hiding all the negative ones. Should we be calling them out on their fb reviews? i feel like there should be a lot more than 84 1 star reviews. You know, to let the people that dont know, know.

     What good would that do? It's not like eating there even really benefits them if it is as we think it is. Document it and move on, this isn't about reviews for a pizza place.

    What is revealed by this statement is an amusing item.
   </p>
   <p>
    By calling them racist, he just triggered everyone who voted for Trump that was sick of being called racist into believing that he is absolutely, positively guilty.

     Absolutely. What the fuck. We're racist white nationalists because we're accusing a bunch of older white people of crimes against humanity? It triggers the Trump voters AND the Bernie voters who were smeared as racist Bernie bros.

    <p>
     I keep seeing Pizzagate linked to the "alt-right" in news articles, but I'd be curious to know the political affiliation of the many thousands of people investigating and following this story. I'd guess we'd see a lot of people who consider themselves libertarians, progressive leftists, independents, and alt-right people as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm a progressive (former Dem) who long admired some of the implicated politicians and political characters--this story transcends political affiliation. Alefantis, Podesta, et al. are making themselves look more and more corrupt and/or guilty by the day.

     Agreed, the writer's Twitter is

     and Washington City Paper is
     <a href="http://twitter.com/wcp">
      @wcp
     </a>
     . I'd recommend asking why they failed to include some of the disturbing images or that Besta Pizza had a pedophiliac symbol in their logo that was changed after the investigation began. Sending some of these images wouldn't be a bad idea either....

      If you have TOR and are well protected, I encourage you to post the picture of the girl with the taped wrists directly into their twitter feed. They are painting us as "dimwitted trolls" for finding the images disturbing. Let's show them the images. Don't do this if you're not well protected online as they can turn that around on YOU if you're sharing the pictures.

    This article was a waste of time. Just look at the article it references,
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Why, they wondered, did Podesta have a handkerchief with a "pizza-related" map on it? And why did Podesta get so many emails about eating pizza? The answer to
     <strong>
      <em>
       any reasonable person
      </em>
     </strong>
     would be that Podesta eats pizza sometimes. Indeed, Alefantis says, "pizza's always a big thing in politics."
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    That is the most controversial part of the whole email series. There's nothing to ponder over, that's a cryptic message. Could be about sex trafficing/drugs/bribes etc but definitely not about pizza.

     They don't give
     <em>

     ...you can take ANYTHING and twist it around without context, and unfortunately most people don't delve into it enough to form their own thought and just go along with it.

    <p>
     Anyone who hasn't heard about this before that reads that article will think we are crazy because of how they choose to share their information and the fact probably 99% of the people reading it wont actually look into the matter themselves.

     "The most sickening part of this vicious attack has been the stealing of Instagram images, Facebook images of children, minors, aged 5, 7, and 8 years old that are then slapped across their chat boards as nothing but pawns," Alefantis says. "Yes, it’s scary to be attacked, it’s dangerous for business, but it's disgusting and filthy of these people to be posting photos on these websites. ... Someone should be prosecuting these people."
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>

     Alefantis says the photos have been lifted from his personal social media accounts, and those of his friends and employees—not from the restaurant.

   <p>
    Earth to Alefantis and Washington City Paper! WHY is Alefantis and his friends posting disturbing images of infants and children on their instagram and laughing about it?
   </p>
   <p>
    Incredible that the Washington City Paper is completely overlooking this evidence. How can the paper just gloss over that image of a little girl whose wrists are taped to a table? They
    <em>

    about it. Absolutely disgusting!

     It's James Alefantis... He has a police record for a DUI 20 years ago. I, also, cannot believe his parents didn't have the foresight to name him something a bunch of amateur internet detectives would call him a pedophile when he was in his 40's.

      He changed his name long before he was in his 40s. I want to know his birth name, his original name. Do you have proof that he was born J'aime les enfants??

     <p>
      Someone who owns two properties directly next to the CIA can well afford to call himself whatever he wants -- and alter documents to conform to his fantasy name of a child lover.

    Whenever our motives or evidence gets questioned, just tell people to look at Tony Podesta's art collection.
   </p>
   <p>
    In and of itself, Tony's art collection probably won't turn anyone into a rabid conspiracy theorist.  However... Anyone taking a look at Tony Podesta's art collection can't help but raise their eyebrows and wonder how justified the spotlight on Tony is.  Whether from morbid curiousity or a sense of potential outrage, most people seeing Tony Podesta's art collection in context of pedophelia and child trafficking are going to want to know more.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tony Podesta's art collection speaks our argument for us.  We can simply refer people to his collection and let the individual's intellect do the work.  Upon close scrutiny, literally nothing has been found remotely exonerating, justifying or explaining away the original WikiLeak evidence/connections OR the pedo communication/symbols.  PizzaGate might not have a smoking gun
    <em>
     (yet)
    </em>
    , but there's alot of ammo lying around in the form of bizarre coincidences.  Pictures speak a thousand words and Tony Podesta's art collection speaks volumes.

    ALEFANTIS' COMMENTS PROVE THAT HE IS LYING AND HERE IS WHY:
   </p>
   <p>
    **(My commentary is presented in "
    <strong>
     <em>
      xyz comment
     </em>
    </strong>
    ")
   </p>
   <p>
    "The most sickening part of this vicious attack has been the stealing of Instagram images, Facebook images of children, minors, aged 5, 7, and 8 years old that are then slapped across their chat boards as nothing but pawns," (
    <strong>
     <em>
      So James, if you were truly innocent of these allegations, why wouldn't you decry the images as fake?  Instead you say that "instagram images Facebook images of children....are then slapped across their chat boards as nothing but pawns.  This response reaffirms your guilt.  Let me highlight something very important:  you said that "children are slapped across the chat boards as nothing but pawns."  Why would they be "pawns" and not "victims"?  That tells me your opinion on children......mere "pawns".  Secondly, why do you reference "chat boards"?  There is no such thing as a "chat board", or even a "message board" anymore.  Such out of touch language is indicative of you trying to create a conspiracy against yourself out of thin air to damage us citizen journalists who have exposed you.
     </em>
    </strong>
    )    You Mr. Alefantis continue to say: "Yes, it’s scary to be attacked, it’s dangerous for business, but it's disgusting and filthy of these people to be posting photos on these websites. ... Someone should be prosecuting these people."  (
    <strong>
     <em>
      "Why is it "scary" to be attacked, when you having nothing to hide?  A rational response would have been that it was "disturbing" to be attacked...
     </em>
    </strong>
    ) What I'm trying to point out in all this is that Mr. Alefantis was interviewed while his whole entire world was collapsing, and he didn't have the mechanisms in place to properly defend himself, because he knew he was caught.  Let's continue:  This Pedophilia facilitator then goes on to say that ".... it’s dangerous for business, but it's disgusting and filthy of these people to be posting photos on these websites"  (
    <strong>
     <em>
      Why is it "
     </em>
     dangerous*" for business and not "bad" or "terrible" for business?  Was it perhaps dangerous because the revelations of these online investigations will put you in prison for life?
    </strong>
    *)  "It's disgusting and filthy of these people to be posting photos to these websites".  (
    <strong>
     <em>
      &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hold the front door, stop the record, turn the space time continuum upside down......Did you just say that it is "disgusting" and "filthy" of these people to be posting photos to these websites?  Why were they "disgusting" and "filthy", words often used by pedophiles to attack their victims?  And what photos were they "posting" exactly?  If the photos were not real and totally faked in order to ruin your restaurant why wouldn't you say that the photos were "faked" "photoshopped" or "staged"?  Now that you see the semantics here, you can plainly see that this guy is guilty as sin!
     </em>
    </strong>
    )
   </p>
   <p>
    The story stops here right?  Well I assure you friend it does not.  It continues.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Alefantis says the photos have been lifted from his personal social media accounts, and those of his friends and employees—not from the restaurant."  (
    <strong>
     <em>
      Another earth shattering revelation in his own words.  Before he said:  ""The most sickening part of this vicious attack has been the stealing of Instagram images, Facebook images of children, minors, aged 5, 7, and 8 years old that are then slapped across their chat boards as nothing but pawns,", NOW HE SAYS:  "Alefantis says the photos have been lifted from his personal social media accounts, and those of his friends and employees—not from the restaurant. "  So which one is it James, were they stolen from instagram, as "nothing but pawns", OR, were they lifted from your personal social media accounts, "AND THOSE OF HIS FRIENDS AND EMPLOYEES....NOT FROM THE RESTAURANT."  See James, here we see that you caught yourself in a rat trap.  At the top of the article you tried to say that the images were taken from instagram and posted over "chat boards" (
     </em>
     whatever a "chat board" is?), and now you say they were taken from personal social media accounts.  What this tells me is that you were so shocked by the revelation that you were about to be put in prison for life, and that you did not even know how to lie.  The shock was so great, that all rational thinking went by the wayside, and you might as well have been speaking to a hollow microphone.
    </strong>

   <p>
    You sir, are guilty as sin and this article proves it.  Karma is the ultimate law of the Universe, and it just said "gotcha b@$#@".

    Really? There are some here and this isn't the only sub where this pizza stuff gets posted, /r/the_donald is pretty much full of racist kids.

    If you click on usernames here you will find a lot of people that post to very racist subs too.

      I would consider myself left-leaning as well. I do have to agree about the whole /r/the_donald thing, though. It is referenced a lot for stuff about pizzagate and is also flooded with racism which does give him some fuel for that argument unfortunately :/

       I sub and frequent r/the_donald and have yet to see anyone spouting racist remarks, though I've only seen one pizza related thread so I'm not saying it's not possible. Saying it's flooded with racism is farcical though, I agree with everyone saying to leave the politics out of it anyways, we're all here for the safety of these children and that's the most important thing.

        Yeah.  /r/the_donald has had a post regarding this, a pretty lengthy one because it involves Hillary Clinton and the corruption going on in our government.  People in that subreddit want these fuckers exposed, as much as the people here.

        Could be I have only been in the wrong threads in that case. I haven't been there enough to get a large enough sample size tbh.

       <p>
        But yeah, I don't about politics, it is the safety of these kids we want to protect.

        Like I said in a later post below, I will say I haven't been on it enough to have a huge sample size so flooded was probably a bad word to use. I may have just stumbled on the bad ones seeing as other people have pointed out it isn't what they see as a majority.

     Perpetuating the lies of the MSM? While trying to bring pizzagate to light? The_Donald are one of r/pizzagate 's biggest allies. The fact that you insult them despite that fact really shows that you are a very low person.

     You perceive with your mind,

     Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember where the thought is,

    <p>
     I brought all this so you can survive when law is lawless,
    </p>
    <p>
     Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead,
    </p>
    <p>
     No squealing, just remember that it's all in your head~

     Let's use this to our advantage.  I personally have compiled a list of over 30 links and photos to prove The DC Pizza Pedophilia ring.  The comments section on all of these pages are from us, or they are filtered.  Check out the comments section on this article and you will see the truth uprising that is going on:   http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/news/article/20842321/the-consequences-of-pizza-gate-are-real-at-comet-ping-pong                    Notice how the comments, which are speaking the truth, are all "reported".  I have taken screen shots of all the comments and sent them to 15 friends of mine in the Silicon Valley community.  We are keeping a detailed log of everything.  They will not stop us.

    Except from the phrases he used to describe us, its funny because i am fully with him. You guys ignore the truth and run after every single bullshit theorie since days. (Not all of you, but the majority for sure) Focus on what we have guys! Stop running against windmills.

    We need to change the language used so that curious individuals will take this more seriously and continue digging. I recommend reading

     this post

    These fuckers are stupid as they come. They just brought more attention on themselves.

    The old adage goes... any publicity is good publicity. Uninformed people will take notice and ask why he cares so much about "waves in the news". He just shot himself in the foot and now he'll have to limp from the impeding shitstorm.

    The "nail in the coffin" for me was the photo of the baby with euros and the giant grey "hostel" looking room with the #murder comment on it. "just rinse it off when you're done"-----done with what? Murdering kids and disposing of the evidence?

   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Trump supporters on sites like Reddit and 4chan have long been looking for a stronger connection between Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein, a financial tycoon and sex offender whose plane Bill Clinton sometimes used. The Wikileaks release of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta's hacked emails inspired a feverish, and mostly hapless, search for salacious scandal evidence, while PolitiFact calls the evidence for a Clinton sex network "ridiculously thin."&gt;

     I don't trust rigged media outlets like "Politifact".   I sent a two page email to Snopes calling them out for trying to discredit journalist James O'Keefe for his Project Veritas videos.  They offered no facts other than that he had to settle with ACORN, the group who he previously exposed.  I proceeded to email them twice more, and I did not receive one response.  In short, don't take what you read on "skeptic" sites, which are front sites for the mainstream media to filter truth, as truth itself.

    Typical and overused tactics straight from the book of CTR. Attempt to discredit the thing by calling its community "racists", "homophobes", "fascists", etc. making yourself look like the victim in the process, rather than actually attempting to dispel any of the things we think of as evidence against them. His so called "innocent personal pictures with children" that we posted include a girl that has her wrists taped to the table, for goodness' sake. It's not like they're birthday pictures or anything. He has to be connected with the newspaper somehow because no proper journalist could gloss over this type of stuff.
   </p>
   <p>
    Him actually replying to this means that he thinks it got big enough for him to risk bringing even more attention to Pizzagate by addressing it in the first place, and he's right in that it did get huge, to say the least. I'm from Turkey, and even my classroom's WhatsApp group is full of discussion about Pizzagate. Him addressing it has to mean we're doing something right.

     That news story is
     <strong>
      that alt right conspiracy theorists
     </strong>
     have pegged the 10-year-old neighborhood pizza restaurant as both a pedophiliac sex ring and the meeting ground of a satanic cult—all based on an email exchange between Comet Ping Pong owner James Alefantis and Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta that surfaced in the latest Wikileaks dump.  [...] Despite the fact that the election is over,
     <strong>
      the alt right internet trash talk

     hasn't ceased.

    4chan found an article from 2008 about Comet Ping Pong. Apologies if it's all ready been discussed.

    When they start calling names without providing reasoned, logical responses and defenses, you know we are on the right track. There really is no defending the sickening pictures and comments we have already uncovered. They are trying to go private with what they once flaunted, changing their logos, and editing their websites, but our citizen journalists have captured and archived their heinous activities that they cannot undo. Godspeed to all as I am more and more convinced that we are in the middle of the hornet's nest, with CP (many meanings in this case) being at the epicenter.

    This article is an incredible piece of propaganda. To the uninitiated, who would assume at first glance that a well-established restauranteur is respectable by default, the wording here would clearly put the assumption of pedophilia on the conspiracy theorists. They are the ones plastering the photos of young children on the internet. This is the exact opposite of what we know, factually to be true. Alefantis plastered these photos of children on his public instagram account and encouraged his degenerate pervert friends to comment on them. Publicly. I would love to continue the interview and ask "And what exactly did you mean by your comment using the hashtag #chickenlover as it pertains to this man holding a young child?"

    This article is an epic snowjob that, very tellingly, attempts to completely turn the tables on the crowd-sourced investigation, accusing us of alterior political motives and pedophilia. If anything, this is further confirmation of the veracity behind the dark implications of the material we have seen. God help these children, and give them justice.
