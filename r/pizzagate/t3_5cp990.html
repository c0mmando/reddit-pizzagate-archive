        <strong>Still having trouble putting all the pieces together.</strong>
        <p><p>I've spent a good 10 or so hours in the last few days going over a lot of the theories and posts. There is a lot of <em>circumstantial</em> evidence but I still haven't found my personal "Smoking Gun" yet. </p>
<p>There is a lot of weird coincidences, absolutely. As another redditor posed, "at what point to coincidences stop being coincidences?". </p>
<p>I absolutely believe thing like pedophilia rings happen. We know that from the Dutroux affair and others like it. The unfortunate truth is, there is probably a ring like it presently in the U.S. Government. I just don't know if we're on to it.</p>
<p>Side note: I hold the value of hard evidence to be significantly higher than that of circumstantial; Why I believe that Amanda Knox and Casey Anthony didn't do the crimes that they were accused of. That's a side note, I'm not trying to derail the conversation with an discussion of those two.</p>
<p>Here is my issues with the research so far;</p>
<p><strong>Podesta's Jeffrey Dahmer Portrait</strong></p>
<p>This is creepy, don't get me wrong, but I haven't seen anything that from the artist that indicates it was modeled after Dahmer victims. Seems to be an unfortunate coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>Marina Abramovic and Spirit Cooking</strong></p>
<p>I think people's perspective on her is tied to whether they were aware of her before the email leaks or not. I watched the documentary on her about a year and a half ago, and it seems that others who were familiar with her "art" before the emails agree that this is a weak link at best. It's just pushing edgy shit to get a reaction, like jump scares. Some people really go for that. Kinda dumb imo but maybe I'm not sophisticated enough. Regardless, it's not really a tie to anything nefarious. </p>
<p><strong>Assuming Aesthetic = Indicative of Evil</strong></p>
<p>Granted I've only seen one post like this but it was pretty substantially upvoted (like 120). I think it was a comment instead of a post, I'll try to search my history to link it if anyone is curious. For clarification, I came to Reddit earlier this year after many years on tumblr before leaving because of how toxic it had become. "Aesthetic" is almost a meme there. All those posts on Comet Ping Pong's tumblr just seem normal (well, normal as far as what gets posted on tumblr) to me. To a lesser extent I think the same of the guy's instagram but it is a little different. I'll get to that later. </p>
<p><strong>Madeline McCann</strong></p>
<p>No no no no no this is so gross. The ages do not mesh at all. Further more, that infographic put forth that compares the Podesta brothers is misleading. The drawings are of the same person seen by two different witnesses. This is cleverly addressed in the infographic by having "person/s". Clever. Misleading though. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann#Smith_sighting">link</a></p>
<p><strong>The Cheese Email</strong></p>
<p>Guys, he got a cheese tray. Extremely strange wording. If it were me I'd be like "thanks for the cheese" but yeah. I don't think this was anything malicious. </p>
<p><strong>Child Pornography = CP = Cheese Pizza</strong>
Okay, I admit that I've never made a post on 4chan or 8chan and frankly do not know how that site works exactly. I had never heard of Cheese Pizza = Child Pornography before this came to light a few days ago. From what I understand, this nickname came from 4chan (if I'm wrong, please correct me, this doesn't seem to be discussed much). If this is true, is it the general consensus that Podesta uses 4-chan? That seems weird to me. Has the term Pizza to mean CP progressed to being used off of those sites? I just find it hard to believe that these politicians who presumably do not venture to the depths of the internet very often would know what it meant, because I sure as fuck didn't. </p>
<p>Those are my big problems with the allegations made so far. Here are things that are suspicious as fuck and ideas to what can be looked into to further the research. </p>
<p><strong>Can anyone investigate the artist of the "Dahmer" sculpture to see what the inspiration was?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pizza-related Map email</strong></p>
<p>This is realllyyy strange. I can't come up with a scenario that makes more sense than the theory presented in this subreddit. How is a handkerchief pizza related outside of the context of pedo related?? I can't come up with a scenario for that, other than poorly worded. And then guy doesn't address the handkerchief in the following email? That is odd. Kim Noble/Ria Pratt's artwork depicting handkerchiefs under abuse victims is haunting, but I can't find any more evidence of that being a common point in ritual/pedophiliac abuse. Maybe we insert more time into researching that? </p>
<p><strong>Changing the Besta Pizza Logo</strong></p>
<p>Until this happened, I was 100% on the "this is all tin foil hat shit". But holy shit. Not to offend, but this subreddit is not that big. There is no widespread discussion of this in the media or on facebook as far as I can see. Why change it to appease a few faceless members that are more than likely to not be in your city? Unless you had something to hide.</p>
<p>Basically, I'm in a weird position of not believing about 80% of the allegations made but that last 20% makes A LOT of sense. Is there anything I'm missing that proves this stuff is happening?</p>
<p>EDIT: Formatting</p></p>

        <p><p>I hope this gets more visibility.</p>
<p>We are obviously not trained investigators - and reddit has had its mistakes when investigating situations.</p>
<p>I think you have good points and a critical eye.</p>
<p>I never really understood the connection to Jeffrey Dahmer either - seems like a big jump.  Conversely no matter which way you put it, Marina Abromovic is wacky and engages in ritualistic activities.  I get you call her an "edgy" artist, which I've seen my fair share of, but she focuses on blood and pain.  Maybe I'm making an assumption, but I believe her real personality is similar to her artist persona - which makes you question the type of person who would spend time with her.</p>
<p>As far as Madeline McCann goes, this makes sense to me.  Anthony and John are brothers - and obviously look alike.  The fact that the drawings look like both brothers, lends to the idea that the major characteristic of the Podestas were present.  If John and Anthony were not related that would completely discredit the theory.  The fact that they are related I think strengthens the research. </p>
<p>I'm not sure where Cheesy Pizza came from either.  I have a feeling it went like this </p>
<p>"Why does Podesta talk about Pizza so much"</p>
<p>"Why does Podesta use the word Pizza in this phrasing / context"</p>
<p>"Podesta seems to be linked to really weird people"</p>
<p>"It seems these people are engaging in some sort of child abuse / pedophilia"</p>
<p>"Oooohh, Pizza must mean CP, it all makes sense"</p>
<p>Thats not to say that Pizza and CP are not related, but no one has actually shown me evidence of the existence of that code word.  I tried looking it up as well and couldn't really find anything.  I think its important to remain skeptical of all research and not blindly believe any connection that is made, solely because it fits with the narrative.</p></p>

        <p><p>I personally think that these people are creepy as hell. HOWEVER, I too want evidence before I believe anything. That's exactly why I go nvolved with the leaks in the first place. Keep me in the loop</p></p>

        <p><p>I too am incredibly skeptical of reddits private investigations, especially after the infamous Boston bombings incident. </p>
<p>The Besta pizza logo change isn't suspicious at all to me. It wouldn't exactly be surprising that somebody connected with the company would hear about this somehow, and forward the message "our logo looks sort of like a pedophile symbol, we should change that". It's also a triangle with a spiral. It's pretty hard for it <em>not</em> to look similar. To me that's one of the weakest pieces of "evidence" I've read. Three separate pedophiles in the same ring managed to buy three adjacent properties and successfully maintain three businesses? Thats way more unlikely than "we used a triangle for a logo". (also for a pizza shop, triangles are pretty relevant) </p>
<p>The pizza-map thing is weird as hell though. What the hell is a pizza map? </p></p>

        <p><p>"Either the pedo ring is real, or there is an avalanche of unexplainable coincidences that I cannot find a skeptically-satisfying, innocent answer for. The pedo ring is a skeleton key for an otherwise impossibly confusing set of circumstances, events, logos, emails, etc."</p>
<p>Quote from another thread. I'm just very confused. I think a lot of the "evidence" is borderline non-nonsensical, but some things are making too much sense. I'm trying not to get totally sucked into it, but with Julian Assange having no proof of life for a while now, and the new developments with Monica Peterson, I'm struggling with not jumping off the deep end here. </p></p>

        <p><p>That's a fair point. </p>
<p>I was just surprised that it happened so quickly and without fanfare. No public address to the change. </p>
<p>But you are 100% right, that is an explanation for changing it. I am surprised they heard about it so quickly though, because I was under the impression Pizzagate was still relatively unknown. In my, speculative, opinion, it's suspicious that they changed it. You'd get a delta in CMV though. </p></p>
