        <strong>I am sick to my stomach... what the hell are these people DOING?!!</strong>
        <p><p>A previous thread has been investigating Rachel Chandler. (public figure)</p>
<p>Rachel Chandler was a frequent flyer on Jeffrey Epstein's "Lolita Express." (public figure)</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Epstein is a convicted pedophile. His home was found to have eerie photos of unclothed young people, and a chair with working drills and sharp instruments. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3688656/A-fully-equipped-dentist-s-chair-close-photos-young-girls-backsides-eerie-images-videotaped-walk-billionaire-pedophile-Jeffrey-Epstein-s-Florida-mansion.html</p>
<p>Rachel Chandler has also been pictured with Bill Clinton (public figure). Recently her Tumblr account was discovered. http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/98672570</p>
<p>The Anon who saw her account noted something very strange. Another account called "Just like heaven" has been sharing her photos. </p>
<p>And an additional account, "Gender Abused" has also been linked in the mix.  </p>
<p><strong><em>What you are about to see is extremely troubling. There are multiple photos of children, and other frightening images (you have been warned). Screen caps are here (again - DO NOT LOOK AT THIS IF YOU DON'T NEED TO)</em></strong> http://imgur.com/a/9l5a5</p>
<p>Who is "just like heaven" and why were they linking Rachel's photos? Here is the full tumblr (you have been warned): http://nqbs.tumblr.com/post/152846244883</p></p>

        <p><p>This is some twisted shit, definitely warrants an investigation. I would say don't be shocked if it's some edgelord gender studies tard who finds these pics across the net, but yeah, definitely warrants investigating</p></p>

        <p><p>Why is <a href="https://wiki.puella-magi.net/Nagisa_Momoe">Momoe</a> in a pentagram surrounded by <a href="http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Madoka">Madoka</a> and <a href="http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Homura_Akemi">Homura</a> figurines and a <a href="http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Mami_Tomoe">Tomoe</a> sticker?</p>
<p>Probably because they made a PS Vita game called "Madoka Magica: The Battle Pentagram"</p>
<p>And its not really uncommon for die-hard anime fans (read: otakus/weaboos) to make shrines for their favorite characters. While I do think PizzaGate is a more than likely real thing, I think that last post is a stretch. Especially so because Madoka Magica is definitely not a kid friendly show.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is just edgy douche bags being edgy.  Every single pic is either depressing, edgy or gore.  I guarantee if you went to /b/ right now you would see all this shit.</p></p>

        <p><p>Gender Abused ain't shit. Likely just a random Tumblr kid (people we definitely don't want to alienate) since I see all this stuff on there all the time, plus the last pic is shit I've seen many wannabe occultist weaboos do.</p></p>
