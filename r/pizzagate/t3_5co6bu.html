        <p><p>This woman is comment on all of Jimmy's posts and while not as blatant, she's on the inner circle with the whole lot of them.</p>
<p>Have her LinkedIn details, connection to Jimmy's birthday partys (2 weeks ago) and a few other chaps in the photos (not sure who they are?).</p>
<p>These people NEED to be questioned.</p>
<p>The worrying thing here is the connection to the NPH Mexico organisation. The toothbrush image was disgusting. It's subtle, but horrible to think.</p></p>

        <p><p>Thank you for posing this.  This proves our point that Buck's Fishing and Camping, like Comet Ping Pong, are nothing more than front operations.  Why on earth would a company like Kaze Design work for Media Matter of America, one of the largest PACs in the country, Phizer, and then some "boutique" clothing shop like Buck's Fishing and Camping.  It doesn't make sense.  No large brand or design company would put their reputation at risk by dealing with boutique clients, unless they were a non profit.  </p>
<p>What I think is really happening:  George Soros and democratic power brokers like John and Tony Podesta have been setting up a clever front operation for their pedo ring by combining "mom and pop" safe houses like Comet Ping Pong and Buck's Fishing and Camping with their political infrastructure.  If anyone asked, Podesta, Soros and others would say they were trying to "help the local community".  But with any large scale organization, policing is difficult, and in this case, Mr. Alefantis really went off the rails.  Now their whole world is about to come crashing down.  </p></p>

        <p><p>On the last photo a person named "mzhaft" comments.  The twitter username "mzhaft" shows up as the name Mary Haft.  A google search listed her in DC as the board of directors - http://www.penfaulkner.org/about/board-of-directors-2/<br>
Looks like her husband is Robert, who started the Crown Book Chain.
"After getting an M.B.A. from Harvard, Robert joined in 1977 and soon founded Crown Books."<br>
also looks like they have their own foundation:<br>
