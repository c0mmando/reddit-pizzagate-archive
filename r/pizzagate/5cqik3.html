    Need digging into and archiving a website that is a MENU OF CHILDREN!!!
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit for clarity: THIS is the archived link to the page that I need help digging through and archiving. Benetton kids page.
   </p>
   <p>
    https://archive.is/lkGGc
   </p>
   <p>
    This
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5clw02/new_these_are_all_of_the_restaurant_websites/">
     pizza gate thread
    </a>
    shows how a lot of other restaurant websites originate from the same IP address as the website from mybestapizza.com.
   </p>
   <p>
    After digging through http://www.tenutaspizza.com/ I found the owners Facebook page. He and his friends are very weird, but one particular post raised my attention. His public posts showed he liked this page:
   </p>
   <p>
    http://kids.benetton.com.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here is archived link: 
https://archive.is/lkGGc
   </p>
   <p>
    This website is a menu of children.
   </p>
   <p>
    Please dig around and archive everything. Pay particular attention to the "Your drawings" and "Recipes" pages, as well the "Community" which includes photos of children.
   </p>
   <p>
    Community archived page 1:
   </p>
   <p>
    https://archive.is/ty3At
   </p>
   <p>
    I have archived some stuff, but need help as it is never ending.
   </p>
   <p>
    The recipe page is weird. Here is an example of one recipe, called "Pasta with soft fresh cheese and rocket."
   </p>
   <p>
    https://archive.is/gGalT
   </p>
   <p>
    Here is page under drawings, which shows creepy photos of a girl lined up with dolls and a picture of her rolling pizza dough:
   </p>
   <p>
    https://archive.is/92wlW
   </p>
   <p>
    Here is another "drawings" page. Note the girl eating pizza.
   </p>
   <p>
    https://archive.is/c0f7i
   </p>
   <p>
    There are videos and storybooks available for download. I have only started to delve into that, and they need to be downloaded and archived by someone using TOR and multiple VPNS onto a sandboxed device as to not infect your system with malware.
   </p>
   <p>
    This website is associated with the clothing company, United Colors of Benetton. 
~~Although you won't find a link from the official UCOB website to "Kids" page. At least not one that I could find.~~ Yes, UCOB appears to run this site.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have no idea how deep this hole goes, but we may also want to look into connections between the clothing company and the rest of pizzagate.
   </p>
   <p>
    Also, please cross share any info you find into /pol/ threads. Thank you for your help.
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit: I apologize for spelling and grammar errors. I have limited time today.

    This is suppose to be a site where kids can sign up.  But it does seem a bit weird based on the kids photos and that they are like 5 years old.  We should be checking missing kids in those areas to see if there is any cross references.

        So go check it yourself or be clearer with which files we should check and how we should check them.

        Please do not just copy and paste numbers and file names again without context or instruction. We want to help but need you to help us help you.

    Who called it Pizza cheese instead of cheese pizza? Very weird.
   </p>
   <p>
    Also I noticed a lot of these posts &amp; promos include "12". Maybe 12 year old?

    I don't see any problem with this site, and they have press-release http://www.benettongroup.com/media-press/press-releases-and-statements/benetton-kids-community-united-colors-of-benetton-launches-a-new-online-community-for-children/

     Although it looks like normal page, after you really start digging it gets quite odd. Remember these people like to "hide in plain site."
    </p>
    <p>
     When you start looking through the community pages, some of the pics of the kids are quite weird. Sometimes the same child is listed under multiple names.  Here is one example. https://archive.is/Ubawt
    </p>
    <p>
     I am going to keep digging but I bet there is a connection between UCOB and Clinton foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Edit: Also on this link, The girl named "Trinity" is wearing heavy makeup/ eyeshadow. A bit odd.

      Definitely not normal, I don't understand why it's so hard for people to read between the lines. It's not like they're gonna say buy children here so you can fuck them. Once you know what to look for, we'll realize that there are tons of these sites. Here's another one http://lesliecashen.com/www.lesliecashen.com/children.html. I'm guessing there are thousands of sites like these.

       I agree it's good to focus on the Jimmy Comet and Podestas as a key point to bring down first. But yeah this thing is huge and global.

       I see nothing wrong with that website. You can't just start making random connections. It's just pictures of children with their families for christ's sake.

       I'm on your side, but "reading between the lines" is not how the law works, or should work.  There needs to be concrete evidence.

        That's very true, and why I asked for help digging. To get more evidence. I need help though. I can't go through every page by myself, and also I'm sure there are a lot of people that have more skill than I do, in a lot of areas.

      I'm inclined to believe those are probably twins, rather than two of the same girl.

       You might be right, but there are a lot of other examples. Just quickly looking, all three of these pictures look to me like it's the same girl. I noticed more, but don't have time to dig right now.

     That doesn't look like an old fat guy. That is a lady's white sweater. It's probably her mom.

     Her eyes also have bags that a kid's eyes shouldn't normally have. Just like that little girl's eyes who was tied to the table @ Comet Ping Pong.

     Nice catch on the bruise. It looks like the bruise was quite large and severe at first, and now is in the process of healing.

       There's something here, but you also have a ton of people involved who know nothing about investigating or research, and they are on a wild goose chase desperately trying to draw connections.   Ignore the speculation and focus on the connections that match fbi investigations

      Could be code for something. More likely just greens though.

    Link to Tenuta's Pizza owner facebook page so others can look at it? Also you twice misspelled Benneton as Bennington and Benninton. I get that is a small detail and I'm not trying to nitpick you but this post is taking people down another long, complicated path.

     I am not going to directly link his Facebook page for now. This leads to idiots making comments on their social media profiles, and then it tips the person off and they tighten their privacy preferences and delete evidence. It could also cause them to panic, which may endanger victims. If you dig around, it's not that hard to find.

      I went to the places website and tried searching the owners name on facebook, and found nothing. I agree about not posting a link to it, but can you give any other hints on trying to find it? Did I do what you did?

       Oh wow. Okay, so on the About page, they say they also own "Derango The Pizza King", which they link to. I was able to access it a few days ago, but just now, when I tried to click on the link, it says the server cannot be found. The owners information was on that page. Unfortunately, I didn't get an archive. This is a bit unsettling.

        There were at least a couple links in your post that I clicked on about 5 minutes ago that looked archived and gave me a server error as well. Something else to consider is this other

    , like many others I saw, has his age listed as 6, but looks 3 in all his pictures, and if he is 3, what need would he have of an online community like this in the first place? As if there's just millions of 3-4 years old clamoring to get online before they can even write/read.

    <em>
     What is it?
Benetton Kids Community is the new, fun website created especially for children and families.
It is a safe place where children can share their favourite photos and drawings, somewhere 
they can play, read and be creative, even in the kitchen, by preparing the organic-based 
recipes with their mums and dads.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     This is supposed to be a "community" for kids to post their favorite photos and drawings.
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     How to take part
To join the Community, parents need to register by completing the online form. 
Each parent can enrol from 1 to 3 children: kids who partecipate in the Community can be up to 12 years old. 
Every child's profile can be filled with a maximum combination of 12 pictures and drawings.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    The kids have to be UNDER 12...further,
    <strong>
     I haven't seen a single drawing yet
    </strong>
    on any of these profiles. It's all just pictures of little kids, and many of them look to have the face of exhaustion. Also notice the terrible spelling and grammar.
   </p>
   <p>
    I am seeing several kids with cuts, bruises, and other signs of injury on their faces.

     That's called a "stork bite". It's a birth mark many kids are born with that goes away with age. This whole sub has lost its mind.

    The United Colors of Benneton Label is a legit fashion group.
They raised awareness with some advertising back then though, I think it involved AIDS victims iirc.

     I think we a bit beyond basing their profile on the charity work they have been doing. Dont forget. They gave the whole world AIDs this group. Not to say anything about UCB but I gotta say the dude with the pizza on his dick on the front of their magazine is definately something wierd.

    The recipes have separate columns for school and nursery. Which makes some sense... but why not just make the recipe and have different weight amounts, of the whole recipe, given to different age groups.

   <p>
    http://archive.is/sGlMi for example. The pasta to yogurt ratio is the same for both the school and nursery amounts, but the parmesan cheese ratios wouldn't match (7 and 6 grams respectively). The measurements are in grams (g's, grand?), I think I remember reading the company was italian based, so that is sensible. Possibly $7000 and $6000? I understand that this small of a difference in ingredient ratios wouldn't affect the overall dish by much, I took notice though and figured I would share.

    Opinions? I checked a few recipes and it seemed to be similar. Maybe some of you guys can dig through some more.

     Quick Google search suggests that "undercolors" is their underwear line. The privacy policy actually links directly to https://us.benetton.com, but the default page is the Girls section. The privacy policy can be found embedded at the bottom of the page.

    "MENU OF CHILDREN."  At this point, that seems very tenuous.  Keep digging, by all means, but be careful about getting overzealous about something that could be nothing.  We don't want to get threatened with a lawsuit and get the subreddit banned.

    Potential shill alert.

    This has no connection to pizzagate at all.
   </p>

    It's no revelation that kids like pizza, so merely seeing children in the same context as pizza means NOTHING.

     Did you even look at any of the content they posted? Did you go to any of the links? This is quite a bit more than "children in the same context as pizza".
