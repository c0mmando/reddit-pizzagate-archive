        <strong>Art, money laundering and the Podesta inc</strong>
        <p><p>I have noticed an underlying and systematic method that all the people involved in Pedophilia and John Podesta move money around. They all own, buy and trade expensive artworks. </p>
<p>I read money years ago that art is the best way to launder money and hide it from detection.</p>
<p>I also read that Podesta owns a vast collection of artworks. Storing money in art is a tactic that has been used because it it impossible to get an idea of its value as it is arbitrary. The Vatican church hordes expensive art which is part of their hidden wealth.</p></p>
