        <strong>How can we investigate if they are possibly eating, cooking, and/or serving the babies/children without forensics?</strong>
        <p><p>I was just thinking last night about how there is so much reference to cannibalism like at the Marina Abramovic gala plus all the cooking references in the emails, that there's a good chance they are eating the babies and children. Maybe even serving it in food at places like Comet Ping Pong. </p>
<p>However, without forensics how can we test this theory? Any ideas?</p>
<p>I did have an idea that wood burning pizza ovens are perfect for burning bodies. Sorry this is so grim, but maybe someone should look into wood burning pizza places and see if there's any connections there.</p></p>

        <p><p>I searched "oven" in the podesta emails and found this thread of emails where this person Ashok says they want to cook dinner at Podesta's house (I find it a bit odd they say they will cook at his house rather than offer to cook at their own) and talk about cooking some of the menu in the "pizza oven." Podesta asks if they want to use the "outdoor pizza oven."</p>
<p>So Podesta has an outdoor pizza oven at this house plus Comet Ping Pong as a wood burning pizza oven. Could be nothing or it could be how they hide thousands of their victims!</p>
<p>EDIT: Here is the link to the email...https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/54387</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah i also came across references to the imported Italian pizza oven Comet has and how Podesta loved it and has an outdoor version himself.</p></p>

        <p><p>There are videos and documentaries going as far back as the 80s with first hand accounts from children describing how the kill and eat babies.  Personally i need more evidence than that to believe it definitively but i am not ready to completely dismiss it either.  How else do you hide 200k dead kids a year?</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, you can get prion diseases from eating meat contaminated with brain matter if that brain matter has malformed proteins in it (prions).  Eating the brains of younger children or babies supposedly significantly reduces the risk of prion diseases.</p>
<p>Reasons for eating kids though?  Well, i know some of these people believe that ingesting the blood and body of children helps keep them young.  It's a good way to dispose of bodies.  It's a way to maintain control via blackmail.  Im sure there are a few others....</p></p>

        <p><p>Kuru, yeah. That's the disease that comes from eating infected brain tissue. There is a theory that Hillary is suffering from this. My money is on parkinson's at they moment, but to be honest I wouldn't rule it out. </p></p>

        <p><p>I've been digging around in the pizza oven idea for a while. It may interest you to know that when you look up cremation it is repeatedly compared to a pizza oven. Even the urban dictionary entry for a crematorium is "clinical pizza oven". The one distinguishing feature i've seen mentioned is that a crematory oven must have a "special" smoke stack for regulations. I am not sure if that would look very different than a pizza oven smoke stack but i've been hunting for a back side view of Comet to see where it exits. I have seen the smoke pipe inside portion but don't really know the difference i'm looking for if there is one to see.</p></p>
