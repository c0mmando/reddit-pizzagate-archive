    I've been following this since the emails were first leaked and have read tons of emails with the references, links, ties, etc. to businesses and government officials. I personally can't prove or disprove any of it but the amount of evidence is so monumental in proving that there is a very well coordinated child sex ring that it makes me wonder how not a single person that would have concrete evidence this is going on has not said anything. I can understand the repercussions of leaking such damning information to the public but it would be for the greater good of the country and world. They need to be brought down. I hope the people here and on 4chan can continue and shed more light on this problem.
   </p>
   <p>
    The way they talk about pizza in the emails, I'm sorry NO ONE talks like that. It's unsettling and disturbing. I wouldn't put it past the wealthy to be involved in something as sick as this. Good luck to all.

    You're also talking about an all-or-nothing occult sex/death cult.

    Well they would have to provide concrete evidence otherwise they'd be risking their life for no reason.

    There have been many many many whistleblowers but they have all been ignored. Look up the Franklin cover up.

    If you read up on the Australian girl who claimed to be raped by Nixon on an Australian military base she was shown a video of a man being pulled apart by two tractors and told that is what would happen to her if she told anyone.

    This case is too deep for one bombshell wistleblow. It would take down the door, not the whole house. Aside of the fact that people are ending up dead.

    It should be noted that the FBI has the same information we do. These things take longer than you can imagine.

    Maybe because they aren't running a pedophilia ring out of a small pizza shop?  Do you seriously think these people can't afford a house or warehouse or storage space for their activities?  Or that they would risk operating something like that from their own damn business?
