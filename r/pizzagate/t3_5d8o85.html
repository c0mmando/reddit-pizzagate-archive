        <p><p>in the comments she writes this: "I think you need to educate yourself. I was targeted because I am Jewish and a female. I am an artist and musician. WHAT A THREAT!"
she cannot be fucking serious. yeah that is exactly the reason why she is receiving all the these comments</p></p>

        <p><p>Exactly, </p>
<p><strong>Sounds like a CTR tactic to make the accusations seem crazy.</strong> it works because some of the more explosive claim are easy to pick apart and distract from basic questions of fact</p>
<p>I wonder how that one guy on her Facebook page knew she was jewish anyway.</p>
<p>And why is she calling it a conspiracy theory when  it basically involves questioning her choice of "ART" and choice of venue and associates.</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>Nobody on here even knew the jewish part or cared about gender, just the words we heard. These people will find ways to deflect anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, let's look at some of the comments on just one Heavy Breathing video on Youtube:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This video is the ideal Jewish utopia, everybody.
ROUNDING UP AND KILLING THESE ROACHES WILL BE EXTREMELY FUN </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jewish slut. You will be the first we gas.﻿</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey stupid bitch. We're onto you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More "art" by Jewish pedophiles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There might well be paedophiles of all creeds, but there's decent evidence the Jews run the show. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>.... so yeah it seems like there was a lot of anti-semitism and some sexism in there. And keep in mind she was first harassed on her own videos which have since been taken down, I don't know what was said there.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well said.</p>
<p>I honestly believe in this case its more of "why did a kids place hire this person" rather than "how many kids did she rape?!". I don't think she personally did anything, she just has the sort of theme that attracts these guys.</p>
<p>ps whoever wrote this comment...I'm dying lol:
i guess you want to atract a younger listening group of people, with a little sex and violence in yor music and videos, but hey, this is just some tastless shit you released and i doubt you gonna get succesful outside the USA!! but best of luck!!</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm curious why that user just deleted all of their posts. I was just looking through their post history before these comments were deleted, and almost all of their posts defend the establishment and the narratives of Obama and Hillary. This begs the question, why would they also so strongly defend this artist and disregard all of the blatant references to pedophilia? It seems very suspicious. Their username was something like 'allenlikesmovies'. </p></p>

        <p><p>Also, her response to someone asking for explanations on the the band's pedophilic imagery:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>answer your questions... number 1...Though-out the history of rock music bands (especially in the 70's/ 80's) have created album art to confuse, anger, create mystery, piss people off, or get a laugh for shits and giggles. (just google any metal album from then) I would say at the time it was created much indie music was very mild, polite, very serious music (not very rockin), etc both in sound and image. We as a band were more interested in creating overtly sexual, violent, yet goofy images but keeping it somewhat abstract by collaging 70's 80's horror/ porn/ movie stills with the creeper aspects of the internet age. In horror movies of the past, breathing heavy into the phone was a staple in every slasher film thus with that vibe in mind Heavy Breathing was born. As for the picture.....The kid with a popsicle is taken directly from a 70's ad selling popsicles. Obviously it is creepy and weird... but funny someone would use it back then in an ad campaign... so it was used. I guess no one back in the 70's saw it as a dildo. Hope this answers your question. As for question 2. If you are considering playing a few shows as being "benefited'" and "associating" by the establishment then i suppose hundreds and hundreds of local and national acts who have played there are all part of a big association. That's how music venues work. bands play there. As for your trick question: Sex Stains was a punk band and much like bands from the past Sex Pistols, Circle Jerks Dead Kennedys, Butthole Surfers etc they have a name to get a reaction ....young people teens dig it. I quite sure you have been to an all ages punk show some time in your life. If not check one out. You just might have a good time.</p>

        <p><p><strong>Notice how that explanation does not mention child, children, or kids once.</strong></p>
<p>That speaks volumes because they can't justify it and so they use a straw man argument.</p>
<p>No one is questioning the above, they are questioning the use of <strong>CHILDREN IN</strong> <em>"creating overtly sexual, violent, yet goofy images but keeping it somewhat abstract by collaging 70's 80's horror/ porn/ movie stills with the creeper aspects of the internet age."</em></p></p>

        <p><p>Right and the only time they mention it is in reference to the kid with the popsicle being a part of a "creepy" but "funny" 70s ad.  So the way she describes it the band decided to use the image because they thought it was funny that the kid is basically holding a dildo. Her explanation makes no sense in light of the fact that they lifted that image of the kid  and put it into a drawing with <em>more</em> kids surrounding the popsicle kid with the words "all the children": https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/fr/cp0/e15/q65/15002445_198406947281870_1888807782361453495_o.jpg</p>
<p>if her explanation for their use of that pic were true, they wouldn't need to make it even creepier by putting drawings of more kids and creepy words around it. They took something supposedly "funny" and turned it into something blatantly pedophilic. </p></p>

        <p><p>Very probable, but in any case it was a very predictable PR-laden empty response. It doesn't get to the heart of the allegations or deny anything at all. It's the type of crazy-making, dismissive, deflective stuff that is very familiar to anyone who's ever intimately known a manipulator.</p></p>

<p>Still needs corrections. *Most people saw the popsicle in that child's hand as a popsicle. And those who saw it as a dildo, well, they didn't choose to publish that idea in restaurants around kids! So I was the first and I feel good about it. ~ Amanda "Love Little Lads" Kleinman</p></p>

        <p><p>they have been instructed. They have been told to flag up the racist card, the bigot card, the right wing card etc and add to the media mix in order to start a civil war.</p>
<p>They want to have a military controlled state.</p>
<p>Hillary has been campaigning for the state to own children since her education years at least.</p>
<p>This also means, because all these people are releasing statements that they have been talking with one another and coming up with a plan of action "deny and deflect"</p>
<p>This also means we will unlikely EVER see Clinton and co again on TV unless in handcuffs imho</p></p>

        <p><p>interesting how she responds around the relatively same time frame as James Alefantis' article from the washington paper, and uses somewhat similar rhetoric to paint people involved in a negative light (Alefantis and homophobia, Kleinman and hinting at antisemitism/sexism) and display themselves as victims.  </p>
<p>While it is certainly possible she is not involved, (I personally do not believe it), there is simply too much coincidence to simply pass everything off and not provide a meaningful explanation for the contents of her jokes/music/videos. </p></p>

        <p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>It's a pizza place that has hipster bands play at night. Kids aren't going to be there at night. Also, when rock posters say "All Ages", it means you don't have to be 21 to get in. Lots of teenagers want to go to rock shows but can't because of alcohol laws. All ages shows became popular right in DC in the 80s because of local bands like Fugazi championing the right of younger fans being able to attend their shows.</p></p>

<p>The <strong>"why the fuck would a kids place host an act like this".</strong> did not refer to a hipster band.</p>
<p>To put it more clearly <strong>why would a children friendly place host an act that simulated child abuse/porn?.</strong></p>
<p>It makes as much sense as a petting Zoo, hosting an act that simulates beastiality.</p>

        <p><p>Likewise, were I in a band like that and involved in some sort of pedophile ring I don't know that I'd go out of my way to associate myself publically with said group by playing a gig in their house. </p>
<p>Just feels like a bad idea if I was trying to remain hidden. </p>
<p>I think that's pretty strange. </p></p>

        <p><p>The problem is that people that are pedophiles are  not ashamed or think their behavior is strange. This leads to collecting articles and secret communication in a large sub culture to share these experiences, items or acts.</p>
<p>Think of a group of trekies that love meeting and sharing paraphernalia but need to keep shit secret. </p>
<p>So there is a risk benefit analysis involved. The bigger the network the more reward. The bigger the network needs more overt communication to grow and sustain.</p></p>

        <p><p>Not really......guh I don't even know what to think. I'm trying SO hard to give them the benefit of the doubt... </p>
<p>On one hand it is late at night and kids probably wouldn't attend. But it does say all ages and it seems like a bad move for business (clearly cause we are catching on) to be involved in a lot of things they are in considering how strongly they emphasize they are a kid friendly, family establishment. </p>
<p>Can they all just come out with their hands up so I can sleep at night? I haven't slept yet cause I'm going back and forth with all this info trying to make sense of it all and I think I'm going insane.</p></p>

        <p><p>What he said is straight up bullshit. No one is going to advertise "for all ages" and then put on an adult show and hope no kids show up. Such ridiculous logic. </p>
<p>I see party and gig flyers every day, and never once have I seen a flyer that said "all ages" but looked like it was a an adult sex party. Any flyer (in fact, I'm looking at one on a bulletin board right now) that says "all ages" actually LOOKS like it is for all ages. </p>
<p>If there was ever an event that was for older people but they didn't have to be 21, it would just say so. </p></p>

        <p><p>True. And they could still say ages 13+ or 18+ or something, I see it all the time with other events.</p>
<p>Also, they do have alcohol there, so given that it is probably good to have 21 only so people don't sneak anyone underage alcohol in the dark. From the videos I have seen it isn't very well lit. </p>
<p>I think the only times I ever have seen events for all ages that are after hours are things at nature centers for stargazing or bat watching. But again...I don't really get out much.</p>
<p>Aren't late night things more of a time to be kid free and relax? Sorta any way you look at it it doesn't really make sense except for <em>maybe</em> keeping the doors open to teenagers. But now that I really think about it even that doesn't make much sense. </p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. I'm trying to see things from every perspective and it is nice to have a discussion so we can figure out wtf is going on.</p></p>

<p>And yes, there are late night events for kids, I've had to take my cousins to a few of them, and they are always stuff like star gazing, late night bowling, or fire works. Even then, it usually isn't at 10PM, the only time I've seen it that late is when they had some sleep over type event or if it was a New Years event. </p>
<p>It's good to look at every perspective. I found this place from /r/all. A lot of these posts and theories I do not agree with, at all. I think lots of people are jumping the gun.</p>
<p>But what that user was saying about posters and events is complete and total bullshit. I don't know if this Heavy Breathing band is involved in something shady or if they're just a dumbass hipster band that's trying to be "edgy",  but there is certainly a reason to question why a "family friendly" restaurant is hiring them and advertising their events in such a vulgar and gross way. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, way too much jumping the gun here and trying hard to connect dots. Hopefully the more people have discussions like you and I are having, the more we can get the truth.</p>
<p>This band seems like they are just trying to be edgy, but it is weird they joke about pedophilia several times, and abortion. Hell, I love Marylin Manson and I don't think I have ever heard him joke about pedophilia lol.</p>
<p>Not to say other 'more respectable' musicians haven't made jokes (Oingo Boingo, Danny Elfman's band and the creator of a majority of Tim Burton's music, has a song called Little Girls for instance), but I also don't see him caught up in a possible child sex trafficking case. It sorta just adds more fuel to the 'wtf is going on here and why are there SO many strange coincidences like this' fire.</p>
<p>Anyway, I doubt I'm even making sense at this point my brain is so dead.</p></p>

        <p><p>No, you're making perfect sense, it's how I feel too. Some bands I listen to are really vulgar and say really off the wall stuff, but that brings us back to the original concern, why the hell is a kid place hiring these kinds of bands?</p>
<p>As for her gross humor, I have had friends who made gross pedo jokes before. But you know what, they never said that shit in front of kids, so it really doesn't help her case any. That said, I do believe that this band is just trying to be edgy, My bigger concern is the restaurant who hired her and sees no problem in advertising her to kids.</p></p>

        <p><p>They are not a kids place per se, they are just "kid friendly". A designation many places now make for parents who may not want to bring their kids to a bar type place. Many places, especially places that serve liquor discourage parents from bringing kids in because they want the younger crowd. Comet appears to want to have it both ways (no pun intended). Too much is being made of this "it's a place for kids" thing. It's not like it's Chuck E. Cheese or some place like that. At night they shut down the ping pong room and it becomes a stage where hipster bands play, they have dance nights etc. Frankly, I don't believe any of the alleged activity occurs on site, unless it is after biz hours. There's just too many staff and patrons around. At least the times I've been in there. Also, all this stuff about secret doors is off base. The theory on that comes from their bathroom doors which kind of blend into the whole wall. They're not secret, they're just camo'd. </p></p>

        <p><p>I find it hilarious that you think toddlers are going to "show up" for a show in DC that starts at 10pm. If any kids are there that late, they're with their parents. Obviously. Kind of like how kids might be at R-rated movies full of sex and violence when accompanied by their parents.</p>
<p>What city do you live in? I'll happily find you "adult" flyers for all ages shows there, since you pretend never to have seen any.</p>
<p>Also hilarious: All the responses here from people who seem entirely clueless as to bars, music venues, shows, and pretty much everything having to do with going out.</p></p>

        <p><p>I live in a hipster heavy state. We have hipster pizza places that have all age rock shows regularly. There are kids at the all ages show here, always. The only difference is that the music is actually appropriate for all ages....because kids DO go.</p></p>

<p>Bullshit. No one is going to advertise "for all ages" and then put on an adult show and hope no kids show up. Such ridiculous logic. </p>
<p>I see party and gig flyers every day, and never once have I seen a flyer that said "all ages" but looked like it was a an adult sex party. Any flyer (in fact, I'm looking at one on a bulletin board right now) that says "all ages" actually LOOKS like it is for all ages. </p>
<p>If there was ever an event that was for older people but they didn't have to be 21, it would just say so. Just because you have been to an All Ages gig and saw no kids doesn't mean shit besides that kids didn't show up to the event. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, I have. <em>Lots of times</em>. Back when I was a teen, lots of metal and rock banks loved to use pentagrams and shit in their posters to be 'edgy', but never once did I see them use sexual or adult themes involving kids. If shows were aimed at older audiences, it would just say so. They wouldn't put on an adult themed show and then hope that no kids come by, even though they advertised it as kids welcomed, <em>because that is fucking stupid</em>. </p>
<p>I mean really think about that for a second, you're having an adult themed show and you don't want kids there. So what happens when a kid does show up?  Just shrug and say "oh well"? Or would they tell the kid to leave, and when the parent asks why, respond with "Uhh well I know the poster <em>said</em> it was for kids, but it really isn't." I don't know why you're trying to convince people otherwise, it's such dumb reasoning and definitely a lie.</p></p>

        <p><p>I've been to a shitload of "all ages" shows that had adult themes. When I was like 14-18 I saw the Cramps play several times at "all ages" shows, got wine spit on me by Lux Interior and all. Not to mention the countless other shows. All ages shows are most definitely geared for teenagers. </p>
<p>Look, there is some real evidence for this shit, but to harp on things like this simply isn't going to go anywhere. As someone whose played in a few bands...you book shows, you play them. You don't give a shit what the venue is doing, you concentrate on your set and getting your shit set up right. If there's actual evidence of these people being involved in something, other than some song lyrics, then I'd be all for it. But this is a pretty weak set of "evidence". You have to understand, in the art world, people do weird shit. Whether its strange art pieces, film, photos, songs or lyrics, poems, etc. None of those things are actual evidence of anything real, it's art. Now, if someone WAS abused for that "art", then that's one thing. But to call the art itself into question simply because it's strange and doesn't fit into what most people would do, well then that's not a very good basis for an argument...because most people aren't artists.</p></p>

        <p><p>You're changing goal posts. What you're asking now is easy to find in this sub. </p>
<p>You can't come up with a logical answer for these main concerns:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The posters themselves are sexualized and have adult themes. This, in of itself, is not the issue; hell, I have seen swingers posters in my area. Sex themes and adult gigs are not what bothers people about these posters. The issue people have is that some of these sexualized posters have children in them. Why do they advertise this way? Even if they made it clear that the event was for older people, the question still remains, <em>why are they using children in sexualized posters</em>? Not even the most edgy, Hot Topic rejected bands do that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not only are the posters themselves concerning on their own, but what they are advertising is as well. Some of the bands have adult lyrics, use creepy and sexualized imagery in their sets or songs, and they say or do things that are not appropriate for kids. Adult themed bands are not automatically bad. Plenty of the bands I like would be rated R for sure. But the question is, why is a "family friendly" restaurant hiring and promoting these bands, and claiming that they are safe for "all ages"? Put it this way, would these bands be something a local school would hire? Would a local park or fair hire these bands? Hell no they wouldn't.  </p>
</li>
</ol></p>

        <p><p>I think that a lot of people have gotten hung up on the seeming contradictory family friendly vibe of the restaurant and more adult driven nature of their live musical performances. Most of the shows start at 10pm or later, and just because a show is all ages doesn't mean that their are kids younger than 14 there. I spent a lot of time at an all ages venue (gasp, it was also a pizza shop!) between the ages of 17 and 21. I didn't see anyone get raped there.</p></p>

        <p><p>I haven't seen any of those pictures referencing camp outs, source?</p>
<p>I saw a gal at a bar last week with a baby, at 10:15. Curious? Sure. There are a lot of dummies out there. Taking a kid to an all ages venue for a late show is potentially irresponsible, but not proof that anything untoward is happening.</p>
<p>I know the response is that looking at it through the context of all the other "evidence" shows a more sinister theme than any one image, but a lot of that "evidence" is also seen, by the pizzagaters, in he context that your hypothesis has already been proven. </p>
<p>It's the unquestioned assumption that child molestation is happening at this establishment that lends a dubious amount of credence to the wild leaps of logic.</p></p>

        <p><p>Can't seem to find the camping pic.  The kids are roasting marshmellows.   They look (without exception) either depressed as fuck or drugged up.   </p>
<p>I wonder: Do you think it's appropriate to have a picture of a guy <a href="https://i.sli.mg/lu0Uf9.png">ejaculating</a> with the words "Shut up N Fuck" in a place overflowing with little kids?   </p></p>

        <p><p>Do I think it's appropriate? No. Do I think that the owners of the establishment intended it to be on the wall? No. The owner isn't necessarily responsible for graffiti in their bathroom.</p></p>

        <p><p>1) Wow, you speak with such confidence while being so wrong. Shut up n fuck is grafitti, the white writing and drawing is grafitti. The actual art is a typical painted mural of a guy playing ping pong.</p>
<p>2) As far as I know, they kept it on the wall just long enough to post the picture. Do you have any reason to believe they didn't immediately wash it off?</p>
<p>Also, my guess is that's the bathroom, which always has vulgar grafitti in EVERY bar and club I've ever been to.</p></p>

        <p><p>Do you really want to plunge our country into a new dark age where artists and musicians have to monitor what they say in the context of music so that they don't fall under the scrutiny of a witch hunt? Do artists really need to now get conspiracy theorists' to vet their lyrics?</p>
<p>Better start off by banning The Doors' "The End" where Morrison talks about killing his father and fucking his mother. Because certainly, that was a clue that Jim Morrison was actually a rapist and murderer, right?</p></p>

        <p><p>No obviously i dont but giving the context that she was called out on, as in catering to child molesters, and having said stuff like that which obviously alludes to some form of child abuse, it would have been wise on her part to explain what she meant when saying that stuff instead of just calling everyone a conspiracy theorist. </p></p>

        <p><p>She actually did if you look through the comments. It was something about how music is often made to be controversial and create a reaction in people, which is very true.</p>
<p>She did call people out before she explained that, but to be fair she was also being ridiculed by people and under stress it is hard to keep a level head. Especially if you are being accused of pedophilia.</p></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Trigger them you mean. The phrase: if you play with fire you might get your hands burnt is a good analogy.</p>
<p>If a Pizza place that had a lovely hobby farm out the back booked me to play some gig with my Band and that created "ART" about pooch fucking, donkey dicking, i 'might' think it was kind of cool.</p>
<p>Now if that same Pizza place was connected to a beastiality ring then i would think, Fuck, </p>
<p>1) Maybe I shouldn't play the Victim
2) Maybe people don't like 'ART' that depicts cruelty or degrading treat to vulnerable beings. 
3) I got to stop fucking chickens.</p>
<p>Number 3 is my "ART"y joke. But you get what I mean</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She did call people out before she explained that, but to be fair she was also being ridiculed by people and under stress it is hard to keep a level head. Especially if you are being accused of pedophilia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So its impossible to keep a level head when being accused of pedophilia because its such a awful crime. But it's okay to do ART about it because you want to break new ground?</p>
<p>Again play with fire and you can't be shocked that you get burnt.</p></p>

Oh and a 2 year acct with a cool relevant username. In any case whatever their motives it's clear that at the very least they have their own inclinations with this type of "art"</p></p>

        <p><p>Dark age? Oh please.</p>
<p>Artist have always had monitor what they say and do. It's called living in a society. No not a secret society, the real kind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Better start off by banning The Doors' "The End" where Morrison talks about killing his father and fucking his mother.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adults fucking and killing adults is nothing outrageous. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because certainly, that was a clue that Jim Morrison was actually a rapist and murderer, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, it was a clue he was influenced by Freud. </p>
<p>While we are on Freud he did back away he did great damage to victims of child abuse. Rather than stick to his original theory that sexual abuse as a child leads to mental health problem as an adult and this abuse was not un common at the time . He changed his theory that it was all in the child's head and part of 'seduction'  by the child. All because he was ridiculed as a crackpot (conspiracy theorist). </p></p>

        <p><p>Did Freud really change his position on child sexual abuse based on public ridicule?  That sounds like a fascinating and disturbing thing that I would like to read more about.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes. He presented his work to colleagues in Vienna and he meet derision and anger. He then wrote an "Opps my bad, the little tempters are imagining it as part of their infantile sexuality"</p>
<p>There was also some talk of him being abused by his nanny. And coincidently his grandson (a pedophile) was mentioned as meeting Madeline McCanns parents. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Freud's seduction theory (German: Verführungstheorie) was a hypothesis posited in the mid-1890s by Sigmund Freud that he believed provided the solution to the problem of the origins of hysteria and obsessional neurosis. According to the theory, a repressed memory of an early childhood sexual abuse or molestation experience was the essential precondition for hysterical or obsessional symptoms, with the addition of an active sexual experience up to the age of eight for the latter.[1]</p>
<p>In the traditional account of development of seduction theory, Freud initially thought that his patients were relating more or less factual stories of sexual mistreatment, and that the sexual abuse was responsible for many of his patients' neuroses and other mental health problems.[2] Within a few years Freud abandoned his theory, concluding that the memories of sexual abuse were in fact imaginary fantasies.[3]</p>

        <p><p>If he'd been greater because society had been less messed up, he wouldn't have been suicided either.</p>
<p>Even after all the things he got wrong, he's generally considered to have been one of those smart people humanity could use more of.  Sad to think about all the potential that gets wasted by the foibles of every era.  Getting pretty off-topic though.</p></p>

        <p><p>The first thing to do when it comes to Biljana Đurđević is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Biljana+%C4%90ur%C4%91evi%C4%87&amp;tbm=isch">a Google Images search</a>.  That's the kind of art that person does.  It's protected expression, and hopefully it's all above-board.</p>
<p>Here's some info on the potential for the use of art as a store of value to faciliating human trafficking.  Again, hopefully this is all bollocks:  http://investmentwatchblog.com/1031-exchange-how-art-can-be-used-to-pay-for-human-trafficking/</p>
<p>Alright, now onto Marina Abramovic.  I called her Mabrams because I hate her first name, which is petty and I know it.  Heh.  Bilge-Anna has a pretty terrible name too, but I can't think of a witty way to improve on what it already is.</p>
<p>Info on her spiritual beliefs has gotten ironically harder to find lately with all the people freaking out about it, because freakouts don't exactly use the same lingo as true believers.  The search pages are slammed with poorly informed people worrying about satanism and gaslighting partisans running smear campaigns against the people worrying about satanism.  Nevertheless, she has made public statements reinforcing the perception that her art has occult attachments.  Check this article out to see her claiming we could all learn telepathy if we weren't connected by technology:  http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/30/arts/marina-abramovic-method-sydney/  </p>
<p>Here's another one of interest:  http://aristocratsofthesoul.com/occult-world-of-marina-abramovic/</p>
<p>Just like with Biljana, this is protected expression under the first amendment, and we can hope it's all sincere/harmless/creative.  Unlike with Biljana, there's still an edge of inherent scandal if it's all aboveboard, because Mabrams works with the elite who typically profess to be Christian (for PR reasons, presumably).</p></p>

<p>That said, I seriously doubt that Podesta and his ilk even know who these hipsters are. </p>

        <p><p>You know, this 'response' has 'CTR' written all over it.</p>
<p>It's all a vast right-wing conspiracy, they tried to do the same to AC/DC, it's 100% false, John Podesta is not part of a pedo ring (how do they know that?).</p>
<p>How about they explain why Soros &amp; co are pumping tens of thousands of dollars into a ping pong cafe with pedophilic logos and masonic imagery on the walls, on a street full of weird shit like this?</p></p>

        <p><p>The lone wolves attempting to argue on her turf are damaging our potential strength as we gather more evidence. I wish they would stop, and ignore her/anyone's responses on their own turf where they will be backed up by each other until the mountain of evidence is too high for then to say or do anything. Debating amongst them is a losing battle and discrediting the info we have when people slip pockets of their own theories into what already appears to others as flimsy evidence </p></p>

        <p><p>Agreed, when talking to anyone skeptical it's best to keep it short and challenge them to come to their own conclusions.   The evidence is undeniable and the connections are overwhelming, any naysayers should be implored to come to their own conclusions and not take our word for it.</p></p>

        <p><p>Their entire friends' list were calling the lone wolf types crazy. Plus I saw a coulle mentioning illuminati/shadow government as a debate point to people on facebook. Realize that we've (as in, regular society) have learned to completely discredit certain phrases and everything that follows afterwards.</p></p>

        <p><p>Or, you know, it's a beloved local establishment and people are defending it from baseless accusations and showing their support since a bunch of harassing calls and false Wikipedia edits have been pouring in lately. But, no, it's probably people being paid to do it, just like the protestors. </p></p>

        <p><p>i like the fact that that so many new dropins here today. you do not discourage us - you embolden us. you do not fracture us - the calling us misguided and crazy only refines us and unifies us. In what I've read I'm confident to say we are people of all backgrounds, genders, orientations, faiths, races, etc. their comments have no teeth and we are doing good work. Keep it up. Keep digging. </p>
<p>the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didnt exist.</p>
<p>i encourage you would be backers of majestic ape to keep talking while we add almost a thousand people a day. i am seeing all sorts of languages on twitter hashtagging #pizzagate. this is spreading not diminishing. It is cute almost that both the MA fb reply and the James Alefantis bites in the article use the same tired defense of this is - racist, homophobic, xenophobic etc, etc. I would have expected better of them honestly. And I think it's proof that we're doing MUCH better than we even thought. We are doing good work. Plenty have commented about Alefantis' words, but I want to say I found the MA comments odd too - where she says there's no pedo ring...'that she knows of.' lol. how many of us would bother to put that in there. it's like a brushback pitch, but that's all. I would have expected more. </p>
<p>so try the misinformation and let the rest of us get back to the good and needful and valid work.</p></p>

<p>Edit to clarify: majestic ape is at the point in an interrogation where the suspect starts to distance themselves but not other suspects.  Next she will start saying she doesn't know anything about what OTHER people are doing. Then, suddenly she will know small details. Small details turn into larger details. This is criminal psychology 101</p></p>

        <p><p>New to this conspiracy watched some videos about instagram posts that included some bands that i know personally and professionally. as a muscian, you don't always know what venue you are going to be playing at or the back story of that venue. I hate to see hardworking touring muscians like Colleen Green to name one of them. ( in a youtube video this young female muscian was refered to as a possible pedo pupateer?) As for the all ages part, every show that i have been too has almost always been all ages, that includes bar gigs! Muscians are just hardworking people who will play a gig if it means they can make money to get to there next gig. Don't slander them Just bc they played at this hell hole. Cuz i can gurantee the bands that play there have no clue of such things and if they did they would NOT play there.</p></p>

        <p><p>Hey what's up with the other mod ?DumbScribblyUnctious He is quite obviously working hand in hand with depressedexplorer. Explorer shills the thread hard and then mod comes and hides or closed good threads based on depressedexplorers comments. Can someone take his mod privileges?  He has done this on several good threads. Reasoning? "This is fucking stupid"</p></p>

        <p><p>Oh yeah, for sure. The best thing to do would be to go silent on them. They are such a minor part of the puzzle if at all, and if they really ARE a part of the picture, they will hire shills to attack them and make everyone in pizzagate look bad.</p></p>

        <p><p>One of the songs music videos shows 2 houses that are a few homes away from each other, like Besta and PingPong being a few buildings away, one is the place where the girl is, and the other is where the guy is, in the song while they are messaging each other, it says "eww gross are you a pedophile?". Take note that these buildings are suspected to have boys and girls separately. Next clip shows them hanging out. Its heavily subliminal. Her being Jewish adds to this, and she uses her liberalism to make her look like a target.</p></p>

        <p><p>I actually believe she's not really "in" on it. With the names involved, there's no way they'd let some edgy twentysomething know the real secrets. She's got the artist sensibility and enjoys being provocative.</p>
<p>The real evil people enjoy watching her performances as a wink wink.</p></p>
