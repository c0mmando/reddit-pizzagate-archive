<strong>[Tutorial] Get Any PizzaGate Related Content You Want To Share On 100+ Legacy News Sites</strong>
<p><p>1) Create a PROFESSIONAL press release (or pay $5 for someone to do it for you)</p>
<p>2) Submit the release to prbuzz or any other distribution network. </p>
<p>3) Hundreds of legacy news sites will automatically post the press releases.</p>
<p>4) Reporters often check press releases for interesting news, if your release is good they might write a story about it.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Easiest way to get this all done is to go on Fiverr.com and pay $5 for someone in India to write and distribute the press release for you. </p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p>https://www.fiverr.com/seospecialist2/write-a-press-release-and-submit-it-to-top-25-high-pr-distribution-network?context=advanced_search&amp;context_type=rating&amp;context_referrer=search_gigs&amp;pckg_id=1&amp;pos=2&amp;funnel=849b08a6-885b-4670-b137-3702d536db97</p>
<p>^ There maybe better sellers so shop around for the best.</p>
<p>Also their are people on fiverr that sell posts to sites like huffington post, and many other news sites. </p>
<p>If someone wants to drop some cash to spread awareness this is an easy way. </p>
<p>Also, shitloads of other gigs on fiverr to get tons of eyeballs. Buy a 50,000 link forum spam, or blog spam package and just blast the fuck out of the entire internet with pizzagate. There are loads of ways to benefit from Fiverr. And it's dirt cheap.</p>
<p>PS - obviously I don't profit off any of this, just a quick disclaimer. </p>
<p>GL! Back to work for me.</p></p>
