<strong>Roberta's, Isa Restaurant, Cocktail Magic, &amp; Well Dunn Foundation</strong>
<p><p><strong>Roberta's</strong> <a href="http://archive.is/Y3uNw">posts</a> some wild stuff (http://archive.is/UdRFQ). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Roberta’s Pizza was established in the heart of Bushwick, Brooklyn in January 2008, and has since become a neighborhood institution, a culinary destination, and an incubator for progressive entrepreneurship. It is now home to a rooftop greenhouse, an artisanal bread bakery, and its first Manhattan brick &amp; mortar operation inside the UrbanSpace Vanderbilt Market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their latest party is <strong><a href="http://archive.is/OqRWL">Cocktail Magic</a> "A Celebration Of Cocktails &amp; Illusions"</strong>. Creepy video link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZC37rDlrs8 Notice <a href="http://archive.is/amwEq">"a portion of ticket sales will go to the <strong>Well Dunn Foundation</strong>"</a></p>
<p>New York Event (http://archive.is/amwEq) <em>"Cocktails of the highest quality are served in an unpretentious, dark and sexy room accompanied by occasionally raucous rock 'n roll belters."</em>
Boston Event (http://archive.is/DRL2c) <em>"Chef Michael Scelfo’s Alden &amp; Harlow is located at 40 Brattle Street in Cambridge and serves thoughtfully sourced, honest American food in a subterranean modern and comfortable space. Vegetables play a strong role in dishes throughout the menu, balanced by the popularity of the restaurant’s “Secret Burger,” an evolving sought after special that is announced through social media channels. The cocktail program at Alden &amp; Harlow is market-driven, reflecting the restaurant’s overall philosophy. In 2014, Alden &amp; Harlow was awarded “Best New Restaurant” by both Boston Magazine and the Improper Bostonian, in addition to being recognized by Bon Appetit as one of the “Top 50 Best New Restaurants” in the country. The Boston Globe’s dining critic Devra First awarded the restaurant three-stars. In addition, CNN Eatocracy titled their “Secret Burger” one of the “Best Burgers in the US”"</em></p>
<p>Someone posted a <a href="http://archive.is/AC4FA">link</a> to Roberta's and I noticed a logo (http://archive.is/3AoQQ) in the corner so I investigated. Come to find out, it is from <strong>Isa Restaurant</strong> (http://archive.is/Q4sIw). They have posted some peculiar things. Here are a couple examples; nothing too mindblowing. You can still go through their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/isawythe/?hl=en">Instagram</a> </p>
