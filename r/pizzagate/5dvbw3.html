    When I search, almost every link that comes up is related to this actual scandal. However, the ones from major websites talk about it as "the latest conspiracy theory." At least it's being talked about, I suppose.

       that doesnt help with anything all the normies are using google. They will see it mixed in a bunch of pointless shit and have to look for it instead of realising how big it is and just dismiss it off as tinfoil hat craziness. They are trying to stop this from growing

    Looking too much into it. The original usage of pizzagate was when a soccer player threw a slice of pizza at the opponent team's manager. It's not a cover up per se, people have been using 'pizzagate' to refer to other things for years prior to this.

    I think this is three things hapoening at once.
   </p>
   <p>
    1) Pizza companies trying to captialize rather than suffer from such a strong negative association.
   </p>
   <p>
    2) Total collusion by the media to cover this story up since they are to many degrees implicated in the coverup.
   </p>
   <p>
    3) Absolute proof that the beast is wounded and that we now have awareness of their weakness as well as our power. The children will unite us and untie their lascivious, pedocratic tyranny for many ages to come and God willing, forever.

     Or 4) there is tons of online content left over from multiple other "pizzagate" events in the past and there actually aren't that many people delusional enough to care about this particular pizzagate for it to have much content or traction throughout the greater internet.

    Pizzagate was a quick internal name that just bubbled up in the first days this was coming together when they're were only a few people on a couple of posts and no one had time to think about where it would all go
   </p>
   <p>
    The name stuck but that doesn't mean it can't be changed. .. or added to.  Pick something, tell everyone and pass the word.
   </p>
   <p>
    Pedopizzagate
   </p>
   <p>
    Pizzapedogate
   </p>
   <p>
    Something that distinguishes it and includes the term the speaks to the seriousness of what this is about.
   </p>
   <p>
    Maybe something even more pointed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Pedophiliagate
   </p>
   <p>
    Or maybe it makes sense to be nimble like the nimblest pedes always are and don't keep the same name.  Change it every week or two and they won't be able to drown it out.  By the time they try to drown one name we are already using another.

     This was the original "pizzagate" from a while back. Not related to this pizzagate, but earlier.

       Because people are digging it up again by googling the word. A lot of people who search probably end up checking that article too, just out of curiosity.

     Yeah, this happened and wasn't termed pizza gate until like 2007-8, despite happening in 2004. It became pizzagate after someone released an autobiography and it was confirmed that Cesc Fabregas had been the one who threw food at SAF and it was none other than a pizza.

   <p>
    Why do you think that?
   </p>
   <p>
    What is the motive of 'the MSM'? Do you seriously suppose there are
    <em>
     no journalists
    </em>
    - print, TV, radio, online - who wouldn't charge into the possibility of an actual paedophile conspiracy centering on Washington figures? Not a single journalist who wouldn't see this as an outstanding opportunity to further his or her career - even if it meant leaving their employer and taking the story to another employer, or just breaking it on the internet and waiting for the job offers to roll in?
   </p>
   <p>
    That there are no media owners who would give their eye-teeth to fuck up the Democratic party by revealing atrociously criminal behaviour by senior members of the party?
   </p>
   <p>
    Don't you ever have a moment where you think: 'Actually, this is all outlandishly improbable, I ought to be looking for crisp, unambiguous, coherent evidence and not what-ifs and maybes and posters
    <em>
     claiming
    </em>
    to be FBI agents who could equally well be
    <em>
     literally any other thing
    </em>
    ...'

     Go ahead and tell me that long list of media owner....go ahead. Once you discover that all MSM is owned by less than 5 people that all know and communicate with each other. There are no real investigative journalists anymore or none with a big enough pedestal from which to shout

      You're an idiot, and you're the worst kind of idiot, an uninformed one.

      Who owns CBS? Quick now, which of your 5 people is it?
     </p>
     <p>
      Which TV broadcaster with a news division is owned by Cumulus Media plc? Which of your 5 people owns Cumulus? Come on, get a move on - what's the answer? The certainty in your post is inconsistent with not having these things at your fingertips....
     </p>
     <p>
      OK, here's another - Comcast. Which broadcast news company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Comcast? And which of your 5 guys owns Comcast?

     The ONLY journalist who I can think of who would touch it is Lee Camp with "Redacted Tonight" from RT and he is actually a comedian. There might be two or three others.

      You're mistaken.
     </p>
     <p>
      At least, you're mistaken if we postulate that there was a real story here to investigate. If there was, journalists would be queuing up. If you could write or broadcast a story on the pizzagate elements, that's  Pulitzer right there.
     </p>
     <p>
      The reason why they don't touch it is not because it's dangerous, it's because journalists know how to sniff a story and weigh evidence. And that process tells them that pizzagate is as real as Frankenstein's monster, and twice as dead.

     That's how I see it. The fact that so many non related stories are being called pizzagate by MSM definitely stinks of a cover up attempt

     this guy , david seaman, was kicked off huffpo as a writer because he was delving into hillary's health prior to the election. he has been a guest on almost every major news show. has gone out on a limb before with stories about bitcoin and others. proves he is willing to do the same on this.

    Or perhaps adding "gate" to something is a dumb thing to do if you want it to be easily found, since adding "gate" is a dumb thing people do all over for stupid reasons?

    Either that or you find articles warning you of 'fake news'. Also, if you start to type 'pizzagate' into Google News, no suggestions come up.
