        <p><p>What are these pictures based on?  Isn't it an eyewitness account at night?  That's the part that confuses me, I have a hard time believing someone could recall that much detail from a single encounter.  Then again, I'm terrible with faces, and some people are photographic memory.  IDK </p></p>

        <p><p>You know, that's a very reasonable thought. It is incredible, given the level of detail that went into these sketches, that they were created based on witness descriptions. </p>
<p>I am inclined to suspect that they are part of an internal leak in the UK or Portugal, individuals who know it was the Podestas and are trying to let the world know. But I can't prove this, it is just speculation, which is why I haven't mentioned it until now. It seems like they know it was the Podestas, and created the sketches to match images they have of the Podestas. Then later said it was based on witness description to manufacture a trail of evidence. </p>
<p>Anyway, the official story is that the sketches were based on witness testimony, and they were suppressed for five years. </p></p>

        <p><p>Probably from Portuguese police who were angry the investigation was shut down.</p>
<p>The investigators said they knew who the abductors were.</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree. It doesn't make sense to me. They got the skin tone correct, the mole, face shapes, and now the indentation on his nose?? Seems too good to be true. I just don't understand it, especially if these images were created years ago. I also don't get how they are of the same person, they look so different. But all sources talking about the images describe 'efitS' but only one man. What? </p></p>

        <p><p>I've felt the same thing as well -- specifically because Tony's mole is on the wrong side.  Who gets that level of detail right, but on the WRONG side of the face??  But from a mirror selfie?!  Yes. </p></p>

        <p><p>I guess I really need to get up to speed on the madeline mccann backstory.  It wasn't one of the ones I followed in the news.  That idea seems to make sense.  Where did you get the 5 year number from?  Are they recently released?  Also, I've been seeing headlines about how they "can't arrest the people involved", has there been any increased information on that?  </p></p>

        <p><p>So, those defects are in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9OukW44mOw">original reporting</a>...</p>

<p>It does look like they shopped the eyes, and rotated the other picture.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes I do believe it is parallel construction. </p>
<p>Someone was trying to let the world know. </p>
<p>(My guess: NSA insider, as they would have had access to the phone locations in 2007, and the insider may have then leaked it to the Portuguese police who were frustrated that their investigation was being blocked.)</p>
<p>Here is a very interesting article on cell site analysis and the origin of the sketches. They -- the "burglars" (cough) -- were tracked by the use of their phones. https://www.thiscomplexworld.com/real-csi-cell-site-analysis/</p>
<p>Someone gave us an assist. We need to do our part and get this info out, keep hammering it out 24/7. </p>
<p>I strongly suspect our role is to increase the virility of all of this information, so that at the right time, the public will be prepped for... the big one.</p></p>

        <p><p>The problem with parallel construction is that it undermines everything.</p>
<p>If that's not a drawing from an eye witness, then it's a drawing from a (seemingly illegal) wiretap.</p>
<p>Would you want to change the law so everyone is monitored all the time... just to make sure you are not running a child swapping ring?</p>
<p>This is really more upsetting than anything else.  I'm almost inclined to say this is more fake news to make laws.</p>
<p>Maybe there is a white knight shopping images for the greater good (I'm sure there is), but that's probably not the way.  This could create more problems than it solves.</p></p>

        <p><p>Also, there's a drawing that's a close match for A.W.</p>
<p>Have you looked at that?  Could be A.W. got caught, and he leaked these photos to the journalist.</p></p>

        <p><p>Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't get the fascination with these pictures. There were not two suspects, those are two renderings based on the description of ONE suspect. The Irish couple saw ONE man carrying a kid -- and they said he was in his 30s. There wasn't a pair of 60 year old guys who bore a remarkable resemblance to the Podesta brothers.</p></p>

        <p><p>Okay guys you do know that police sketches are HIGHLY inaccurate. I'm new to this but is there any proof they were even in Portugal? Also why the hell would they abduct a child? Why not have someone do it for them?</p></p>
