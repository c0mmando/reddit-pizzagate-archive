    List of victims who have spoken out against against abuse by high ranking public figures?

    I was wondering if we could compile a list of victims who have spoken out against sexual abuse commited by high ranking figures.
   </p>
   <p>
    I've seen plenty of posts about this but I've hardly ever looked into it more. Maybe if we create a list with sources this will be easier to research

    I was just looking this up this Morning. I now believe they are all telling the truth too. There will be a long list I am sure. Lots of them mind control Victims would be a good start too.
