        <strong>Morale and Encouragement</strong>
        <p><p>Here are lyrics from a song called "The Numbers" by Radiohead.  I think it can be helpful to connect with art especially when it comes from someone as well-respected as Radiohead.  Thom has always seemed to have a good grasp of these types of situations.  I just thought you guys would like the encouragement from Radiohead :)</p>
<p>It holds us like a phantom</p>
<p>The touch is like a breeze</p>
<p>It shines its understanding</p>
<p>See the moon smiling</p>
<p>Open on all channels</p>
<p>Ready to receive</p>
<p>And we're not at the mercy</p>
<p>Of your shimmers or spells</p>
<p>Your shimmers or spells</p>
<p>We are of the earth</p>
<p>To her we do return</p>
<p>The future is inside us</p>
<p>It's not somewhere else</p>
<p>It's not somewhere else</p>
<p>It's not somewhere else</p>
<p>One day at a time</p>
<p>We call upon the people</p>
<p>People have this power</p>
<p>The numbers don't decide</p>
<p>Your system is a lie</p>
<p>The river running dry</p>
<p>The wings of a butterfly</p>
<p>And you may pour us away like soup</p>
<p>Like we're pretty broken flowers</p>
<p>We'll take back what is ours</p>
<p>Take back what is ours</p>
<p>One day at a time</p>
<p>Also, the lyrics from Idioteque and 2+2=5 are relevant to this whole situation.  </p></p>
