        <strong>Has anyone looked into Alex Huston?</strong>
        <p><p>https://youtu.be/AJf0D4NCyq0  </p>
<p>The link provided is a Mark Phillips/Cathy O'brien talk.  In the 50:00-52:00 mark he talks about his Business parter alex houston.  A Chinese intelligence agent tells him he has to get rid of his partner, and proceeds to tell him that he is a pedophile and shows Mark different photos including one of Alex having sex with Haitian child.</p>
<p>Edit: all the things he showed Mark were classifies documents. </p>
<p>We should really do an AMA with someone who is in the know and is an activist on our side.  </p></p>

        <p><p>yeah I agree. Old MK stuff is on paper- they didn't get to scrub it over and over. There is potential for leads that stretch back through the decades. When people say pizzagate can't be real I assume they don't really understand the extent of MK Ultra. It can happen. It has before. </p></p>
