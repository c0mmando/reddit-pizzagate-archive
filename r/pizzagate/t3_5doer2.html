        <strong>Turkey legalising rape and pedophilia</strong>
        <p><p>http://awdnews.com/top-news/turkey%E2%80%99s-constitutional-court-stirs-outrage-by-legalizing-pedophilia</p>
<p>http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38030182</p>
<p>The new law is not only letting the rapists free but also gives them a chance to marry the victim! There are at least 3000 rapists and pedophiles expected to be released. I saw people defending it, calling it "sunna" (it may be google translate's fault that i get it this way). There was also the scandals about the Erdogan's son's ENSAR foundation, more than 45 kid and 10 woman are raped and rapists were protected for a long time. The more I searched about Turkey, the more I found these kind of scandalous acts. </p>
<p>Why are they legalising it? Are they aiming to reduce the number of prisoners? Are they afraid of a blackmail or a scandal they're going to get? Are they aiming a pedo-tourism ring? If Turkish people on this reddit could enlighten me i'd appreciate that.</p>
<p>I guess the crescent moon and star in the Comet Ping Pong logo are kinda suited now (like symbolizing a safe haven for the pedophiles).</p></p>

        <p><p>My mother warned me to NEVER visit Saudi Arabia, and that was decades ago. She told me that women have NO rights there, even women from other countries. I think I can speak for 'the left' as well an anyone, so no, that is not what the left is saying. </p></p>

        <p><p>What does this have to do with pizzagate? It's not being covered up globally, nor is it a scandal. People have been talking about child marriage and pedophilia in Islamic countries for a long time in the mainstream.</p></p>
