        <p><p>I looked but didn't see this posted. Sorry if I missed it. 
2015 - Lanny Davis trying to get ahold of John Podesta re "email issue".  </p>
<p>"Thanks. Wouldn't bother you unless I thought this is important. Cell number above best. Office (Maddie) always can find me"</p>
<p>Is Maddie his administrative assistant?</p>
<p>Or is that name mentioned to let him know the urgency at hand? </p>
<p><strong><em>edit for update</em></strong>. Someone in another thread  confirmed that he did have an assistant named Madeleine.   (Madeleine Menendez). He referred to her as Maddie. </p>
<p>I deleted that one but will leave this up so that others can see that the question has already been answered.  </p></p>
