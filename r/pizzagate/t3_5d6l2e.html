<strong>Response to Alefantis and call for diggers prove before accusing.</strong>
<p><p>James Alefantis,</p>
<p>The reason your restaurant is under a pretty heavy microscope is primarily due to your connections with the backroom leadership of the Democratic Party, of which many are some of the most powerful people in the world. John and Tony Podesta were the initial questionable figures, while Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein were the proven deviants. Sorry for your luck, but two of the most famous deviants in government are a very close 2 degrees of separation from you. The reality is, just based on those connections, you have probably been under the microscope for years, but by smaller and much more discreet groups of people. </p>
<p>In the leaked Podesta emails, there are some very questionable references to pizza, pasta and a few other choices that progressively gained interest due to the repetitiveness and phrasing. Reading "Pizza related map" makes the average person investigating pay to play allegations shudder. Tony Podesta's art is a bit too much for me, and I can't help but think that having those pieces around depicting children in underwear while in compromised positions starts the dig into expanding the Clinton/Epstein connection, when the questions relating to Pizza and Pasta hit peak, the David Brock -&gt; You -&gt; Comet Ping Pong connection is made. </p>
<p>Enter Comet Ping Pong. Hipsters are pretty damn weird, and some of the posts on your Instagram are a little off putting when looked at in the context of trying to expose a global pedophile ring. One or two of the people that commented on them have interesting positions and ties that make them even more impactful if they were involved in any pedo related activities. </p>
<p>This is the point where everything flooded and somehow your place became the focal point. There are so many here that see a picture of anyone under 18 and immediately assume that you and your friends are trading them. </p>
<p>This is where everything started getting much bigger, which is good because it increases the reach, and I just hope it starts moving toward Epstein or the Panama papers. Such a mass of people have a much better chance of stumbling on something that could do a lot of good. </p>
<p>It's also where things started getting nasty, especially for you. First, experience in having gay friends has shown that those social groups tend to have a thinner barrier between family friendly and naked dude with pizza-dick-censorship. I've also made tongue in cheek jokes on some questionable subject matter. There are many here that turned everything they could into a post 'proving' that every picture on your Instagram was immediately before or after a pedo orgy, and a picture that someone probably forwarded you because you own a pizza place is now enough evidence to take to any judge and have you locked up for life. Like I said, the public face of this went to shit. </p>
<p>Some of your music friends are fucking weird. Majestic Ape was used a evidence, but I've been making fun of millennials long enough to know that they think they are artsy, and it isn't art unless it's shock value. I watched a video of about 40 of them absorbed into some stupid performance art where a girl makes spaghetti-Os. It's all pretentious garbage. You have a lot of it around your place. Some have come to think of every bit of it as concrete proof that you are currently in swimming in minors that were brought over for everyone's enjoyment. </p>
<p>The reason all the other places around you were being researched is because every one is owned by someone with a very close connection to the Clinton's. The logo for Besta is legitimately a pedo logo. I can't prove that it was intentional or even known, and would have like to have looked into it more, but 100 people called them pedophiles on the internet and that killed any chance to find something if there was something to find. The exposure pretty much killed any chance to find anything within 10 miles of you. </p>
<p>That being said, I may be the only one actively contributing that doesn't think you are involved. However, I do believe there are people you are very close to that may be involved in something unusual. The combination of leaks is really one of the first times that the average citizen had any real insight into how the most powerful people on earth communicate and govern. It also is a major dump of information, and the general consensus is that we all believe that there are some sick pedophiles in the middle of the power structure. I think we were close before we were blown up by idiots that think they are helping. We also expected Mark Wiener's Hard Drive to get dumped. There were a lot of trafficking arrests right around that time they got his hard drive, and everyone expected a surprise to drop right before Super Tuesday. This also made people believe there were files that could cripple DC. Those files probably do exist, but whether or not they are next to Mark's Wiener and it'proof of operation or will ever see the light of day is a mystery. </p>
<p>We aren't racist. We aren't xenophobic. We are conspiracy theorists for sure, so tell John he better hurry the hell up with the UFO files! And we aren't homophobic. If your friends didn't constant accuse me of being things I am no, You might have had some more WH pizza parties. You don't know us, and hopefully I can make these people understand they really don't know you.  Most of us just see that there are pedophiles connected at the highest levels and if Jeffrey Epstein can get caught in a pedophile ring, trafficking minors to an island in a different country and having the world know he's a pedophile that somehow walks out of jail after 6 months..? Every couple years you hear about a DC pedo link or a Hollywood link. There is a sickness there. People disappear for researching these things by traditional routes, and I assume it can happen on the internet, but this type of unprofessional, amateur, committed mass of people might be the only way we can break through and uncover this 'known secret' and break a global pedophile human trafficking ring, I'm gonna dig in my spare time along with the group, and lend my hand. To me, Pedophiles are the most disgusting people on earth, and if they were a nation, we should destroy them. You probably dispise our collective method, but that's just what happened when there were too many cooks and not enough kitchen, plus I'm sure a few people here want to be heros. </p>
<p>Diggers,</p>
<p>There is a long way between a pizza place that looks sketchy and proof that they are pedophiles. It's okay to investigate, but do it silently and if you find something, make sure it already hasn't been exposed, then report it without emotion so people can find it later and don't have to navigate through your emotional rant about how sick this person or that person is. </p>
<p>No one is a Pedophile until we can prove it. If it's a link or 2 deep from the summary page, we already know. Be methodical. Don't give up. Don't accuse people of being a pedophile unless you know they are a pedophile. Don't call someone a racist unless you know they are a racist (Alefantis). Most importantly, don't take your internet anger into their real world. </p>
<p>If/when we actually find a smoking gun, we need to make sure that we save the shit out of the page. I'm saving pages with chrome when I find something really new as well as dropping shit into archives. If you really find something, make sure you torrent and get a few trusted people to download and see before you announce so the evidence can be distributed. </p>
<p>Good luck</p></p>

<p><p>Whenever our motives or evidence gets questioned, just tell people to look at Tony Podesta's art collection.  In the context of pedophelia accusations, his art collection would pique anyone's interest.</p>
<p>Pictures speak a thousand words and Tony Podesta's art collection is the tl;dr of why suspicions of pedophelia might be justified.  Its the most obvious thread people unfamiliar with PizzaGate can start tugging on for themselves.</p></p>

<p><p>His association may well be just a series of tragic alliances and associations. If this is the case he, as an innocent man, would want transparency to show everyone the truth of his innocence.
How better to do so, than to allow cadaver and blood dogs to inspect his fine Family establishment.
Consider it a next-level health inspection, that would clear your property of our now growing suspicions.</p></p>

<p><p>Dude, if you own a DC restaurant and it gets out that cadaver dogs did a pass through your place, you might as well lock up on you way out and throw away the key. </p>
<p>The place is odd, but they are into odd shit. There have been hundreds of people going through everything we could possibly find on this guy and all we turned up were some pictures that 'we' decided were code for shit, as if every person that has a yellow necklace is telling the world they are a pedophile, and that friends don't call each other gross names as a joke. </p>
<p>I call my buds names just like these guys do. I have family and friends with young children. I'm sure most of the people here are in the same boat. Imagine if the level of suspiciousness applied to these guys was applied to you. Everyone would be certain that you were a satanist pedophile, and when they find after a few weeks that there isn't anything there, you could finally make it all go away by having a cadaver dog cruise your house...</p>
<p>This place was stumbled upon, we were uncomfortable with a few pictures, and somehow this place is the epicenter of the 7,000 person DC pedophile network. We really never added anything to them, and at this point, I think we need to take this massive amount of potential and turn it in a different direction because this place is clearly a dead end. </p></p>

<p><p>"James Alefantis" is almost synonymous with "J'aime l'enfant" (French for "I love children"). It's almost like he is teasing us. </p></p>

<p><p>Guys, we all want to find a link that pushes us forward, but he has family with the same last name. This is so much different than most of the conspiracies that are seen on this site because we can get the little details if we look. He has family and they are his friends on Facebook. Just go look at his friends list. Problem solved. </p></p>

<p><p>That was me. The reason is everyone started with him and Comet. We have put probably hundreds of cumulative hours into him and his club. Meanwhile, Epstein's black book is just sitting there. </p>
<p>And we haven't proven shit. We have a lot of circumstantial evidence, but most of that points to the Podestas, Clintons and the Haiti group. But beyond that, we have pictures from the restaurant he owns. Yeah, some of the comments are questionable, but maybe the guy has that kind of a sense of humor. </p>
<p>But we haven't connected him to anything beyond association. I don't think it's cool to call some one a pedophile that traffics children without any proof. It's really fucked up. </p></p>

<p><p>There is enough evidence out there to convince me that this isn't some random "crackpot" "whacky" conspiracy snipe hunt. It's not like i'm saying the moon is made of cheese or something. If this guy was really innocent, why doesn't he address the evidence and claims presented against him and set the record straight for us? Not only that, but he attacked the people who made claims against him with the race card. When people are guilty, they don't refute evidence, they attack the accusers. I agree, we should maintain that he is innocent until proven guilty in a court. But public opinion has deemed this guy guilty a long time ago, and public opinion usually reflects reality.</p></p>

<p><p>If it were me, and a bunch of people I don't know are calling me a pedo, I'm not jumping into their world to investigate myself so I can prove it wrong.</p>
<p>Also, you can't prove a negative. And if there really aren't any specifics, just a bunch of loose connections, you can't say "I was here on this date" because we don't have any. We haven't even put anything together with enough facts that he could disprove it with other facts. </p>
<p>Can't disprove your feelings about a guy. </p></p>

<p><p>What is this, 12 angry men?....</p>
<p>Are you just going to ignore intuition on this? In legitimate investigations, the investigator saw a certain amount of initial evidence that convinced them a crime was potentially being commited, and further investigation was necessary, right?</p>
<p>If a police department was looking into this, and were seriously investigating this mount of evidence we are talking about (twitter photos, wikileaks emails, use of pedophilia related codewords in said emails, the way these businesses and people implicated reacted by deleting their shit) It would be more than enough links and strange coincidences to convince them that further investigation is necessary. Especially if it involved fucking child traffiking. A smart person can peice together an image of if/how a crime is being committed or if something strange is going on, and theres more than enough evidence here to come to that conclusion.</p>
<p>I think further investigation is absolutely necessary here. What you're saying is, "Drop it, theres nothing incriminating so lets move on". Wheres the logic in that? </p></p>

<p><p>I agree some strange shit has been found, but there is a big division between strange and raping children. What I'm saying is that there isn't anything we could point to and say that this guy actually does anything beyond running these restaurants. We are looking for !Facts! that can !Prove! that a !Crime! happened. We don't have anything on him beyond some odd shit that WE say means this or that, with absolutely no facts to back any of it up. So, lets have an example.</p>
<p>Ok. I'm the D.A. </p>
<p>Present the evidence you have that I can take in front of a judge to charge James Alefantis with a crime. </p></p>

<p><p>And I'm saying stop trying to pump a dry well and look at places that might be better, like Podesta Group on Open Secrets, or download the Portugal files over night. Nothing new coming out of here except people pointing out the same debunked shit from 2 days ago claiming the cracked the case and call the FBI nonsense. </p></p>

Also, how do you feel about the chocolate waterfall at Golden Corrall...Isn't it kinda weird knowing little kids probably dipped their booger picking hands in there? And then you just dip a strawberry in there like everything is hunkey dorey? Yuck....</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah, this specific point really detracted from what was otherwise a good post. I'm not sure why the OP would want to come to Jame's defense unless he knows him personally. James said and posted some fucked up stuff on his Instagram, which is incriminating enough by its own. Add in all of the other links, and there's no way I'm just going to give James a get out of jail free card. </p>
<p>James is free to defend his honor and give his side of the story. He needs to address all of the concerns and evidence provided in this investigation, and not just call us racist homophobes. Such behavior is indicative of guilt: when you can't deny the accusations, attack the accusers</p></p>

<p><p>Yea, he said a lot of good information and carefully placed a turd in the middle. While I agree this man is innocent until proven guilty in the courts, in the public eye, he's pretty guilty...Seems counter intuitive to me. </p></p>

<p><p>Holy shit. We haven't tied him to anything. We have stuff that we think looks strange, but we don't have any actual proof that he is in the mix on anything. We haven't found anything we can prove. I've been in this since the beginning and hundreds of people have looked into him and we actually have less on him since there was some stuff we explained since then. </p>
<p>I'm saying we are setting a really low bar to harass people for being pedophiles. If we get something new, and he's involved, we can do that, but think of how fucked up it is to invade someone's life and attempt to call him a pedo with no real evidence. </p></p>

<p><p>I agree with everything you just typed, but the logic doesn't match your original post. We haven't tied <em>anyone</em> to anything, and we likely never will find a smoking gun by using publicly available information alone. Right now we're working on assumptions based off of the available evidence.</p>
<p>Given that, how can you say that you think James is innocent, but the people around him are involved? That makes no sense unless you have some inside knowledge like knowing these people. The evidence is just as damaging and incriminating for James as it is for the others</p></p>

<p><p>Oh... should I leave it in? I could change it, but then your comment wouldn't make any sense.</p>
<p>I think it's in everyone's best interest if Anthony Wiener changes his name. Everyone is pretty committed to the text as it is, and Anthony Wiener is probably going to need to change his name, look and location. </p>
<p>We won't even hear about him again until some 15 year old girl runs out of her bedroom and explains that some creep just sent her a dick pick. Then, in unison, we'll all say "Whelp, that's my Wiener". </p>

<p><p>Huh. This probably doesn't mean anything to you, but I'm proud of you for writing this. It's rational and level-headed and uses calm logic. </p>
<p>The thing that frustrates me about much of this sub not acknowledging this point of view is that what you outlined above is a much more realistic route to uncovering real information.  </p></p>
