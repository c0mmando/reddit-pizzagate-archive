        <strong>Fundamentally, it's not pedophilia -- let's think about the motives and psyches of these people</strong>
        <p><p>Note: this is speculative in nature and does not constitute empirical evidence, but it is important to reflect on the broader facets of this. </p>
<p>What we're dealing with here, on a fundamental level, is not just a few neighborhood pervs fondling children. That is certainly involved, and it is horrendous. </p>
<p>But there seems to be something much deeper at work.</p>
<p>For some reason, they are inducing severe pain and trauma. </p>
<p>We need to pause and seriously consider the question: what human being would enjoy torturing small children as a hobby?</p>
<p>Another way of phrasing the question: if you had a billion dollars tomorrow, what would be on your list of things to do? Would "torturing small children" ever cross your mind? </p>
<p>Pick out your most devoted experience junkie, and still, they would never dream of torturing a child. Even if they did, they would stop at one. Certainly they would not make a lifestyle out of it. </p>
<p>But yet that is what we find with these people. It is their lifestyle. </p>
<p>It is not sex-driven, fundamentally. </p>
<p>This is beyond debauchery and libertinage of the sort portrayed by Marquis de Sade.</p>
<p>Further, ask yourself: why would these people go through so much trouble, building secret locations and developing hidden languages and such, if all they want to do is torture a child? </p>
<p>This appears to be an addiction for these people, something they need, something they have to do. </p>
<p>It's almost as if we're hunting a race of vampires. </p>
<p>I'm being metaphorical, of course. I don't really believe that. </p>
<p>But it is strange that so many of these people seem to make this a lifestyle. They aren't doing it for mere fun, or for money, or experience, or debauchery. They seem to need it. </p>
<p>What kind of human being needs to do something like this? </p>
<p>What are they gaining from it? </p>
<p>Another note. We all know Podesta had that Dahmer sculpting. I get the sense that he and his gang of monsters think to themselves "Dahmer is one of us, and went down because he didn't have the money and political power to disguise his addiction.  Poor guy."</p>
<p>I'm not trying to scare anyone or sound crazy. But all indications point to this being something much deeper than an act of child molestation. </p>
<p>They seem incredibly bloodthirsty, to the point where it is their way of life. These aren't just demented thrill-seekers. </p>
<p>To be more specific, I think this involves cannibalism of infants. </p>
<p>And I'm sure the following thought has occurred to others besides me. That they chose "pizza" was not an accident. It could be that the infants they cannibalize... there is so much tissue and blood involved in the mess they make, they are likening it to the cheese and sauce in pizza. </p>
<p>Sorry to say this, but I'm beginning to think the root of the issue involves cannibalism and ritual of some sort.  </p>
<p>This is a sidenote to the actual investigation, not trying to tinfoil hat the group here, just a sobering realization. </p></p>

        <p><p>Some say the torture on children creates extreme trauma for the child, triggering compartmentalization of their minds as a defense mechanism, which allows them to become Manchurian candidates or just puppets in doing whatever they are told to do. Supposedly, this is what the MKUltra program is about, to create candidates for assassins and executors of secret operatives. </p>
<p>But in this case, I truly think the rich &amp; elite torture children  as a gesture to please and worship satanic forces. They feed off energy from these pure, innocent souls. In return, I suppose they get power, money, or anything they desire. </p>
<p>But if they already have everything in the world, I guess the only reason they're doing this is because if they STOP, the forces will take away everything they have. Perhaps a blackmail situation.</p>
<p>Because it's hard to fathom why anyone would do this to children.</p></p>

        <p><p>I feel like they glorify Marina Abramovic and she's some sort of mentor/spirit leader. I read in one of her interviews her primary goal is to further her body and mind, to push it to the limits. And she looks pretty good for a 69 year old. I know tinfoil hat, but I agree these people aren't doing it to get off or experience a thrill, it's a lifestyle.</p>
<p>If it is so secretive and held by he most powerful, it probably invokes and acquires/retains power. I'm assuming they know something we all don't know.</p>
<p>This shouldn't distract from pizzagate and the need to take these people down. But I think could explain their motive.</p></p>

        <p><p>im a multi millionaire retired(not from the us)
ive been following this whole scandal, pretty interesting. And i felt i'm more inclined to respond to this thread:</p>
<p>When people get richer and more powerful, they tend to seek out more daring satisfactions,
most successful people also come with a weakness, like me
i'm also very inclined to "the more difficult to obtain, the more i want it"
The more money i made, the more kinds of food, different women i date. And i notice each step of the way, i get more and more bored of things. I however, do NOT have any pedophile fantasies nor anything to do with killing, though minor incriminating fantasies are enticing just to dream about.</p>
<p>I am pretty exposed to elite social circles, i can guarantee you, some of them have really weird fantasies. I've been to 1 or 2, nothing illegal, but definitely very out of the norm. I gave up socializing with any of them a long time ago. But i'm pretty sure if i dive deeper, it would get weirder the richer the circle got. Most of which borderline illegal and/or sexual and/or sadistic.</p>
<p>What you're seeing here is simply the curiosity of trying to get things that are more difficult to obtain. Meaning, the more taboo it is, the more interesting. 
I would pay up to $10k a meal just to have a new taste on my tongue(i still have morale values mind you). But i'm aware of people whose morales drop inversely to their increasing status and money.</p>
<p>Some can be sexual-
the most taboo of the sexual fantasy or pornography is children.
some can be food-
the most taboo of food fantasies is cannibalism
some can be brutality-
watching animals kill each other is a first step, more taboo than that would be humans.</p>
<p>tldr: the more taboo it is, the more people want it in ratio to their status. Don't ask me what it takes to break the moral boundaries, because i'm not in that category.</p>
<p>What you are witnessing in this entire scandal, is a mix of everything. </p></p>

        <p><p>Some satanists believe having sex with children and eat them brings them everlasting life.
They don't just get enjoyment from it they feel it makes them more powerful. See they believe in maximizing experiences aka pure hedonism. To try more is to be more. </p></p>

        <p><p>wanted to add that children are the perfect victim for pedos - trusting in adults (esp relatives), not understanding what is happening to them, easily forgets, doesn't talk about it - easily manipulated, etc</p>
<p>no teen or adult would be a victim in this shit knowingly (of course some love it)</p></p>

        <p><p>I remember reading/hearing somewhere that some satanists physically and sexually torture their victims before they kill them because then the victims' blood is filled with adrenaline. Drinking that blood is supposed to give a special "high" or "rush" that these people become addicted to.</p>
<p>I have no absolutely no idea if this is true or not, just wanted to mention it. </p></p>

        <p><p>That's a great way to dispose of bodies mix them with pizza ingredients and serve them to unsuspecting customers..
Also.. if there was some type of magik powers gained by eating children you could multiply that power by feeding it to people that didn't know..if you knew how to perform the spell properly.<br>

        <p><p>**MOTIVE AND AGENDA EXPLAINED OF SATANIC RITUAL ABUSE MILITARY DEMONIC SUPER SOLDIER PROGRAM - SOUL FRACTURING FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEMONIC POSSESSION AND SATANIC SLEEPER AGENTS</p>
<p>"The Worldwide SRA Agenda Summation</p>
<p>Although unpleasant to comprehend, there is a worldwide Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) agenda, which promotes the main methods behind the Archontic Deception Strategy that can be easily seen covertly operating in a variety of social structures, such as the medical system. Once we are informed by how this method works to create sociopaths, as it is reinforced in the unconscious minds of the people, we can safeguard and protect ourselves from being further manipulated. It is our informed awareness and spiritual commitment to serve our highest expression that ultimately protects us from being used and abused unconsciously. For this reason, we have summarized the basic recipe for grooming sociopathic minds through SRA methods:</p>
<p>Trauma Based Mind Control for Enslavement: Intentionally create conditions that manifest as much pain, torture and trauma at the earliest stages of childhood, and reinforce and grow that trauma response, into the stages of adulthood, so that spiritual abuse is normalized and accepted within the self, others and in the societal structures. SRA is trauma based mind control used to enslave people.</p>
<p>Abuse Spiritual Principles to Reject Soul: Abuse spiritual principles in all forms of social control that isolate and disconnect that structure and its people from feeling their natural co-existence with unified spiritual consciousness. Intend to groom self-hatred and hatred for that which is most sacred in the spiritual principles of God. Condition people to unconsciously commit grave harm to themselves and to others without feelings of remorse or taking responsibility for personal actions. Introduce and reinforce a variety of anti-Soul ideological beliefs into the public. SRA mind control is used to agitate people to get them to feel rejected, angry, and victimized, to desire retaliation against their oppressors (or others they blame), which sets them up for the bondage loop of consciousness enslavement.</p>
<p>Disassociate, Fragment and Dehumanize People: When people experience extreme pain and trauma abuse, (especially, when trauma events are repeated and never given the ability to heal) they will disassociate from their body and the reality to get relief. At the moment of disassociation, they fragment in their mind, emotional layers and spiritual body. This disconnects their lightbody layers and the functions between the mind and soul, which results in an energetically fractured, dehumanized and extremely fragile self. Abused and abusive people have no sense of emotional coherence, personal boundaries or self-respect, which allows for them to be easily mind controlled and prepared for further dark infiltration and consciousness enslavement. The individuals are purposely dehumanized to think of themselves as animals and to behave as animals (or even less than, generally, animals do not torture for sport). Dehumanized, they are easily fragmented, weakened and confused"</p>
<p>*** MY ADDITIONAL NOTE * this is what this extreme trauma agenda is about. Eyes wide open.
Attract and Spread Negative Spirits and Satanic Forces: Painful spiritual fragmentation creates energetic splitting behaviors, which disconnects all components of the many layers that exist within the human being, separating aspects of their consciousness into different realms of time and space. An example is the agenda to split apart the inner female from the inner masculine consciousness to produce external sexual misery and misogyny. This internal split and fracture of the Soul attracts negative spiritual entities that can form attachments. They take advantage of energetic weakness by manipulating that person’s pain, in order to gain further access, to control some layer of their mind, body or spirit. The negative entity feeds on the energy yielded from the source of pain that human being creates. This cycle of parasitism increases the spiritual wounding, which will produce sub personalities.</p>
