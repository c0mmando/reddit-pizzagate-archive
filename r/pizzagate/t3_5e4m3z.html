        <strong>This sub is being MEGA CENSORED. Mods explain immediately - Why have you deleted the contents of this post?</strong>
        <p><p><strong>EDIT: Mod explained the reason - it's because I listed the names of 2 Twitter accounts which were publicizing the CP host accounts. I have deleted the Twitter usernames from the post and mod has allowed the post to be shown again.</strong> Please everyone, do not post anything that directly links to this stuff so our sub doesn't risk getting banned. Our mods are working hard to prevent this - let's help them by reporting if you find it, as I will. Thanks for the explanation, u/newfoundland_urth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, the post should be on the top list with ~490 upvotes right now. Secondly, you deleted the original post contents - why? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For everyone reading, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e2zax/arrest_jack_dorsey_for_allowing_the_distribution/">this is the post in question.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important to note: It's a shadow-post deletion. It appears as if it hasn't been deleted when I view it (I'm the OP). From my account everything looks normal. But if any other account views it, it shows the content as having been deleted. Shady as fuck.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the original post contents:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Hundreds... no, thousands of Twitter accounts are being found with CP! Indict every single one of those motherfuckers who own these accounts displaying CP. Arrest and indict Jack Dorsey for distributing CP on his website. Justice needs to be served. This can NOT go unpunished. Get this to r/all</em></p>
<p><em>Search</em>  <strong>redacted</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>redacted</strong> <em>on Twitter to see where people are tagging with pedo accounts, but be warned of what you will find if you look deeper. Tons and tons of accounts hosting, sharing, liking, and retweeting CP. What a fucking awful world we live in.</em></p>
<p><em>By the way... Jack Dorsey is on the Board of Directors for Disney.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Demanding an immediate explanation, please.</strong></p></p>

        <p><p>This is a HUGE scandal, even without pizzagate. We should spread the news to Twitter competitors. Also the reason was on the other thread: No links to accounts that tie wtih CP.</p>
<p>Twitter deserves it, they're protecting elite pedophile rapists after all, by filtering #pizzagate. </p></p>

        <p><p>YOU CAN'T LINK TO CP.  IT IS A FELONY.  IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT COMES FROM TWITTER OR THE DARKWEB</p>
<p>Feel free to discuss, the evidence but any thread with direct links (again it doesn't matter if its twitter) is going to be removed.  It is a violation of Reddit TOS to link to CP.  If you care about this sub, I hope you understand.</p></p>

        <p><p>I didn't link to CP! I listed 2 twitter usernames without linking anything. One of the Twitter users who has been ousting the accounts is on the top list and is directly discussing it in an AMA. Please allow the post contents to be shown on the top list and not as deleted. I have removed the Twitter accounts from the OP. (Btw there are several threads with the names of the Twitter users ousting the CP accounts still up...)</p></p>

        <p><p>thank you.  report any direct links.  I agree this is important, I just had a minor freak out when I realized people were literally linking CP on a sub dedicated to preventing it.</p></p>

        <p><p>I understand. It was pretty late at night when all of this dropped, I am sure most of you guys might have been asleep and woke up to a mass posting of this stuff. Thanks for uncensoring it after I removed the Twitter accounts. I will report all of the posts I saw with the links still up shortly.</p></p>

        <p><p>yeah I was driving this morning to a different job site, and was browsing from an alternate.  There wasn't anything I could do until the damage was done.  While this is a massive development, we do not want to get caught up in the legal ramifications.  Thanks for understanding.  It was easier to remove the posts then check every comment.  I figured we would circle back and clean it up when we have more support/time.  This sub is getting unruly and huge (good thing), but we were not ready for this huge twitter development.</p></p>
