    the rabbit hole we are jumping down is frightening, disgusting, painful, and incites anger. these are normal feelings and it is okay to feel them. however this isnt the first time ive got wrapped up in this "NWO" type rhetoric and i know the effects its had on me in the past.
   </p>
   <p>
    i believe what you guys are doing is necessary and noble but remember to find room for happiness in your life. do not let fear and anger dictate your day to day. it is through fear that we make ourselves susceptible to disinformation and it is fear mongering that has held us under control through the 4th branch. obsession and fear will be this movements downfall and will be how people discredit us as conspiracy theorists. be angry, be disgusted, but do not let fear, anger, and obsession take control of your life. its through those that we lose perspective, rationality, and our ability to think critically.
   </p>
   <p>
    godspeed /r/pizzagate. keep fighting the good fight. remember though, there is nothing to fear but fear itself.

    I went a couple weeks without going to the gym every day like I normally do (not because I am afraid of getting barbelled - I was just depressed).  I was mainly depressed because I felt the pizzagate news wasn't blowing up like I thought it would.  But progress is being made.  I have now made it back to my regular schedule for the last 5 days and am feeling much better.  A healthy mind and body are important for facing huge obstacles such as this investigation.

     This is such a disturbing subject, and the content and connections are bound to poison any reasonable person's mind. I too have had to remind myself to keep up with my healthy routine to stay balanced.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's just that I can't wrap my mind around how anybody could harm or exploit a child. I mean really it's just fucked up, and here we have these freaks trying to say that it's just funny art and that they just joke this way, etc. It's not a joke it's sick.
    </p>
    <p>
     I don't think any honest person on this sub can't see that there is a child abuse/trafficking ring being exposed before our eyes. When is law enforcement going to intervene? I'm hoping against hope that they are investigating and preparing to do their jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
     BTW, has Podesta made any statement regarding this? It was his emails that started this shit-storm and he and his brother have been accused of the most heinous shit possible. I'd be professing my innocence from the rooftops.

      I agree that the lack of intervention is a major reason I have trouble wrapping my mind around this.  I think plenty of people have probably tried and just been outright murdered by the perpetrators of the ring.  That is why I am now a gun nut when I never owned one a couple months ago.  Podesta is clearly staying out of the spotlight as much as possible.  Hell, the majority of Hillary supporters griping about the election results don't even know who he is.

      If you were raised your entire life being taught that your 'class' was above all of the other peasants in the world that are working and paying taxes to you, and also if you were taught that pedophilia was OK or a delicacy even, and all of your mentors were all doing it, you probably wouldn't think it was that bad.  Also blend that in with the fact that some people are just naturally disposed to 'liking' it as their sexual preference, and/or it is a normal practice in some cult thing that your entire circle follows.  Its a recipe for disaster

       I personally don't give a shit about how they got this way, or the sociology of these perverted groups. Of course they are products of their environments just like the rest of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       My philosophy is that any person should be able to do anything (and I mean anything) they wish freely UNLESS those actions or behaviors cause harm to others, or impact others in an unwanted way. Crime against children is an ultimate and inexcusable wrongdoing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I know this wasn't your meaning, but any sex that is non-consensual isn't a sexual preference. It's a predatory perversion.

        Yea, I mean - I agree with you; I wasnt trying to make an excuse for them, just trying to understand the enemy.
       </p>
       <p>
        But even if you look at how different we are from the hyper-left who aren't necessarily pedophiles but are enablers because they actively voted for HRC- it doesn't really shock me to realize that there are people who look at this shit and literally believe with all of their being that it is OK.  That's what we are up against.  An enemy that is so diluted that they actually justify these crimes for themselves that we have agreed upon as a society to be inexcusable

    One fact I know is that child trafficking is on the rise at the moment.

    The Clinton foundation traffics people and sells them to their friends in Saudi, elites around us and Europe, and keeps some for themselves.  Their money is laundered through a network of art dealers, restaurants (not just pizza) and in other ways.  The FBI has a lot of this info and when trump is sworn in he's going to blow it all up via proxy through his appointments.  Watch

    Fuck that, if we find any inexcusable evidence of child extortion, we're taking this to the top.
Let's be frank here; who among us would not feel physically enraged if even half of this stuff were true.
