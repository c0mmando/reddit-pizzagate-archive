        <strong>Strand on Volta - a Georgetown art gallery run by Alefantis 10 years ago</strong>
        <p><p>A description of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2003/10/10/strand-on-volta-cuts-in-to-some-meaty-issues/8a433284-af01-4d27-aff1-2afd819a815b/">Meat and You</a>, one of his exhibits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ODDLY ENOUGH, amid all the images of flesh on view in Strand on Volta's latest group exhibition, shown along with examples of some less readily identifiable bodily tissue/fluid sculpted from molten glass -- teeth? a jawbone? sperm? tears? -- the word that springs to mind is not "meat" but "plastic." As in pliable, capable of being molded, able to deform continuously and permanently without rupturing.</p>
