   <strong>
    state of the subreddit
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I have some commentary on the situation as I currently see it. I've been following since the migration of operation_barenstain/cheeseybay, and have contributed little due to lack of confidence in my ability to do so. However, since thursday (november 17th) I have seen absolutely no progress occur to further the case and mission of the subreddit. Instead of the subreddit focusing it's energy on the issue itself, it has turn into a /r/pizzagatemeta wherein the top posts are either: focusing on how to wade through bullshit posts, bullshit posts themselves, or extreme skeptics coming from other subreddits discrediting any work done in this reddit as inane and stupid, putting an unrelenting and undeserved amount of faith, trust, and intelligence in the "powers that be" for whatever reason.
I understand strength in numbers, but even in the own subreddit, those who have done good work are outnumbered.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Up until this weekend, all strong leads of evidence have simply been found by searching public domain. This influx of "insiders &amp; hackers" who to the technologically inclined are an obvious farce and simply throwing technical jargon around to "legitimize" their posts are actually endangering those with less technical background by linking directly to illegal material. Somebody has to draw the line somewhere,  if not at that, then I have no idea what.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    The disinformation, mass confusion, the energy spent alerting others that it exists is causing real time to go by and effectively allowing all leads togo stale whilst others collude to quickly stop operating in plainsight. While it would be nice in an ideal world to have hundreds if not thousands of people participating in a search to uncover the truth, I suggest the mods of this subreddit make another subreddit and have it private and invite only those they have trusted as safe contributors and individuals up to now. For the record, I don't expect to meet that criteria. I'm not special. My wish to help is genuine and even if my proposal excludes me from helping further, what is going on currently is simply not okay.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Mods, please take this suggestion seriously and find a comfortable private space to operate. The front page of the subreddit is full of nonsense and meta discussion. Last monday it was full of circumstansial leads and extremely well put together infographics. This subreddit should only be used further for posting detailed and informative stickies, while the rest of the posts should probably be disregarded as cynicism, bullshit, and potentially dangerous material.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Just my two cents.
   </p>
   <p>

    Edit: Already, being downvoted. post time, 2 minutes.

    Thank you to /u/deathtokidfuckers for assisting me in a method to get this actually posted after multiple failed attempts due to browser crashes.

     A big problem is the outside influence on this. I had an old account banned from here after doing tons and tons of research when this first broke out. Before that a bunch of my links and comments started disappearing and I found myself in a mess to try and put it all together. Someone was actually deleting the most incriminating stuff at the server level, so someone with very privileged access was manipulating things and also messing with the "new" algorithm when this story started breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
     CTR or the lurking pedo shills are turning this sub into exactly the problem you're describing. It actually had decent discussion and we were connecting leads but now things are just overloaded with nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
     Anyways not sure what the next step is, I think the word is out about Pizzagate, I've already red-pilled most of my friends. But yeah this place has been pretty compromised as of late.

      The word does seem out but it also seems to be diluted heavily by batshit crazy, off the wall ideas that shouldn't present themselves at a time where only the strongest leads are going to convince a majority of people who have unwavering disbelief in such a scandal to even occur. A quick look at the "new posts" tab,  people posting about occultic figurines representing a pizza oven, people talking about Aleister Crowley, etc...While that may all be well and good at a different time, in a different subreddit, those people lumping it in at such a sensitive time and possible tipping point are just ruining it totally IMO.

    hear hear, Ive been on here for a week, and these last 2 days have become almost unmanageable, and have felt very different. I definitely feel like we are hitting a nerve somewhere and getting a lot of response/action here as a result. I agree mods should be reducing the amount of shit threads that are surfacing here, almost 60%+ seems to be distracting/vague/useless/crazy..

    I agree.  I am mostly a lurker, not doing much actual research.  The subreddit seems bloated, no longer as nimble as it once was.  Your suggestion seems like a possible solution.

    I think this would be a good place for people to prove they can assist in the research and from here be allowed into a more private group, this is also a good way of releasing the proven evidence from that group so those of us who are not killed at research can help spread it publicly.
