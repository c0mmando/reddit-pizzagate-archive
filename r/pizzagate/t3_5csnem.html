        <strong>Lovettesville ranch house</strong>
        <p><p>Anyone realize the google maps view of the ranch had no pool at all for the kids to "swim" in?</p></p>

        <p><p>Link to the google maps in question? How did you locate the ranch? Are you sure it's the right one? Please provide something we can use to verify. </p>
<p>Edit to add: in the relevant email, they were talking about a farm, not a ranch house. Something to keep in mind. </p></p>

        <p><p>I looked at it. It does have a pool. It's in the backyeard with a grey cover over it.  It's an enormous pool, nearly the length of the whole house. </p>
<p>Take a close look at the property though. Across the street from the house is a garden. About 40yds aqay from the garden is either a well or a hatch. Could be a facility of some sort underground there underneath the garden.  </p></p>
