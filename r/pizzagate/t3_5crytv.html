        <p><p>Thank you for posting this! I found this earlier but the thread I posted didn't get much traction. <strong>He said this way back in 2008!!!</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cqrgf/article_from_2008_about_frank_winstead_accusing/">https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cqrgf/article_from_2008_about_frank_winstead_accusing/</a></p>
<p>I found some more information about Frank Winstead from the articles. Apparently he was an Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC) representative. By looking up his address, he appears to be in <a href="http://anc.dc.gov/page/advisory-neighborhood-commission-3f">Ward 3F</a></p>
<p>I wonder if there are minutes of the meeting around June 24, 2008 with his exact comments. Don't meetings like this usually have someone taking down notes of everything that is said?</p>
<p>Also, here are his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/fwinstead/featured">youtube</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fwinstead">Linked In</a> pages. His linked in page also says he was previously "District of Columbia Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3F"</p>
<p>EDIT: Formatting</p></p>
