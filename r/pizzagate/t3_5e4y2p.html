        <strong>Boats...</strong>
        <p><p>If a client list has GPS coordinates, there's a good chance it could be that. Especially with steel walls. A ship can travel all around the world.</p>
<p>For fuel, searched, etc, they could travel in twos. One clean to dock and take on fuel/supplies and then to travel back to supply the ship in international waters. There are probably safe docks in parts of the world for dirty ships to stop at.</p>
<p>Can easily dispose of bodies, shark food, etc. Works similarly to casino ships. Lots of rich people have private yachts, etc. Lots of ship owners at the moment have a downturn as well I believe, can't make profit from their ships, upkeep is too high, can't even sell them.</p>
<p>It would explain a lot...</p></p>

        <p><p>This is very insightful.  It also would explain why all nations are so supportive of keeping international waters outside any jurisdiction.</p></p>
