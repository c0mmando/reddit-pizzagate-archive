    I don't know if this is anything meaningful but it just seemed out of place. The email has nothing to do with a Macy's holiday $50 gift. I've never been to Macy's but I imagine they're not selling pizza and pasta.
   </p>
   <p>
    The URL link that is provided also seems strange. I tried to follow it but 'page not found'.

      New Haven is known for good pizza amongst people in new england.  Could be unrelated.

    That's just spam. Spambots include text of that nature to make it past the Bayesian filters. Macy's ain't asking people to visit anything dot top.
   </p>
   <p>
    Could be an attempt to social engineer recipient's password.
   </p>
   <p>
    Regardless, it's just gibberish.

     I don't understand how this is just gibberish? Within this email is clearly a strange message that is completely unrelated to the fact that the subject title is
     <strong>
      Use your Macy's pre-holiday $50 gift at your local store
     </strong>
     . Explain more how it's "gibberish" despite that this message is coincidentally pizza-related, please.

      They are copying what they hope is human written text from review sites to make each spam email seem to be individual.
     </p>
     <p>
      The first sentence from your quote in your post ("Absolutely wonderful food! Went on Pasta Night, had the special homemade ravioli in pink sauce with crab. The ravioli were exceptional--al dente &amp; fresh") is from this yelp review.  https://www.yelp.com/biz/sorianos-cafe-peckville
     </p>
     <p>
      This quote: "Every Memorial Weekend, it's tradition my family goes to Aj's before the madness of our Memorial party the following day" comes from this review.  https://www.yelp.com/biz/ajs-club-soda-peckville
     </p>
     <p>
      In the original email, they probably hid this "gibberish" so it wasn't visible (i.e. having a block at the bottom where text and background is same color).  That got stripped out in the all text version on wikileaks.

      The "the service is very good and our waitress really took care of us" part in https://www.wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/14349 is from https://www.yelp.com/biz/tiffanys-tap-and-grill-eynon-3, posted in 9/16/2015, and the "excellent pizza" part is from https://www.yelp.com/biz/andys-pizza-peckville, posted in 9/5/2015. Spambots often copy + paste stuff randomly from comments from Yelp, TripAdvisor and such to make it look like genuine mail to the filter in an attempt to bypass it. This is especially common when it comes to spam with just a link in it to make the e-mail longer to attempt to bypass the spam filter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also, the "Macy's 20 USD" thing is spread around is a known spam phrase:
http://diswww.mit.edu/bloom-picayune.mit.edu/sipb-afs/112877
     </p>
     <p>
      Of course, it may have been a bunch of pedos that went the extra-extra-route to be careful and wanted to make it look like a genuine spambot to be safe, I guess, but I doubt it.

       Thanks for the explanation. I guess we can't be sure. But I do find it curious that all of these are coming from a city called Peckville. Would a spam bot pick up texts all from the same city, yet different restaurants like that? It still seems quite odd to me.
