        <strong>Getting the truth out about "pizza recipes"</strong>
        <p><p>/pol/, r/conspiracy and r/the_donald are all compromised it seems. They bury all attempts to share "pizza recipes". So many people need to know about this mess.</p>
<p>We'd like to disseminate information for this cause but it would seem all social media is censored when it comes to trending topics. </p>

<p>I'd like this sub's aid in supplying tweets with the hashtag #Spicy to get this information to the public. Or send us links to videos or posts and we'll try getting "recipes" to the people. For those that cannot research, spreading the word is the best one can do for now. Suggestions always welcome.</p>
<p>Please do not give up on this cause. These people are animals.</p></p>
