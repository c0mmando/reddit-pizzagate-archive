    I can't find the source anymore but maybe was it worldnews or conspiracy? I forgot but it has an article about how in a church in England or u.k? Well they found hundreds of children's skeletons. They said they seemed to be sacrificed in the church. If I remember correctly it was mentioned how a lot of the powerful people of London visite that church so maybe was it anyway related to #Pizzagate? I have always told my friends about it but now it does make sense. If any one can help me find it I'll appreciate it.

    I heard a story of a nunnery near the small american town that I grew up in. a guy was cleaning out all the old soot from a long unused coal heating furnace and found a lot of infant skeletons that were apparently from the Spanish flu outbreak in the early 1900s

    I read something similar within the past few days- there are multiple places in the US that those kind of sites have been found- one I
    <em>
     think
    </em>
    was in Florida at either a school or a daycare, I can't remember which. I think I read that at just the one place they uncovered thousands of skeletons. This shit is too sickening.
