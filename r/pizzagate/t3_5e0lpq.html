<p>"Also had dinner with Skip, his daughter and her fianc√©e. He thinks you're great. <em>Today-dominos. We won't be calling you for the rules.</em>"</p></p>

        <p><p>Digging into it right now.....should hopefully have an answer by tonight.  It is someone big, who interacts with Podesta, Soros, Clinton and the like regularly.  But with just one first name it is posing as a challenge.  </p>
<p>Forgot to clarify, I am looking into who Skip is.  </p></p>

        <p><p>That is likely him.  I thought it could have been D.C. Nightlife advocate "Skip" Coburn, but he died on March 18th 2015, before the time of this email.  I think you found 'Skip'.  Thank you!  </p></p>

        <p><p>To the extent that this guy has a wikipedia page to his name, I think it's safe to assume that he is a public personality. And therefore, you don't run any risks posting his name here ;)</p></p>

        <p><p>shit so the guy likes to play dominos for real. after reading this it seems he is really referring to the actual game. there is no code here or any weird sentence</p></p>

        <p><p>To help guide you along the right path:  sophisticated people don't play dominos.  I don't mean this as a slam but dominos is an ethnic and neighborhood based game played by generational Americans.  It is most assuredly not a game played by elites, or power brokers.  </p>
<p>Do you really think John Podesta and Herb Sandler, two of the most powerful men in the entire world, get together to see who can match up a few white pegs on a black square to see who wins?  They don't play dominos....period.  </p>
<p>What they are talking about is some kind of code for sexual dominance......in this case, we're not playing "dominos" by your rules.  Meaning, they had their own sex party, with their own specified rules of "dominos", or S&amp;M Dominance.  </p></p>

        <p><p>yes i get the angle but the way he just throws it there like that seems so casually it makes u think they really talking about dominos. </p>
<p>But note that there is a picture of Podesta and the gang playing cards at Comet PP. The same picture we thought we found Madeleine Mccan. So elite from time to time can step down from playing golf and enjoy a random game of dominos or cards. These emails are speculation at this point.  </p></p>

        <p><p>selective-reasoning-people like you are keeping people off the pizzagate because if you give an opinion with a different angle you are considered a shill. Personally i don't give a shit about your kind but i am worried about new people who truly want to come and see some evidence, voice their investigative opinion only to then get bullied from weiners-heads like you.</p></p>
