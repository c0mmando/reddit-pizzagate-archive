        <strong>Guest of 10/06/15 Dinner - Questionable Tastes for line of work.</strong>
        <p><p>Going through the guest list of the big dinner referred to https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/21136 I noticed Anthony Green with Safe Kids Worldwide. Nimble dig finds https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208228760501705&amp;set=pb.1383284123.-2207520000.1479149206.&amp;type=3&amp;size=640%2C852</p>
<p>It's a play about 10 gay men learning about themselves sexually but it sounds pretty adult.</p>
<p>Now, BEFORE EVERYONE JUMPS ALL OVER THIS GUY keep in mind that adults are allowed to see adult things and from what I understand, homosexual nightlife is much more exotic than what most of us are used to. This is more for future reference if his name pops up again rather than using this as evidence of anything. Tuck it away. </p></p>

        <p><p>Anthony Green is the lead singer of several bands that I listen to. Insane if he is implicated...</p></p>
