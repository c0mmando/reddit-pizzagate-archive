        <p><p>ever stop to think Home Alone was made by pedos and is filled with code and references??  it wasnt trying to predict anything - this is just standard pedo code - "Little Nero"   "Cheese Pizza"  "Home Alone"</p>
<p>read my other comment in here about NERO</p></p>

        <p><p>And what would the overall goal or outcome be from filling Home Alone with these references? What could be achieved? </p></p>

        <p><p>conditioning kids maybe?   Im not sure what types of mind control they exactly use....maybe watching this film they could somehow trigger a personality to emerge/or to wipe their memory....I have no idea...seems like to enjoy flaunting secret code....I simply find it strange that this movie has multiple references </p></p>

        <p><p>Yup and they write books about "keeping a secret is something special" paraphrasing of course, but a whole lot of in your face BS. 
"Hey kids, 'Home Alone' shows you can handle being alone at home and it's ridiculous to think some bafoons would really do that"</p></p>

        <p><p>it IS a lawn jockey - but think about it - it IS the exact size of a small child, and jockeys are typicaly men of small stature - the could be a hidden meaning in this - I already decoded what "Little Nero" means (see my other comment in here) and it's pretty dark</p></p>

        <p><p>NERO was a sick pedo as well</p>
<p>"Nero ordered a young freedman (ex-slave), Sporus, to be <strong>castrated</strong> and then married him"</p>
<p>"(there were several) scandalous accounts of Nero's sexual aberrations, between his <strong>raping a vestal virgin</strong> and committing <strong>incest with his mother</strong>"</p>
<p>"Shortly before Nero's death, Sporus presented Nero with a ring depicting the <strong>Rape of Proserpina</strong>, in which the <strong>ruler of the underworld forces a young girl to become his bride</strong>"</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporus</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone</p>
<p>MY CONCLUSION - HOME ALONE IS PROBABLY FILLED WITH ALL SORTS OF PEDO REFERENCES</p>
<p>FFS!!!  THE ENTIRE PLOT INVOLVES A CHILD ALONE AND MEN TRYING TO GET HIM (UNDER THE GUISE OF A ROBBERY ) - SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING A PEDO WOULD FANTASIZE ABOUT</p>
<p>LETS LOOK FOR CLUES ON IMDB - WHO WROTE IT?? WHO PRODUCED IT?  ARE THEY AT ALL TIED TO THE HOLLYWOOD PEDO RING?</p>

        <p><p>It may well be how the term cheese pizza was dreamt up in the first place. Cause and effect...</p>
<p>But not really relevant in the investigation. But some light relief.</p></p>

        <p><p>This sub has ruined pizza and anything that references it.</p>
<p>Well, technically the pedo ring has ruined pizza. And countless lives.</p></p>
