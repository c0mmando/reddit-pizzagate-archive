<strong>Please: less speculation and more analysis</strong>
<p><p>What drew me in to the Pizzagate investigation was the wealth of hard evidence of weird crap surrounding this place and all the people clearly connected to it and their weirdness. But increasingly we're just getting wild hypotheses thrown out with no real evidence to back them up. This is particularly bad with idiots in the comments making grandiose and bombshell-level claims but give zero evidence and then disappear. It gets worse when others start getting emotionally fired up over such things, because it makes us look like gullible kooks. This shit needs to be locked down better. The detritus needs to be cleared away so we can focus on concrete leads. If we get overwhelmed in baseless noise, people will drift away.</p></p>

<p><p>Honestly, the links are running dry.</p>
<p>What would help now is collecting all the existing info and presenting it in a way which is easy to share and explain to others.</p>
<p>It's a bit of a cluster fuck at the moment.</p></p>

<p><p>Yup, been following 8chan threads. They're going off the deep end. Getting further and further from the initial source. Making weak connection after weak connection. It's like wading through shit</p></p>

<p><p>I noticed that, too. Getting obsessed with Satanic imagery; seeing it everywhere now. It's exactly that kind of thing that makes people who might otherwise be interested get freaked and close the window and not think about it again.</p></p>

<p><p>The more disinfo there is in here the less likely it is the sub will be taken seriously. This is a good thing.</p>
<p>The actual serious investigators will be able to keep track of the legit information and the disinfo will act as a smokescreen so spies won't have an easy time determining how far the investigation has gotten.</p></p>
