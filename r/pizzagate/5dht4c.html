    This is crazy. I remember reading about Max Spiers investigating UFOs. He strangely sent a text message to his mom saying he was in trouble 2 days before he died. I had no idea he was also investigating pedophilia run by the US army.

     It seems crazy but in reality there's a connection between the two; by that I mean UFOs and military pedophilia. Podesta talks a lot about UFOs in the WikiLeaks and Podesta is also a Jesuit. Jesuits answer to the black pope in the Vatican and the Vatican has been sitting on knowledge of extraterrestrials for centuries, as well as being the center of this whole pedophilia ring. Our military carries out orders on behalf of the Vatican, the people in control of the world banks. When a country denies the world bank, they are put on the Vatican's hitlist and we go decimate that country and "install" a "democratic" government there. Which really just means we force them to comply with the world bank.
    </p>
    <p>
     Spiers most likely started investigating UFOs, which led him to the military. He probably then found connections implying the military is complicit in these international pedophilia rings. We have a highly advanced, super secretive military that is confirmed to be commanded by pedophiles like Hillary. It isn't too much of a stretch to assume our military is complicit in the abduction and transferring of kids from countries we've decimated while trying to implement world banking. It'd be too easy, it's really the perfect crime.

       This. They're not UFO's like aliens, but UFO's like secret mil transport that has absolutely 0 way of anyone finding any info on them.

       Aliens.... and even catholics.... are not the focus here.

       The focus is United States politicians in Washington d.c.

      Fuck off with your dramatic bull shit that adds nothing of value to the story.
     </p>
     <p>
      Making it bigger and grander than it actually is just makes it confusingly enormous. It's a pretty good tactic if you want people to give up and resign themselves in to submission.

       Well buddy that was a bit harsh but you can kindly go fuck yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you look into it, if you actually gave a shit, used some intellect, and did some research, you'd see that the Podestas are jesuits. That means this goes higher up than you'll ever be able to comprehend unless you spend some time looking up the Jesuits. If we want an international pedophilia ring to stop, we have to take it all down. Sure we can throw stones at some D.C. Pizza joints and fry 2-3 small fish but if you'd like pedophilia to stop on a larger scale, it all needs to be exposed. The only way to do that is to face the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       You sound like a shill and I have news for you: you aren't the grand authority over pizzagate and you don't have control over anyone. You don't get to decide what is or isn't the focus of pizzagate. Shocking, I know.

         Nowhere did I personally ever say that aliens are shot callers for anything. all I did was link the interest of UFOs to the military and the Vatican. Read.

     I read about it too but don't you think it's more likely that he started feeling ill and chalked it up to "Damn NWO is killing me! Gotta let everyone know before I die!"?

    Are you fucking kidding me!

   <p>
    This just happened last month!
   </p>
   <p>
    10 minutes ago I finally read the big "The Mountain of Evidence for a Massive International Pedophile Ring Protected by Police and Intelligence Agencies" linked at the right. It talked about the Presidio and Satanism.
   </p>
   <p>
    10 minutes later I read about how the guy who was investigating that just died, a month ago, at a young age, for no apparent reason, spitting out black liquid, after warning his mother that if anything happens to him, investigate.
   </p>
   <p>
    Keep in mind:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     The Presidio scandal is associated with the Temple of Set
    </li>
    <li>
     The story of set explains the "14" symbol written on John Podesta's hand in his picture
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    This is unreal.

      The Temple of Set has been associated/accused with child trafficking for a long time, going back to the Presidio child scandal:
     </p>
     <p>
      http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/16/us/army-will-close-child-care-center.html
     </p>
     <p>
      Set is an Egyptian/occult god who is famous for cutting Osiris into 14 pieces.
     </p>
     <p>
      This is the third google hit for "set occult 14 phallus":
     </p>
     <p>
      http://www.collective-evolution.com/2015/06/18/the-surprising-hidden-meaning-of-the-washington-monument/
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice that, in the Temple of Set, Satan has revealed himself to have the name "Set."
     </p>
     <p>
      All of this, by itself, is not conclusive. But, when it is added with everything else, it seems damning.
     </p>
     <p>
      I have never heard a coherent explanation, from anyone, for why Podesta even held up his hands with a drawn fish symbol and 14 on them. I know he Tweeted it and emailed it, and I know that point 14 on a memo involved the ocean. I'm a lawyer and I handle memos - I don't drawing funny symbols on my hands, take a picture, and then Tweet/email them.

       This keeps getting more and more out there, maybe KEK is truly coming for Set. At this point I'm ready to not dismiss everything.

       Oh wow, looking at the wiki page for Osiris Myth/Conflict of Horus and Set (sorry no links cause I am on mobile) it describes Set sexually abusing Horus, asking him for sex, how for Egyptians semen is potent/dangerous. Apparently Isis retaliates by getting Set to eat Horus' semen.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really seems that hidden hands are battling out an ancient Egyptian grudge.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been doing my own research into Egyptian influence in America, the grand canyon, and Hollywood. Admittedly "out there" but then this kind of stuff pops up.

    Yeah, it was the Presidio scandal, where Lt Col Michael Aquino (that f'ing cretinous, pathetic excuse for a human being), was involved in abusing and murdering babies.  No kidding folks.  Five or six of the surviving victims ended up with STDs, and you don't get STDs from a baby bottle...
   </p>
   <p>
    A surprising addition to this story is that of our friend (NOT) Rudi Giuliani.  Guess who was the Federal Prosecutor brought into that case?  Our dear friend (NOT) Rudi.  And what he did was obfuscate the evidence, and squelched the investigation, and concluded that 'there wasn't enough evidence to move forward'!!!???  And trust me, there was and still is a mountain of evidence.
   </p>
   <p>
    So, our dear friend (NOT) Rudi, was rewarded with the plum Federal Prosecutor job in the USA--lower Manhattan, which of course he parlayed into the job as Mayor.
   </p>
   <p>
    Don't believe me...research it yourself.  It's freaking true.  I sure hope Trump gets him the he!! out of that adminstration!

     Look at it like Operation Snow White conducted by scientology.
    </p>
    <p>
     Only a very small number of people from scientology got in to government agencies but they were able to get in to a pretty wide range of activities.
    </p>
    <p>
     Don't get scared off by the "army" or the "cia" it is nowhere close to  all of the members of these agencies or organizations.... there are some important and powerful people involved, yes.... but if this shit gets undeniable you will have people breaking ranks or purging these fucks out of existence.

    I find that interview with his mother a little strange, but I'm not entirely sure why. Her body language is interesting. Any body language experts around to have a look?

    I could be wrong and she's just very matter of fact about her son's death.

     If higher ups are involved you can be assured lower enlisted are involved too, but unknowingly so. They may all just be helping the "big picture" whether they want to or not.
