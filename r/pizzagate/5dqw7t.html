    Cathy O'Brian thinks she's telling the truth but really her husband is the mind controller and abuser
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I left this in a comment on another [post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5djb3x/cathy_obrien_claimed_that_politicians_performed/), but I wanted to see if anyone else found this interesting.
   </p>
   <p>
    I believe Cathy O'Brian is being mind controlled in a way, but not in the way she is describing. While she very well may have been abused as a child, her husband, Mark Phillips, then exploited those experiences and is the one who is planting these idea's in her head. And she's not the only one. Shaela Miller moved in with Cathy and Mark for a job and then eventually cut off contact with a family she was close with, and is now making widely inflammatory accusations against her family and past.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mark is "ex" CIA with experience in mind control (don't have much info on this at the moment) and a google of his name will demonstrate he's not the best character.
   </p>
   <p>
    <a href="https://millerfamilyblogging.wordpress.com/">
     Here is a link to a blog created by Shaela Miller's family giving their side of the story. It's heartbreaking.

     And more

   </p>
   <p>
    [Here is an interview video with Mark Phillips, Cathy O'brien and Shaela Miller.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nir9mOWkj5c)  You can see how disjointed Shaela speaks now (according to friends and family she doesn't sound like herself at all anymore) and how Mark has to feed her details for her supposed own experiences.
   </p>

   </p>
   <p>
    I believe both Cathy O'Brien and Shaela Miller need to get the hell away from Mark because he is the abuser in this situation.

    Wouldn't the fact that she SOMEhow married an ex-supposed-mind-control-CIA-agent raise some red flags in the OTHER direction of suspicion?
I think you may need to UP your paranoia levels; what if he is ensuring her discredit?

    False Memory Syndrome is not recognized in the DSM, although WIkipedia claims it is "overwhelmingly accepted by scientists".
   </p>
   <p>
    The guy who coined the term did so after being accused of being molested by his daughter. I don't know whether False Memory Syndrome is real or not, but it seems like a pretty convenient way to dismiss abuse allegations. Here's the link to the story of Peter Freyd (who was molested as a boy) and the founding of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation. You should read it. It's pretty interesting.

     The DSM5 doesn't recognize "Islamophobia" either; wait till VI.

    not the only possibilities- she could have been abused/mked and essentially never escaped since she still has a handler (pretty clearly) and his CIA ties are yeah..

     oh yeah and just because she could be a victim with her husband handler doesn't necessarily mean she wasn't the programmer/handler/recruiter for shaela.

    Stay focused on the evidence. This distraction gives us nothing but hearsay.

    This is false. Read the book Cathy and Mark wrote detailing the experiences she endured as an MKUltra sex slave victim. He saved her. They have documentation to leave everything. If he wouldn't have saved her she would be dead. Also, they exposed high political officials like Bill Clinton. I guarantee if Mark was her handler that would not happen
