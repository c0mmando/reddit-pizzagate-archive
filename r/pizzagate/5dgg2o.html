    Wouldn't it be feasible to attempt to investigate at one of the neighboring businesses?  Looking at google maps Red fox cafe  (between cosmic and besta) is probably too small, but the Sherwin Williams paint store right next to Prose might be viable.

    I don't really buy into the tunnel theory, but just a thought...

    A child rescued from child trafficing accurately described the tunnels and living quaters of the White House in 1987.

     That sounds fascinating.  Never heard that one.  Can you provide a link?

    I believe there might a tunnel entrance behind the logs in the toilet area of Comet Pizza. See this image: http://archive.is/aiiUE
   </p>
   <p>
    The practice of digging and building seems to be something these people are doing a lot

   </p>
   <p>
    Also the Hawaii lead seems to show underground facilities

   </p>
   <p>
    The stacked wood also seems like a great place to hide a hidden door (which they apparently like building). There might a plan to them building hidden doors to the toilets as well, because if one of the kids start running their mouth about hidden doors in the toilet, no one would bat an eye and they could quickly be silenced. The stacked wood would make it really easy to hide a door, imagine combining these ideas:

   </p>
   <p>
    It would make sense for there to be a hidden underground as well. Not sure if that is the entrance, but it keeps bugging me and I can't get it out of my mind. There surely is a reason for why they bought all the surrounding houses. Very likely to be certain that no one hears them building and using the underground facilities.

    It would be great to have a structural engineer or someone with equivalent skills look at plans (if they are available) of the buildings, as well as the local area, like how good is the ground for building underneath the road for example. Evaluating the feasability of constructing more vast underground structures etc. Perhaps there is only one small additional basement in which children are perhaps held, or it might be a more tunnel like system where different parts are connected.

     Wow awesome.  A lot of info I hadn't previously seen.  I saw the foundation photo many times but hadn't seen any actual proof on its location.  Any word on that first pic (the hole one)?
    </p>
    <p>
     Great info.  I thought I'd read up on most of this and stayed current but this is a ton more info to me

     No right on the other side of the wall behind the woodpile is a big open room.   It's the big room where the ping pong tables are.

      I'm thinking it goes downwards, not through. So you would have to kind of shift them over.
