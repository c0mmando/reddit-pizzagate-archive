    From June 2009 article: 
"The Washington Post's Tom Sietsema reportsthat Carole Greenwood, co-owner/chef of Chevy Chase touchstones Buck's Fishing &amp; Camping and Comet Ping Pong, is no longer involved with the establishments. According to Greenwood's former business partner James Alefantis..."
   </p>
   <p>
    I Looked up the article after reading the comments here:  (http://www.abeldanger.net/2016/11/podestas-pizza-and-pedophiles-baphomet.html?m=1)
   </p>

    Interesting comment:

Washington City Paper did a piece on co-founder of comet and buck's , Carole Greenwood, quitting. There is a comment on the article from "Carole fan" who says they know the story, and it makes them nauseous. They won't ever go to either establishment, and you wouldn't either of you knew. I have a screenshot. The paper scrubbed the comments by the time I returned to try and grab a link and copy the text verbatim. And below the article is a new one about how pizza gate has real consequences for comet.

    Also, did the Washington City Paper update the article and add more?  I don't remember this much detail with names, etc. in the article, so maybe they have written two?

    Also, one of the comments on this article says, "Just ask Peaches Geldof" - did some searching....

    It's funny how all these people who speak out always end up suiciding, huh?
