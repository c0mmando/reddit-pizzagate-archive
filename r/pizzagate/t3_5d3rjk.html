        <strong>Got spooked, now putting it out there</strong>
        <p><p>I'm a former investigative journalist. I've been following and assisting this investigation since the first connections between pizza et al. were made. I've posted a few times on other boards, but never used a VPN or (fwiw) Tor. </p>
<p>During my research I noticed there were highly significant discoveries being made by certain posters (like Swiss anon on 4chan, who probably cracked the ppt's) who never resurfaced, and neither did some of their evidence and extracted pictures, like multiple pictures of Podesta in the car with the weird black symbol on his cheek.</p>
<p>Some strange things happened to my own internet connection lately. Won't go into it. But it got me spooked. Still instead of retreating, I'm going to come here faux-anonymously to point you into some directions you may or may not have found before.</p>
<p>Search 'Dogana' in the wikileaks. It's a chateau hosting a contemporary art museum in Venice. Check its website</p>
<p>Research Eric Knaus, aka The Great Zucchini. 'Famous' and well connected 'magician', friend of Alefantis and Podesta, personally connected to Hillary, even performed for one of the Obama girls at the WH. I think he's the guy next to Podesta in the important 'card game' picture. Incidentally, he also matches, much more closely than Tony Podesta, the 'other' McCann sketch. </p>
<p>Listen to Frank Winstead's video of comet ping pong across the street. And I mean LISTEN. Then check what he said about them, it's on wikipedia</p>
<p>Read James Huckenpahler, artist and friend of Alefantis and Berlin's Dr. Pong, aka Oliver Miller. He made a book about the underground tunnels beneath DC. Contains a vivid description of what may go on in Comet's ' boum boum room'.</p>
<p>These are some things I wasn't going to put out there, because I got scared. That's no way to live. So I will anyway. </p></p>

        <p><p>"Dogana" has 0 hits in the Podesta emails. 0 hits in the Clinton emails. What is the connection to Pizzagate specifically?</p>
<p>Guys, we can't just upvote this stuff because someone claims they're a "former investigative journalist". </p>
<p>@OP, if you're not trolling, please actually link to sources for what you're talking about. </p></p>

        <p><p>You are right. Dogana's website has changed from my last visit a couple of days ago. </p>
<p>Shit happens again..[to my connection, just documenting)</p>
<p>I'm sure I read a JP wikileak with talk of the Dogana (in Venice) and 'Abbazia'. Can't research now because as I said shit happens again....</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm pointing out that there is no way to replicate your claim. Since that can't be done and nothing is demonstrated is your claim useful to the purpose of the subreddit? Everyone needs to keep this in mind. I'm not discounting your experience. </p></p>

        <p><p>Thats just a video with a performance by hermann nitsch. </p>
<p>I know contemporary art is incomprehensible at times to most people but... It's performance art. It's all about creating cathartic experiences, physically provoking experiences... It seems satanic but it's supposed to be a artistic exploration of 'ritual'. Anyway look him up. </p></p>

        <p><p>If indeed you are telling the truth, probably a good time to get a psychological and medical evaluation and give copies to a few people. We are all in danger of experiencing paranoia (which this stuff has a tendency to bring out) but it never hurts to cover your ass.</p>
<p>Also, if you are an experienced investigative journalist, a credible name would add legitimacy to the movement. Its for easy keyboard warriors to request someone risk their career, and possibly life to expose the truth, but in the end its the only way to make a difference. Anons can do the digging, but the movement needs a face that isnt' wearing a Guy Fawkes mask.</p>
<p>Thanks for contributing.</p></p>

        <p><p>Are you sure it's not just a kid being a kid? Kids do tend to scream and yell sometimes even when nothing is wrong. Would be good if someone can slow down the audio and see if they can verify what is being said.</p></p>

        <p><p>Look at 00:40 a couple passing by seems alarmed by the screams ... and seems to look in direction of the restaurant. These should have been pretty loud screams though if we can hear them across 6 lanes of traffic.
EDIT: I may be mistaken, but that child seems to be screaming "help me, help me". This reminds me of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cqmqe/dojo_pizza_raided_1_yr_ago_for_child_sex/">this</a>. Audio needs to be enhanced. That wouldn't be the typical thing a child would scream if upset. I believe this has been covered elsewhere in this sub, can't find the link.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is speculative, but worth considering:</p>
<p>Establishments across the street are very much in questions too. Terasol changed their logo from a heart (very close to the FBI logo.) And if I'm not mistaken there's a Haitian charity there too. We know the Laura Silsby connection by now.</p>
<p>With the camera across the street from Comet, there's a chance that the cries aren't coming from there.</p>
<p>Lots more digging to be done. </p></p>

        <p><p>Holy fuck. "Help me! I'm here!". The voices don't seem very distressed but they are <strong>clearly</strong>, despite the traffic noise, saying that. </p>

        <p><p>Listen to the "quieter" screams in between cries for help. They sound like screams of pain to me...I am guessing the child keeps breaking free to yell for help from some kind of opening.</p>

        <p><p>These French youtubers would never mention the pizzagate. I'm French speaking myself and I can for sure say they won't. They are mainstream guys, have tv shows and one of them already did a vid making fun of conspiracy theorists. </p>
<p>Edit : après si t'as une source plus que ta parole je suis preneur, mais Norman et cyprien ça me paraît un peu gros. </p></p>

        <p><p>I wish I had the link, I'll look for it when I get home. The black symbol tattoos in the car were from a marathon, matched perfectly on the website. Maybe somebody with occult knowledge could shed some light on the symbology, but it could just as well turn out to be a dead end.</p>
<p>ETA: Ragnar Marathon https://www.runragnar.com</p></p>

        <p><p>look at dates of the email with the pics and then search marathon in DC (unless it was somewhere else) with those dates.. should come up. I don't know how to get the dates of those attachments, cause i would do the search myself.</p>
<p>EDIT: never mind, email ID is right there starring me in the face lol.. brb with results if any.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: found logo. belongs to runragnar.com. A reebok sponsored marathon. It's an overnight 24+ hour running relay across the mountains of Utah.</p>
<p>What "Ragnar" means according to website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ragnar was a king and hero of early 9th century Scandinavia. He was a conqueror, a wild man, a leader, fearless and free-spirited.*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing really special here so far. </p></p>

        <p><p>It is a strange symbol, and with no doubt there is symbology behind it. Maybe it's not relevant our investigation, could be a red herring. Matches the logo for the Ragnar Marathon. https://www.runragnar.com</p></p>

        <p><p>They are tridents which do have an occult symbolism but many sports teams use it as a logo as well. Funny when you know what you are looking for half the logos and symbols we see everyday are occult related. </p></p>

        <p><p>In OPs post he talks about a Swiss anon from 4chan who "cracked" the ppts.  I highly doubt someone has had enough time to brute force embedded images out of these.  From what I have seen, if there steganographic images embedded in images from the powerpoints that we have available from Podesta's leaked emails, they are relatively well hidden.  Look at my post history to understand why.</p></p>

        <p><p>Just before the election i wasn't using Tor. My computer would go batshit every time i logged in to reddit. Day after the election it stopped. Computer running easy peasy. a few days later i start reading and posting here, this time on Tor. Tor suddenly won't allow functionality in reddit without scripts. computer goes batshit again.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm half computer illiterate honestly but as far as i understand it, its your computer's ability to receive wireless remote entry that you want to check, not Tor itself.</p></p>

        <p><p>What I have found so far... reaching out to Mr.Winstead for a comment on this might be a good lead, would like to hear everyones thoughts on that (or if it might be comprimising idk)</p>
<p>Is this the book by Huckenpahler you are referring to OP?
https://www.amazon.com/Feature-Length-Painting-monsters-pleasures/dp/B0063FBZZA/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479236063&amp;sr=1-1</p>
<p>Frank Winstead video of Comet Ping Pong... seemed mostly concerned with traffic safety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHXBrEXmowo</p>
<p>Very interesting article though regarding Mr.Winsteads comments on this:
http://dcist.com/2008/06/small_victory_for_comet_ping_pong_a.php</p>
<p>James Huckenpahler's designs for Comet Ping Pong:
https://www.behance.net/gallery/15173789/COMET-PING-PONG</p>
<p>But it wasn't until Commissioner Frank Winstead's interjections that members from both sides became really riled. Winstead, whose stance was already widely known from his investigative YouTube video of Comet's formerly outdoor ping pong table, accused Alefantis of, "trying to turn this area into Adams Morgan with the murders and rapes," and, "filling up his fat wallet." He also made assertions that the restaurant wasn't up to D.C. health codes and directly asked Alefantis if he had ever spit in a customer's food.</p></p>

        <p><p>I feel your fear OP. I spent a large part of my weekend researching this and some other pretty awful, government related topics. I also send screenshots and messages spreading info to those I know through Instagram direct messages. Several time my messages would be deleted a few minutes after sending. A few times I've gone over old messages and there'd be a huge gap of DMs missing. </p>
<p>I posted on fb asking everyone to use peper ballots and fouble check their votes before and after submission to make sure it went through properly. Then I posted links to news stations that were reporting voter fraud and malfunctioning machines. The day after the election my fb and instagram passwords were somehow changed and I had to jump through hoops to get it to work. That plus my phone had zero service, I couldn't call people, access instagram or use my browser even when I was on wifi. but the other apps worked.</p>
<p>Something has been fucking with my internet and electricity. The web goes out randomly and my lights waver in and out </p>
<p>I got calls from a number ending in 666. Could be coincidence but I wasn't going to answer. </p>
<p>There's this odd high pitch vibration in my room. Its nowhere else in the house and I unplugged/removed the battery of everything electric and I can still hear it. Its driving me crazy</p></p>

        <p><p>Out of nowhere today our Internet went crazy and I had to call my isp and re activate our modem. Was digging into pizza gate last night. No more for me. Unsure if related </p></p>

        <p><p>Interesting, last weekend my modem randomly reset itself and I just assumed my cat had done something while I was out (I normally don't leave him inside but he didn't want to go outside that day). I can't say for certain but I tentatively think that was a day after the first time I looked at a /pol/ pizza gate thread (I normally don't visit 4chan)</p></p>

        <p><p>That is really strange. I've never had something like that happen in my life with my personal modem, clients modems had never done that. It wasn't even like it reset to factory defaults changing IP and whatnot. I actually had to call and reactivate it. They already had the MAC address of it and did it quickly. Made sure it was the actual ISP's phone number as well and I wasn't calling a pizzagate watch list hotline.</p></p>

        <p><p>Huckenphaplers soundcloud has some old majestic ape stuff that is extremely strange. Being a musician, I can see it being just creativity, however with all of this, it seems like more than that. There are 3 tracks in particular with majestic ape reading some passages over a beeping noise that grows in volume. One or two of them seemed to be playing binaural patterns underneath majestic ape talking. </p></p>

        <p><p>I'mma get on this, maybe throw it on the github. Huck was the "design guy" behind Hillary_pizza_04.pdf and (I think) the other PDF found avertising the PizzaPAC. He presented fantasy ideas for what to do with the abandoned Dupont Circle underground, and signed off that report/article/thing by thanking Dr. Pong and James Alefantis. </p></p>

        <p><p>...What are you doing, not using Tor? I guess Appelbaum was right about missing this lesson in J school. If you want to be secure and do your work in a safe manner, you NEED Tor. Actually, Tails more specifically. You should really look into these topics to secure your operation security online. If the conspiracy is true, and insiders are in power, they WILL crush anyone who knows not only how to investigate, but publish information. </p>
<p>Seriously there isn't much of an excuse. If you don't want people around you to know you're using Tor, you could use a bridge or any of the other obfuscation tools. Journalists in the middle east use these tools to reach out to the open internet, against their firewalled and monitored connections. You should be doing that too, if you care about your safety. </p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks OP. And you're doing the angels' work here, so don't be scared. Take refuge in the fact that you're in the right, you're one of the good guys. They can intimidate you, but they will not win in the end. In fact, we already have Alefantis on the run saying moronic things to DC papers. It's getting out there. </p></p>

        <p><p>Have any of you fucking morons actually <em>been</em> to Comet Ping Pong?  Of course not, if you had you'd know it was a fucking NEIGHBORHOOD PIZZA PLACE.</p>

<p>Do you know what goes on in this room?   Do you?  Ready for it..... fucking PING PONG and people EATING PIZZA and DRINKING BEER.  Sometimes they even have a BAND or ENTERTAINER!!!!!!  HOLY FUCK!!!!!</p>

<p>I have a better idea, "former investigative journalist."  How about you just go to the goddamn restaurant and see for yourself.</p></p>

<p>The "La Boum Boum Room" isn't located in or near Comet Ping Pong. It's in the basement of the recently closed L'Enfant Cafe.</p></p>

        <p><p>lol... you mean the tiny cafe with glass windows in the middle of one of the busiest intersections in dc?  man, sure seems like a dumb place to run your pedo satan worship ring.  you'd think the globalists would have the resources to choose somewhere a little more discreet...</p>
<p>do you know what pisses me off about this, besides the demonization of good local businesses?  im sure there is actually is this kind of shit going on in dc, but you guys are just totally misguided with this.  all you're doing is distracting from and legitimate investigation into where this kind of shit goes on. fucking stop.</p></p>
