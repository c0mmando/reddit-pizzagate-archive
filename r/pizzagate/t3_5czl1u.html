        <strong>Hey guys, some advice.</strong>
        <p><p>Want to start this off by saying that I do believe that there is something dodgy going on here, there is too much saying that this doesnt at least deserve some clarification.</p>
<p>That being said, when we start accusing every pizza place of being a sex trafficking organisation, or accusing any major company or organisation that happens to be involved with people that we suspect have involvement, or thinking that every single person Podesta has interacted with was 100% in the know about his secret desires it really starts to head us in the wrong direction away from objective, evidence based work.</p>
<p>If we want to be taken seriously, regardless of what evidence we have, we cant keep finding things that simply aren't there. You guys are doing great work, but dont let your fantasies derail you.</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree that we should not post every pizza joint, we should only post ones with known links to Podesta, Soros, Clinton, or people related to them. But we should at least look into everybody with connections with those three.</p></p>

        <p><p>Thank you, Pizza Lobby, we'll try to keep it down, while we bust some of the worst people in our Country. But prehaps this is good advise for over zealous teens? Have any proof of unfairly targeted bussiness, do you?</p></p>

        <p><p>I disagree.  I think all connections should be posted and all connections should be vetted by us users.  It should be on us users to go find the proof instead of asking for the proof.  We are smart enough to know what is a solid lead and what is not.  The truth will come out.  The ability to say "that argument was presented and was debunked" is important when narrowing down the search and combating disinfo.  edit, thanks for the downvote.  We are taken seriously here.  Your curation is not needed</p></p>

        <p><p>I think he's saying dig, but be careful. The last thing we need is even more people thinking were nuts. We want this to be solid. We don't want to spend who know's how long chasing our tail. 
Investigate these people but don't broadcast it until we have enough to at least make people say " That's odd."</p>
<p>We don't need 100 posts about random Piza places because they look suspicious. Look at facts, odd coincidences that don't quiet line up.</p>
<p>I repeat: The last thing we need is people dismissing us because we sound like UFO conspiracy therists.</p></p>

        <p><p>While caution is good - how many of us a month ago would have not laughed at, but openly mocked, any of this? Prior to the podesta wikileaks stuff. This stuff has been around for decades - as anecdotal crap - that has been mocked. We ALL did it with smug superiority, on some scale, in some way.</p>
<p>So while I agree with the sentiment of caution so as not to go too far in any one direction, I also think it's not unreasonable to explore things that might seem 'crazy' - because a month ago all of this seemed crazy and our eyes have been opened. Let those with eyes, let him see. Let him with ears let him hear sort of thing. </p>
<p>Leave no stone unturned here at the outset, is my own opinion. Just as in a brainstorming session you throw nothing out - good bad or otherwise, I think that we don't know what we don't know and it's time to not torpedo something because it 'might' make us look foolish. We are seeing that things aren't what we thought them to be. </p>
<p>Dig deeper. Dig deeper. I say again, dig deeper.</p></p>

        <p><p>I get where you are coming from as this way we wouldent miss anything, right? And I agree with what you are saying that all connections should be looked into. The examples I am on about are not connections, they are presumed connections, or fantasy connections. If we start posting on what we think 'could' be happening in a blue-sky kinda way we will be heading down the wrong path and away from what we are trying to do.</p>
<p>Edit: I also didnt downvote you :)</p></p>
