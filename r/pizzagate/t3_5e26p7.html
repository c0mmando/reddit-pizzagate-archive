        <strong>Kevin Spacey, a guest of the Lolita Express, and his History of Sexual Aggressiveness towards Young Men</strong>
        <p><p>As we all know, Kevin Spacey flew on Jeffrey Epstein's Lolita Express.  While many people may just say "wrong place, wrong time," it's important to remember that Kevin Spacey has a <a href="http://defamer.gawker.com/people-keep-telling-us-about-kevin-spacey-s-aggressive-1686507320">history of aggressively pursuing "barely legal," young men</a>. After reading the stories that Gawker accumulated, you can be the judge if you think he would ever go for someone below the legal age if the opportunity arose.  </p></p>

        <p><p>So just doing a quick search of Spacey's fav restaurants (and it prob nothing) a shop in NY is on the list with a manager that's now in office.</p>

<p>Also him and Bill.

<p>Edit: so after looking up what restaurant (which I found out added a hotel) Bill and Kevin were at I found it's owned by Andr√© Balazs who at one point was dating Chelsea Handler who apparently was in the podesta emails.</p>
<p>Kinda 6 degrees of seperation thing but still interesting. Also in these searches Heather Podesta showed up a lot but I didn't explore that yet.</p>
<p>Edit 2: a search of Heather and Andre turned up this http://www.musicboxfilms.com/marina-abramovic--the-artist-is-present-movies-3.php</p>
<p>So it seems they all run in the same circle.</p></p>
