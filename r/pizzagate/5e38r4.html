    The Dutch DEMMINK-case might offer some more clues
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Since we, the good people of the world, are trying to get our minds around what might be one of the biggest and most important cover-ups of known history, I feel I should point your attention to a case that has been rotting in the Dutch elite-closet for years. It is known in the Netherlands as the "Demmink-case".
   </p>
   <p>
    In short, this case is about a high-ranking official at the Ministry of Justice, a Mr. Joris Demmink. He is connected to several cases of paedophilia and child molestation. Also, many people investigating his case, or who could be incriminating witnesses, are either missing or have died under mysterious circumstances.
   </p>
   <p>
    One very consistent rumor that keeps resurfacing is that Mr. Demmink went to Turkey to have sex with underage boys, and he is now blackmailed by the Turkish government. Specifically, this is why, against all treaties and after very questionable court cases, the Kurdish activist Baybasin is still kept in a prison in the Netherlands.
   </p>
   <p>
    Also, his network extends to the Dutch Royal family. What is particularly interesting here, is the role of Mrs. Mabel Wisse Smit, who is married to prince Friso (who died after a skiing accident not too long ago), but who during her student days was in a love affair with Klaas Bruinsma; one of the most notorious Dutch criminals in recent history, and also involved with pedo networks. Her involvement with this criminal was revealed after she got engaged with prince Friso, and caused quite a stirr in the Netherlands, forcing Friso to abdicate his position as possible heir to the throne.
   </p>
   <p>
    Amongst the people who defended Mabel (because, to the public eye it seemed like she had lied about her "closeness" to Klaas Bruinsma) was a certain
    <em>
     drumroll
    </em>
    George Soros, who Mabel considers a mentor and close personal friend.
   </p>
   <p>
    Most online sources on this case are in Dutch, but here is a good recap in English. I don't know what clues it might offer, but I'm certain this is another corridor in the ever-deepening rabbit-hole.
