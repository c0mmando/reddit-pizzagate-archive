<strong>Artist Found</strong>
<p><p>Posted in an older thread, hope it is alright if I make a new one, in case this could be helpful at all.</p>
<p>I found the artist for the two similar paintings. She is likely a child sexual abuse/trauma survivor with DID, and her artwork is likely part of her processing/expression in her therapy. So please do not harass her or be otherwise disrespectful. Just providing to confirm that this art is about child sexual abuse (although to me that was pretty obvious), and appears that it would have to be specifically sought out based on its content as well. Below are the only hits I got when searching.</p>

<p><p>Allegedly, one of the paintings was a poster shown in the building. The artwork seems to be pretty obscure, so if this were all some elaborate sick hoax, then whoever used that artwork would have had to have known about the psychology behind severe child sexual abuse, known what to search for and somehow stumble upon that artwork. The other possibility, if the art really was featured as a poster in the building, then whoever bought it would have been specifically looking for artwork about ritual child sex abuse, to use as a decoration in a pizza place. Either way it's bizarre. But it appears that the artist herself was a victim, and her art is a form of therapy for herself. That's why I ask that please nobody  do anything disrespectful. </p></p>

<p><p>AMAZING FIND !!! make sure to share this with other subs.</p>
<p>as if the green painting wasnt clear code/disturbing enough - her related art is even more disturbing - obviously they knew what its source was and it's meaning</p>
<p>was the art on the walls of comet or on the instagram?</p></p>

<p><p>I don't know, hopefully someone else can help you out. I stumbled upon the whole thing a bit late, and by that time stuff had been made private / taken down and some was archived. I've read so many different threads by now over the past few days and am so tired, it's kind of all a blur at the moment. </p>
<p>I just remember that it was claimed that the green background painting was used as a poster for one of their events. This art is very obscure with a very straightforward theme, made by a woman who is very likely a survivor of child sexual abuse. I had to find that artist specifically because I am a CSA survivor and I am also a mostly-integrated (thanks to years of therapy) DID system, and I recognized what that painting was portraying as soon as I saw it. Whoever had made it was extremely likely to be a victim, him/herself, because they understand the psychological effects (dissociation). </p>
<p>Interestingly if you translate the page of the 3rd link, it appears to be a group who is also dedicated to exposing pedophile rings in their own European governments, but the post and comments are from August 2014, and it appears that they used the painting as an art piece for the post-article. Her art is also showcased in a post on a site from December 2009. And then there is her actual gallery with just 16 followers.</p>
<p>She was also on Oprah in 2010: http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/art-therapy-and-dissociative-identity-disorder-video</p>
<p>I swear to God if someone is using her art to try to play some sick pedophilia prank on 4chan/reddit I hope they die in a fucking fire. </p></p>

<p><p>I am relieved that these are pictures she made for her therapy, because when I first saw them in the main thread I was truly horrified and thought it was art celebrating this stuff. Beyond horrible though, this is literally the worst thing that humans do.</p></p>
