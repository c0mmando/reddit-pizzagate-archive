<p>Why did the department of Justice not do their job in the first place? We know that WJC spoke to her, either he's got something on her, or she's implicated, too. We're getting closer to evidence of wide-spread trafficking, who better to have protect the queen than someone to knock down the odd pawn from time to time to hide the bigger picture. Plus, she can appear to be very effective at her job by knowing exactly where to look...
All the while she has the power to divert attention and resources far away from the real action.
Email confirming congrats on apponting Lynch from Podesta https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9308
Why did it take her so long to get confirmed? http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/20/loretta-lynch-confirmation_n_7102342.html
It had something to do with a Sex Trafficking Bill... http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/16/republicans-loretta-lynch_n_7075276.html
The Guardian's Headline "Loretta Lynch 'led the nation' on human trafficking despite Republican standoff" https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/21/loretta-lynch-republican-confirmation-attorney-general What did they mean by that?
Cut back to WJC and Loretta's little chat;
Bill Clinton met Loretta on a plane to tell her to shut everything down..

This sounds all too familiar, enter Janet Reno;
http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/08/us/janet-reno-dead.html
Republicans accused her of protecting President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore when, in 1997, she refused to allow an independent counsel to investigate allegations of fund-raising improprieties in the White House.
She also prosecuted an obscure 'satanic' child molester in a high profile case;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-care_sex-abuse_hysteria#Country_Walk
Let's also not forget her handling of the Waco Massacre, in which her 'remedy' for suspected child abuse was to 'gas' the compound. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_siege
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2EqZ4-enx8 - Video of Hicks never more relevant in reflecting on this tragedy.
Notice the similarities in these women..?
The Clinton's keep the AG's close for a reason.</p>
<p>We need to dig harder into Loretta Lynch.</p></p>
