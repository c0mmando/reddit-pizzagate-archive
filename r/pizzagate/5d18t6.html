    absolutely incredible, shocking, sickening. this shines so much light on everything we're talking about.
   </p>
   <p>
    i used to work with a girl and I found out her story. she had been in half a dozen foster homes, and in all of them she suffered the worst type of abuse. I'm talking about being locked in a dog crate and being spanked with a grill brush.
   </p>
   <p>
    her life is an absolute mess, but she has a heart of gold and is doing her very best. she was not taught how to live normally, she was never taught how to take care of herself hygienically.
   </p>
   <p>
    the worst part is that CPS is coming to take her kids away...
   </p>
   <p>
    NOBODY questions CPS. Everyone thinks that the kids are better off out of their houses. But does anybody think about the foster homes these kids grow up in?
   </p>
   <p>
    we need to have a massive movement to get our foster homes audited and checked and independent studies. I MEAN massive. NOBODY TALKS ABOUT THIS

    This reminds me of a scene in "Stranger Things" where the owner of the diner called Child Protective Services when he discovered Eleven. The CPS agent shot him in the head. Funny how this all mirrors reality, only that in this world, things are upside down figuratively.
   </p>
   <p>
    And to add, Bill Clinton was the one who brought the Safe Families &amp; Adoption Act to life. God, save the children from all these abuse...

    BTW, unsurprisingly Nancy Schaefer died under "mysterious circumstances".
