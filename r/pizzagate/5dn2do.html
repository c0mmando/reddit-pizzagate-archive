      Yes, he had sex with dead bodies, but he was also a pedo because he had keys to the children's hospital and would go there at very odd hours of the night.

    Since we are talking about Savile.
   </p>
   <p>
    This connection has always intrigued me although we could never get much info on it

    A picture on his wall of him with 3 NASA astronauts .
   </p>
   <p>
    1 of them speculated to be Lisa Nowark
   </p>
   <p>
    She was the one who went crazy and drove across country wearing an adult diaper and murdered her lover (my memory is a bit hazy but thats the jist)
   </p>
   <p>
    Any of you yanks got any input in to this.

     Holy shit. I did not know about that Lisa Nowark connection.
    </p>
    <p>
     Any further confirmation on this? She could have been trying to escape, but already under mind control.
    </p>
    <p>
     If there, is, this should be it's own thread.

      No press coverage at all ,unsurprisingly,so confirmation is a bit hard to come by.
     </p>
     <p>
      Probably does deserve its own thread,i will get around to doing tomorrow,feel free to do it yourself if you wish.
     </p>
     <p>
      The link turned up in This thread, its over 4000 pages of info on Savile and other elite paedo rings,amazing work by all involved.We should go through it for leads.

      Your guess that she was under mind control is the same as mine,Savile being some sort of MK operative?

       I mean, I'm not suggesting we jump to conclusions, but I do recall the story in the media at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was treated as this crazy thing that no one understood. We have confirmed reports about CIA techniques from 40 years ago - can you imagine how good they are today?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm suggesting maybe there's a possibility she was: drugged, hypnotized, traumatized, or otherwise, which caused her to act erratically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, thanks for the link.
