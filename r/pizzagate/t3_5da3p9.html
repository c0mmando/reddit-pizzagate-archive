        <strong>For the skeptics</strong>
        <p><p>Given the recent influx of anons here I want to set up the chance to start at the beginning and debunk the whole thing if possible. I feel that the beginning of all this is:</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795</p>
<p>This email, apparently from a real estate agent:</p>
<p>Susan &amp; Herb,</p>
<p>I just came from checking the Field house and I have a square cloth handkerchief (white w/ black) that was left on the kitchen island. Happy to send it via the mail if you let me know where I should send it.  I also meant to inquire yesterday about the pillows you purchased. I can send them as well, if you let me know where they are in the house.  </p>
<p>Safe travels to all,
Kate</p>
<hr>
<p>Prompts this email to John Podesta:</p>
<p>Hi John,  </p>
<p>The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want. I know you're busy, so feel free not to respond if it's not yours or you don't want it.  </p>

<p>A handkerchief, with a map, that seems pizza related.</p>
<p>Why does the mention of a black and white handkerchief found on a kitchen island translate into a handkerchief with a map that seems pizza related? </p></p>

        <p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Thats a decent question. Read the exchange again though. John Podesta doesn't even seem present during the tour Kathryn Tate is providing. She references Herb and Susan Sandler, Steve and Patty (both without surnames). She also specifically mentions that they all piled into a car, and that it was a tight. The four guests and the realtor fill up the car leaving no room for John Podesta to be there.</p>
<p>So then why the fuck is John Podestas handkerchief found at a house he didn't tour during the day?</p>
<p>The only logical thing I can think, and it stems from another detail in the emails, is the Sandlers were given an overnight stay in this Field house, since they are from out of town and they purchased some pillows that are mentioned to have been left behind as well. The Sandlers then had some sort of evening gathering which included John Podesta.</p>
<p>Back to your question, why it could be deemed 'pizza-related', thats still a mystery above circumstantial speculation.</p>
<p>There is a lot to this exchange that we are unfortunately missing still.</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree, and that is my reasoning for this post. I see a lot of redditors flipping out and calling this whole thing absurd.</p>
<p>I want to provide a thread to start to debunk this (if possible) and channel energy in a productive way rather than muddying the waters in actual investigative threads. </p>
<p>To me the solution is simple, if this is stupid then debunk it starting with this email. </p></p>

        <p><p>Do we have evidence that it was actually Podesta's handkerchief?  He didn't reply to the email, right?</p>
<p>Do we have evidence that the weird language in the map/pizza email wasn't autocorrect errors?  Seems like a slew of typos.</p>
<p>And do we have evidence that "code talk" exists anywhere outside of 4chan?</p></p>

        <p><p>He did not reply to this to the best of my knowledge, and these are the only two emails that reference the handkerchief. Why would he apparently be the only person questioned about the handkerchief. </p>
<p>Judging by the actual typos existing in the email, I believe it is justified to say the pizza related talk is not auto-correct. If auto-correct was in play yorus would be yours.  </p>
<p>There is plenty of evidence to suggest code exists outside of the chans, a quick google search reveals this. I'm not saying definitely the code words definitely mean what people say they do, I'm just wondering what prompted the change from a black and white handkerchief to a handkerchief with a map in it that seems pizza related. </p></p>

        <p><p>Maybe I'm missing something, but we don't know that he was the only person questioned about the handkerchief, because his is the only email account that was leaked right?  We wouldn't have a way to see other emails that might have been sent to other people about a lost handkerchief</p>
<p>Can you point me to some of the "plenty of evidence" to suggest this code stuff using food words exists, particularly evidence that you think comes from a reliable expert on pedophilia or sex crimes?  I'm just really confused by that logical leap, and confused that this hasn't raised concerns for more people.  But maybe you have seen evidence that I haven't?</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not asserting the handkerchief is podestas, I'm asking why the sudden change in terminology?</p>
<p>4chan is the source of the code word translations, I should have phrased it as being widely accepted and not a fact, but given their checkered history coupled with the fact that the FBI uses the same tactics to identify behaviours and patterns amongst pedophiles ie: interacting with them online, its as good a source as any, but not the point. </p>
<p>The point of this post is to present your evidence to debunk this particular email and by extension pizzagate. We all have questions but no answers and given the amount of coincidences documented in this subreddit we will have more questions before the answers start rolling in </p></p>

        <p><p>I guess the "code talk" thing just seems like the most thinly sourced detail, and also really foundational to the entire theory.  It seems like it would be extremely important to verify that "code talk using food words" exists.  When you say "widely accepted", I guess i would wonder "widely accepted by who?"  By the subscribers to this subreddit?  Or by law enforcement officials with expertise on this topic?</p></p>

        <p><p>In my opinion the code words and what they mean are not as important as why they appear to be speaking in code in the first place. Especially in such an obvious manner as they are in these particular emails, you have the object; a black and white handkerchief becoming a handkerchief with a map that seems pizza related.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well, it seems like the meaning of the "code words" is extremely important, because if your hypothesis is simply that they are talking "in code", they could be talking about literally anything!</p></p>

        <p><p>I dont know but google "handkerchief map" without involving "pizza" and you will see that printing maps on handkerchiefs is definately something that people do. I suspect that this handkerchief was a map of a city with child sex pizza shops indicated so you would know which shops only sold pizza and which shops would indulge your sick urges.</p>
<p>But another part of me wonders if we are reading too much into some of this shit. Like, the Comet Ping Pong shit DOES seem super suspicious, but this shit with the handkerchief could just have maps of genuine local pizza eateries, maybe high Zagat or Michelin rated shops, that maybe some fat pizza lover had printed because he has too much time and money. I mean, some people wear leather belts with holsters for their different favorite hot sauces, which they wear around in case they come across bland food during their daily wanderings. Some people are more into food than others.</p>
<p>We gotta find real evidence and leave our jump to conclusions mat at home.</p></p>

<p>This isn't a detail the realtor provides. At that point in the exchange, the realtor is entirely unaware of Podesta. She never references him and he is never in direct communication with her anywhere in the email chain.</p>
<p>The only detail the realtor provides to the Sandlers is that it is a square handkerchief and 'white w/ black'. </p>
<p>From there, Susan is apparently able to interpret this to mean something related to John Podesta so she emails him and asks if he lost a handkerchief and suggests it has a 'map' on it and may be 'pizza-related'. No where in the conversation with the realtor is any further details given about this handkerchief. In fact, we are faced explicitly with an assumption made by Susan Sandler where she says '<em>it seems</em> pizza-related' rather than relaying what the realtor provided - that it was square and white w/black. Where does she get this inference from? Podesta isn't mentioned as being there by the realtor so where does he fit in to all of this?</p></p>

        <p><p>Why would you use a handkerchief as a map for local pizzerias though when you can just go online nowadays. If you had a map of child sex pizza places, then that would be something you would be forced to only keep a physical copy of, that way it would be destroyable and unhackable. No way would you ever have that shit online.</p></p>

        <p><p>Looking at them on Etsy it seems like the reason that people use map handkerchiefs is because it's like a novelty fashion thing, not because they would actually use them to navigate.</p></p>

        <p><p>Do you think if it was a handkerchief map as google depicts the realtor would have made a clear indication rather than referring to it as a handkerchief (black w/white)? Why are the two descriptions so radically different? </p></p>
