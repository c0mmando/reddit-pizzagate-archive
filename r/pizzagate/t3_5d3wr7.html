        <strong>/pizzagate</strong>
        <p><p>Guys.. my 2 cents. This thread is slowly becoming a board of misinformation. To be a real "Investigation" this board should have been locked down from the beginning. It should have been invite only and only those who are submitting real information either to /r/Conspiracy or to /r/the_donald  or other decent  /r boards should have been invited.</p>
<p>I do not trust many of the Mods.   a few of them have only been redditors for a   few fucking days... (WTF)  - yes.. I know you will say they are scared and using throwaways...  but How do you even know ?? </p>
<p>I may or may not  be creating a private subreddit  to investigate more.. and I probably  would  visit here for some Intel.. but  in no way would I  once consider using this board  to put my facts and theories out there.   it's  just  not locked down the way it should be.  Everything you post on here...  may or  may not be read  exactly by the people you are investigating.  You are telling them  where to hide shit !</p></p>

        <p><p>The biggest problem with this investigation is that there is no end point other than the entire world government structure coming down. We already know they're raping and torturing people in farms underneath Comet Ping Pong. We already know that these Pizza places are actually everywhere now and it's all connected to global elites. </p>
<p>No one can do anything about it because the FBI, CIA, media, academia, pretty much everything is connected to this huge pedophile ring. I think the best thing to do is to just keep raising social awareness until it reaches a critical mass where something has to be done. They've been deleting information and adding disinformation here like crazy, /u/spez is definitely a part of this. This thing is MASSIVE, everything is going to change after this. It goes so much deeper than Comet Ping Pong and Washington DC unfortunately.</p></p>

        <p><p>You are probably right. 2 or 3 days ago this sub was totally fine. All or 90% of posters were digging and posting informations related to podesta e-mails and the mentioned individuals or associates of these individuals.</p>
<p>I even refrained from posting commentaries with clues, because I wasn't aware of the subject. I thought everyone would realize that to post you would to have real information regarding what was or have been digged already. Sadly this isn't the case anymore.</p>
<p>Now there is so much evidence that has nothing to do with those individuals or the leaked e-mails. </p>
<p>There is tinfoil blog posts more than 10yo, auto-generated texts and even MSM completely unrelated material, I mean, the shills instead of putting down the subject, are flooding the sub with unrelated material to a point that you can't tell anymore what this sub is going to be about and increasing the difficulty to link the real diggind. This subreddit maybe be completely overridden by counter-information or counter-intelligence groups. </p>
<p>This sub is dead, it is working only to discredit all the work that have been done until, lets say, last week.</p></p>

        <p><p>Making something like this non public and invite only is making it controllable and easy to silence by removing plausible deniability from participants. Essentially you want the people doing the work to sign their suicide notes. </p></p>

        <p><p>Totally agree, and the quality of the 'investigation' has taken a serious downturn. People are connecting dots that simply don't connect, and they are doxing innocent people in the process. Expect to see a large amount of admin bans handed out in the next few days and maybe even the main sub shut down by Reddit. Would love an invite if you do start your own sub.</p></p>

        <p><p>The people that are getting anywhere in the investigation are people who know steg, and have other useful skills that allow them to gain the information, right now the subreddit is filled with people who just want to make an impact despite not having the skills to find new information. </p>
<p>Most people going on their own leads are way ahead of everyone else, just like it always is with cicada 3301, though in this case, it's mostly about releasing every single bit of info at the same time, enough info to start a revolution. Right now this isn't possible.</p></p>
