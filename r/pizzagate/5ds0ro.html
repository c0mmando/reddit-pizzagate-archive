     My hope is that once Trump won (they weren't expecting this) they got asked to stop publishing so that damaging evidence can be used as a surprise later by FBI to convict.  If there is going to be an official investigation they don't want to ruin it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thats my hope...
My fear is.... well you know that answer :(

       He could be in protective custody right now or of course dead or being tortured....hopefully the former
If he does not show up by January 20 or around then I will change my tune and be a lot more worried

         One of three things... he is either dead... or alive and well but choosing not to contact anybody for some reason... or being held hostage

         I suppose there's a 4th option if you believe in aliens. :)

    If Wikileaks is not compromised, then Assange is deliberately fueling such speculation by refusing to provide evidence of his well-being. It seems more likely that Assange was smuggled out of the embassy a month ago (after being drugged with the food delivered by his friend), and the deadman's switch was disabled with rubberhose cryptanalysis.
   </p>

    The Mccann connection seems like disinformation, but would be easy for authorities to confirm or disprove: all they have to determine is where the Podestas were on 3 May 2007; if not Portugal, it has been debunked.
