     Part of pedo ring? I doubt it, but he's certain to have some shady deals behind his back. He's just much better than Hillary in hiding his tracks.

     Most likely not, but it's not in his interest to uncover this.

    Watch the video, this is not what his aide said. However, I would be convincing them up and down that I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole.

        this is one of your recent comments:
       </p>
       <p>
        "Biblical as in large or epic, but also literally biblical. There are many out there who believe this election has had a divine hand involved. Just YouTube search "Trump chosen by god" and you get hundreds of results.
In my own view, it's biblical because we are about to witness everything we know about society, power, and our leaders be completely brought to light. I believe we are entering a historic human awakening."

        Just leave people alone and go to the doctor. Your parents should be worried sick about you.

        Confirming what? That youre a dumb fuck and should have his face stomped on? stop harassing people /u/FukingWhiteMale you piece of shit. Really original username by the way you are exactly like every other trump troll and think youre one of the cool kids by acting exactly the same as everyone else. What is more lame than being a bully who has to try so hard to fit in like you?

         How are you being harassed? You're the one using the expletives. Do you think not having your feelings hurt is a human right?

         People who confuse revolt with susceptibility are probably educated beyond their intelligence.

    He won't go after her for the email issue and maybe CF/CGI.  He didn't say he wasn't going to go after them for pedo ring.  Which would you pursue if you were LE?

    it's because everyone was calling him a dictator for saying he would hire a special prosecutor. so now instead he is just going to wait for the pedo ring or more clinton foundation stuff to come out. then he can prosecute her without it looking like he was just doing it out of spite.

    Half the people in America still blindly love Hillary... Trump will do better to just let it slide and the let the FBI come out with... "Oh we've been working on this case for years and years... we're gonna be the ones to lock her up."
   </p>
   <p>
    Save Trump from some of the lock her up hate... while still locking her up. Don't want people thinking hes wasting president time on a vendetta.

     I hope it's something like that. I was bothered when I saw that but I hope it just means that someone ELSE will go after her.

    Congress can still do something about it.  I bet they have a ton of dirt on Trump, so he will keep in line like a good lap dog.

    New Jersey pizzeria bans Donald Trump
   </p>
   <p>
    "Hauke says he employs people from many backgrounds, including "Latin American, Mexican, Guatemalan, Vietnam..." and many more. He says he checks for legal status before making any hires but does not care where his workers come from."

    From now until January 20th the media/Trump has free reign as far as I'm concerned to say whatever the hell they want to about what he's going to do. If I see "Donald Trump Says His First Act As President Will Be To Impeach/Fire Himself And His Entire Administration And Hand Things Over To Clinton" I'm filing that away under things that don't need my immediate attention. But after January 20th Trump had better not drop the ball.

    If Trump was going to go after Hillary, he would never announce it. She would probably kill one of his family members.

    Well of course not!
   </p>
   <p>
    We're talking about a politician here. How would it be in his interest to attack Clinton or uncover a possibly (or
    <em>
     very likely
    </em>
    ) strong organisation?
   </p>
   <p>
    Don't you people have secrets? Is there nothing you could be blackmailed with?
   </p>
   <p>
    So does Trump.

     There's literally nothing you could blackmail most normal people with, we're not in positions that create situations that can be used against us. Go ahead and publish the story that I stole some earplugs from Walmart a month ago, lol.
