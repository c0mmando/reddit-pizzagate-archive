<strong>How would you open Wikileaks' insurance files?</strong>
<p><p>I downloaded three "insurance files." And I just <a href="https://twitter.com/blueshrill/status/795895378499366912">saw this on Twitter</a></p>
<p>Let's assume that's "the key" for a moment. What do you do with it? I don't know how to open these files. Thank you.</p></p>

<p><p>Since no one has honestly answered you or everyone that responded doesn't know, ill post how to do it: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Install AesCrypt </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to the AesCrypt folder in your Program Files. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move the 3 files located in this folder to your root C:\ folder. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put the insurance.aes256 into the C:\ root too. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to CMD, (Command Prompt) then enter the directory like this "C:\aescrypt32 insurance.aes256".  Without quotes.  Or you can use any directory that the files are located as long as you do it right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will then prompt for a password.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you enter the right password, it will decrypt.</p></p>

<p><p>Encryption keys that we haven't been given yet. They're supposed to be released upon Assanges death. But.. we'll see. 
Keep them though. </p></p>

<p><p>Three torrent files were released around the same time as this tweet. If this tweet is the key to any of the three files, I just don't know what to do next. Unarchiver doesn't recognize it.</p></p>

<p><p>Anything to do with aes256 but tbh I don't know. I figure l33t hackers will know the keys when they see them. The information in those files are supposedly WW3 material. I wish there was some sort of think tank dedicated to these types of issues.</p></p>

<p><p>I think it's bullshit. Wikileaks hasn't tweeted anything since this morning.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/wikileaks/with_replies</p>
<p>I don't know how to open the files even if that is the key, but that looks like too short a key to me.  </p>
<p>Edit: maybe they were tweeted then deleted. There is a large part of the community that thinks that Wikileaks is compromised, and that Assange is dead or has been captured. It could be that they tweeted it then the government deleted the tweet. Archive that twitter post.</p>

<p><p>Wikileaks is not stupid and relying on only twitter.  They have contingencies.</p></p>

<p><p>We haven't seen proof of life of Assange in over a month. There was an interview recently released that was purportedly from October 30, but many people think it was recorded earlier. He's been in the embassy for 4 years, and it's possible that the government infiltrated the organization and managed to eliminate all the contingencies. It's also possible that the people with the insurance file keys are waiting to be absolutely sure before they release. A 3rd possibility is that Assange is still fine in the embassy and all the people at r/whereisassange are worried for no reason.</p></p>

<p><p>I agree with everything you said.  He could also be held hostage.  That would explain no switch as well.</p></p>

<p><p>Likely the files will be archived (compressed/encrypted), and the key will be requested as soon as you try to extract the file.</p></p>

<p><p>The torrents have been available for download since November 8. Scroll down about 1/5 of the page here

<p><p>So you don't think the cryptic number in the tweet is the keys?</p>
<p>I have 2 things:  1. <a href="http://archive.is/YKu0V">Set of 3 files</a>, 2. <a href="http://archive.is/3bvgi">this tweet</a></p>
<p>It seems logical they should complement each other, but I don't know anything about this encryption thing, so I'm asking for help.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah I didn't download the insurance files at all 'cause I was somewhat worried about my IP being listed as a peer, I don't even know what format they're in. That could be the key. It doesn't look like a typical keyphrase but you can make them anything you want, and chunks of 4 characters are easy to write down/read.</p>
<p>Maybe someone else with the actual files will be able to help more, sorry.</p></p>
