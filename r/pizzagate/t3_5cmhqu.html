<p>This one mentions a miss Kathy Reummler as the member of the DoJ to dismiss the case.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/cGPfGT.png">And here she is</a> on the pre-announcement Clinton campaign strategy team.</p>
<p>Furthermore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_Ruemmler">Ruemmler</a> is a former federal prosecutor who helped lead the governmentâ€™s case against the former executives of Enron. In 2006, she delivered the government's closing argument in the trial of former Enron executives Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling, both of whom were convicted. She returned to Latham in 2007, this time as a partner. <strong>From 2000 to 2001 she served as Associate Counsel to President Clinton</strong>. She was a litigation partner in the Washington, D.C. office of Latham &amp; Watkins from 2007 but left in <strong>January 2009 to serve as principal associate deputy attorney general at the Justice Department</strong>.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In September 2014 when Attorney General Eric Holder announced his intention to step down, Ruemmler was speculated as being a potential candidate as the next United States Attorney General.[15][16] She withdrew from consideration the following month, amid speculation that she would have faced a "difficult confirmation process" because of her close friendship with President Obama.</p>
