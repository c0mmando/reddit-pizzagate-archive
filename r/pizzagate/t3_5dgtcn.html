        <strong>Hi Reddit! We're the z-sec.io team!</strong>
        <p><p>Proof: https://www.z-sec.io/hiReddit.html</p>
<p>We've noticed a good deal of traffic coming from a thread about our company (https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5danwt/it_security_company_created_by_bill_havre), and would love to set the record straight about a few things.</p>
<p>First of all, we have no idea who Bill Havre is. We submitted our LLC documents to our lawyer, who then submitted them to the state—if Bill Havre signed off on the papers in Washington, that's just a coincidence. He has no stake in our company, and we do not have any other branches. The "Zanarkand Limited" that was found in the Panama Papers seems to be a company set up in the UK (https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10355005). We have no affiliation with the company, although we are quite sad that we weren't the only people to think of using Zanarkand (a reference to Final Fantasy) for our company name.</p>
<p>Second, the cipher at the bottom of the website: we're all big fans of puzzles and cryptography and thought it would be fun to add a small puzzle to our site. We got the idea for a pigpen cipher from an Adventure Time comic (http://aaronrandall.com/blog/cracking-the-adventure-time-cipher/), and the whole point is to offer a discount to any new customers who figure it out. The cipher reads "Mention shibboleet to receive a discount on your first bill." Shibboleet is a reference to an XKCD comic (http://xkcd.com/806/), and the filename, "hellofriend.svg," is a reference to Mr. Robot, something else we're huge fans of.</p>
<p>Third, our strange bios. We've updated the site to explain why this is the case, but here's a short explanation: putting personally identifiable information (or PII) on a business website is a bad idea. It can be used for social engineering, which is a great way to gain access to a company. So instead of putting PII on our site, we went with obviously fake bios up to illustrate the idea. This has backfired a bit, but we're hoping the new explanation will help make that clear to future visitors.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to say that while we appreciate the traffic, and we fully support the arrest and conviction of anyone abusing children, we're just a bunch of security nerds trying to get a company off the ground. Our website changed recently because we wanted a more professional look, and we're still trying to figure this whole start-up thing out. If you keep an eye on the site, you’ll notice some more changes over the next few months—we’re hoping to roll out a hacking challenge to illustrate some of the ways a company can be compromised and PII stolen.</p>
<p>Let us know if you have any questions!</p></p>

        <p><p>I'd like to emphasize what /u/archnihilist said. You are seriously the first entity that we have witch hunted that has responded reasonably whatsoever. I understand that accusations of child pedophilia is serious business and its understandable to jump to anger in response, but all we've seen (which the exception of your response) is just name-calling. Thanks for the professionalism.</p></p>

        <p><p>Here's the explanation for shibboleet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Shibboleet" is a portmanteau of "shibboleth" and "leet". A "shibboleth" means any word, custom, or other signifier which is used by members of a group to recognize other members or those who are "in the know" about something. Its use originates in the Hebrew Bible, where the precise pronunciation of this word was used to distinguish Gileadites from Ephramitites. Leet (based on the word "elite") refers to "leet-speak", a practice of character substitution and abbreviation common across the Internet (or "teh 1n73rn3t", as you would say in leet). Thus, "shibboleet" is a shibboleth used to identify someone whose computer-knowledge is "elite." Leet is again in leet written as 1337 so again a reference back to the 1337 comic series including the comic mentioned above with Stallman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(taken from the explanation for the comic: https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/806#Explanation)</p>
<p>So all we're saying is that we're nerds/geeks.</p></p>

        <p><p>You computer language is so leet that you http instead of https. </p>
<p>Still not buying it. Shibboleth is a hidden group or custom.</p>
<p>How was the UK site set up a few months ago, yet you link it to the Panama papers?</p></p>

        <p><p>So what does shibboleth mean to you, pedo? Explain your statement that the UK site was from Panama Papers and not you? How is that so, when you link shows they were created 2 months ago?</p>
<p>Don't fall for this guys. This is a fucking shill. They created the account to post here, created other shill accounts to corroborate their nonsense story. </p></p>

        <p><p>Also a great point of a West Wing episode, where Bartlet is put in the unenviable position of verifying the faith of fearful asylum seekers. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqkaBEWPH18</p>
<p>Also, thanks for doing the decent thing and addressing a concerned community full throttle. I am reminded of another Sorkin show that had become a rehash of all he had written before; Newsroom. They demonise citizen journalism, and justifiably so with the circumstances provided (failed reddit witch hunt of Boston Bombers), but when there is no legitimate and public record of an investigation as potent as this currently, especially considering every circumstance connected to it (almost poetically, spanning back to when Andrew Breitbart broke Wiener's story on O&amp;A) I believe that this investigation is paramount. A worldwide community walking into the fire, ultimately hoping to find nothing, but with the intention of saving others when no one else will touch it is truly spectacular. </p></p>

        <p><p>It's very odd that a company who touts themselves as a "premier security company" would put fake bios like that. No one would take you seriously. This would be more believable to me if you just didn't have the bios at all (Why bother putting bios, and fake bios at that, if you aren't going to list any real information anyways) Seems very strange to me still... but do appreciate you coming out with an explanation. </p></p>

        <p><p>They said everything is "coincidence?" They said the company from panama papers "wasn't them." The creation of the website says 2016, how could that be panama papers?</p>
<p>The whole thing seems suspect. It's all just a "coincidence." Nothing is coincidence in this investigation, we all know that. </p>
<p>If someone were to be involved in a pedo-ring, they would create a whole ton of "plausible deniability" before they even started. They would create explanations for every question before the question was asked.</p>

        <p><p>Wtf broseph. They're referencing an XKCD comic that makes a joke combining "shibboleth" with "leet", which is linked above. As you've pointed out, "shibboleth" means something distinguishing a particular group of people. "Leet" is an Internet hacker slang joke. Therefore, "shibboleet" is a portmanteau of the two words. The joke is that the "geeks" mentioned in the comic are using "shibboleet" as a shibboleth. This company is referencing this comic by using that term. May I suggest you seek psychiatric help?</p></p>

        <p><p>Don't believe them yet, too many questions and "coincidence." </p>
<p>Madeleine McCann in the gematria, "Panama Papers from the UK," their shit site and weird bio hiding their identity, Harve is a "coincidence." It's a line of probable deniability that was created before they set forth. It's all set up to make them look innocent. I'm not yet convinced, stay vigilant. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, but Harve was a "coincidence" they said. Them in the Panama Papers was "another company from the UK" that was created 2 months ago, they said. Their code was a "coincidence" they said. Then dozens of shills show up doing nothing but corroborating their story without any info other than their BS story.</p>
<p>Fuck this company. The fact that they showed up with such a weak backstory is suspect. The shill accounts are more evidence. We're hot on their tails. </p></p>

        <p><p>The script is actually loading fonts from Google--here's the relevant source code from our page:</p>

<p>It's being flagged because we neglected to use https to load the fonts.</p>
<p>We don't have a DC branch--if you take a look at our FCC filing (http://apps.fcc.gov/cgb/form499/499detail.cfm?FilerNum=831666), our address is in Georgia. The DC address is for the person who filed our business application. We don't have anything to do with him, and have no idea who he is.</p>
<p>Our address is a PO Box at a UPS store. We all work remotely, so it didn't make sense to lease any office space. Maybe once we're bigger, we'll be able to get an actual building, but for now it's just the PO Box.</p></p>

        <p><p>Honestly? Because we copied that bit from our old website, which wasn't https. It was a stupid oversight, which just goes to show that security is hard ;-)</p>
<p>Edit: the oversight has been corrected. All pages are now using https to load fonts from Google.</p></p>

<p>1 other note on the google fonts. i noticed you're calling 6 different weights. thats just unnecessary and after a quick glance it doesn't seem like you're using all of them. feel free to drop a few of the weights.  </p></p>

        <p><p>I 100% believe this and understand why you have the goofy fake bios to deter social engineering. This sub is getting hard to stay on board with anymore...when I saw the quite obvious Mr. Robot and FF references is when I quit reading theories about it.

        <p><p>To anyone reading: This is what disinfo looks like.</p>
<p>Classic strawman argument. I never once tried to convince anyone of a conspiracy. But the explanations provided in this thread simply don't check out. </p>
<p>Being skeptical is different from advocating conspiracy. </p>
<p>Don't let people like hobodude34 stop you guys. Keep up the work, there are more of us than there are of them.</p></p>

        <p><p>He thinks I'm some kind of agent too. His paranoia has taken him off the deep end.</p>
<p>He's 'releasing software' to try and track 'disinfo agents'. He seems to think the FBI have nothing better to do than post on reddit and 4chan haha.</p></p>

<p>Fair enough, I guess we'll just have to disagree on this then. I think the explanations smell like horse-shit, but you are entitled to your opinion as well. I'm not down-voting you, or him.</p></p>

        <p><p>First off, the sidebar specifically suggests creating a throwaway account for posting here.  That's why my account is brand new along with many others. </p>
<p>Second, if you think this explanation is full of shit, I'm sure we'd all be open to hearing new evidence if you can find it.  </p>
<p>I even put together this whole summary of the 4chan thread that came up with the theory. https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dgev0/prepare_to_shit_bricks_4chan_anon_finds_a_hidden/</p>
<p>And I for one am pretty satisfied with this explanation.  Like /u/hobodude34 said, we have to be willing to put leads to rest when it's reasonable to do so.  We can't cling to every pie in the sky connection and expect to be taken seriously.  </p>
<p>I'm still wondering why that Madeleine phrase was on the gematria site to begin with.  But I have enough of a mind to acknowledge when a theory is grasping at straws, especially when another far more reasonable explanation exists. </p></p>

        <p><p>That's a bit of a cop out. The fact of the matter is, internet-led investigations like this have the potential to quickly and severely damage the reputations of individuals and businesses. </p>
<p>I'm all about the investigation, but let's not sugarcoat the impact of potential mistakes.</p></p>

        <p><p>So you found this subreddit by backtracking the "traffic" increase you were getting? Security firm, forgets HTTPS....shows how hard security is...decided to use "pigpen" code...
The pigpen cipher (alternately referred to as the masonic cipher, Freemason's cipher, Napoleon cipher, and tic-tac-toe cipher)[2][3] is a geometric simple substitution cipher, which exchanges letters for symbols which are fragments of a grid. The example key shows one way the letters can be assigned to the grid.
And it's all just honky dory...dude, no offense, but this sounds like total bullshit and maybe some of these guys in here are afraid to speak up, but I call bullshit.</p></p>

        <p><p>You nailed it. People should read the whole thread and realize this was set up as a distraction. There is deliberate misdirection throughout, and the narrative starts to break down when you look at it from start to finish. None of us would have ever found this site without the misdirection. They were trying to lead us here. Trace back how this started, and it is obvious: https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5danwt/it_security_company_created_by_bill_havre/</p></p>

        <p><p>It says the website from the UK was created 9/2016, which is around when pizzagate started gaining traction. Is there any way that filing is a dust off of the trail? Why would both of you come up with the same exact name? We've learned coincidence is not by accident, in this investigation.</p>
<p>The thing is that if someone were to be involved in such a pedo ring, they would take certain measures to be able to backtrack on their story, they would create certain fake paths before they embark on their journey, etc. Everything you listed you explained as "coincidence." </p>

        <p><p>I appreciate you trying to help. But you have not explained why the text produced the string about Madeleine McCann. You directed to me another thread, but the thread does not include the word "Madeleine" or anything related (as far as I can tell).</p>
<p>You might not realize this, but 4chan and others decoded a string of text on the website to say: "Missing British Girl Madeleine Mccann Portugal Two Zero Zero Seven" I believe this is referring to a different string than the one producing "Mention shibboleet to receive a discount on your first bill" (but I could be wrong about that).</p>
<p>You can read about the text string here:</p>

        <p><p>Still wondering why they stopped responding once Shibboleth was asked about.</p>
<p>shib·bo·leth
ˈSHibəliTH,-ˌleTH/
noun
noun: shibboleth; plural noun: shibboleths
a custom, principle, or belief distinguishing a particular class or group of people, especially a long-standing one regarded as outmoded or no longer important.
"the party began to break with the shibboleths of the left"</p>
<p>AKA diddling boys. Watch them come up with a stupid explanation for this as well.</p></p>

        <p><p>Sure! Here's an illustration: http://imgur.com/81mCtB1</p>
<p>We used a standard pigpen cipher (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigpen_cipher#/media/File:Pigpen_cipher_key.svg) and then used the unique letters in Zanarkand to key it. From that, you get the code at the bottom of our site.</p></p>

        <p><p>The thing is that it spelled out her name, exactly. How is that possible, along with Harve being a "coincidence," their website having mistakes, etc. </p>
<p>It's all just a coincidence is their answer. I need more evidence to exonerate in my mind.</p></p>

        <p><p>You need to understand how the http://www.gematrix.org/ website works so you can ease your mind. Every phrase that it matches is a phrase that someone else has typed into the website. So the cipher didn't "spell out her name exactly." It equaled 698 in gematria (which is like a=1, b=2 etc.) Which the Mccann phrase also equals, but only because it was typed that way and only because someone searched that EXACT phrase on http://www.gematrix.org/.</p>
<p>Other phrases that equal 698 include "Orgone Bucket Blasters Planted In Historic Sites And Monuments Of Canada," "Dolphins And Whales Bring Tremendous Crystalline Light To The Planet," and "There Is Absolutely Nothing Wrong With Being A Portland Oregon Girl." </p>
<p>But that website only brings up those specific weird phrases because THOSE ARE OTHER PHRASES PEOPLE HAVE SEARCHED ON THAT WEBSITE.</p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks, this is something nobody could explain and puts the whole cipher story to rest for me. I wasn't letting it go because I said to myself <em>there's no fucking way it spelled her name correctly and also had the word 'Portugal', no fucking way</em>... but knowing other people searched those terms and it 'glues' them together makes a lot more sense now. Cheers.</p></p>

        <p><p>I explained this to PatrioticDeplo last night, and yet he continues to act ignorant of gematria.</p>
<p>I'm starting to wonder, given his pattern of calling people shills, is himself the shill. Gematria is the go to way to mock conspiracy theory culture. There's no faster way to make us look crazy than make a big deal about weird Biblical numerology.</p></p>

        <p><p>There's definitely a behavior here lately.</p>
<p>First they came to bird dog us and found us to be informed and victorious and polite.</p>
<p>Now they've come to simply act the way they accuse us of acting.  It's like Jews painting swastikas on things so they can cry victim.  Or Muslim girls making up stories about stolen hijabs or whatever.</p>
<p>Children.  Children everywhere.</p>

<p>Sketchy as hell def seems like a cover up. You're being connected with a possible pedophile ring, you know like one that fucks and kills infants, who the fuck talks like this in that context? </p>

        <p><p>Hey, I was in the 4chan threads trying to get people off the gematria red-herring. Were you folks aware that the pigpen cipher is commonly used by freemasons and is considered a sign of masonic connections? It's also very common <em>outside</em> this context. Just curious.</p>
<p>edit: Also how much do you charge for pentesting? You said none of you are professional web developers, so I'm interested in what your process would be for pentesting a website. Can you properly audit application-level vulnerabilities?</p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>We know that freemasons used the same cipher, but we really just used it because of the Adventure Time reference. (We're nerds ;-)</p>
<p>Edit: We don't advertise prices for pentesting since it's generally a custom quote, but you can submit an inquiry online if you would like a pentest. We do have OSCP-certified pentesters who head every test--and breaking a website is much easier than building one :-p Additionally, auditing custom applications for vulnerabilities isn't something we currently offer.</p></p>

        <p><p>Then unofficially contribute to 4/8chan anonymously. We need people with your groups expertiese assisting this operation. I understand the inability to "officially" contribute but like I said, help in any way you can. Whether it be via scripts or explanation of how one may do x, y, z on something. Every bit helps confirm or debunk leads, and create new leads to pursue. </p>
