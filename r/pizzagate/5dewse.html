   </p>
   <p>
    Before you read, please note,
    <strong>
     I am not attempting to dispute whether or not comet or besta pizza are involved in a child sex slavery ring. I'm simply pointing out that the man in this video is almost certainly an idiot, and this video does nothing but prove that harassing employees at a restaurant will get you removed.
    </strong>
    (also sorry for numbering format problem, can't figure out whats wrong with it.)
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     EDIT: I have yet to finish the besta pizza video. Periscope was being very slow and I can't get the video to play smoothly. From what I understand, it is indeed more suspicious.
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    I'll try to sum up what happens in these videos.
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     Jack approaches Comet Pizza, casually being sexist toward some women on the way to the door. Calls his friend to join him.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    2.They both walk in acting rather odd and start asking about going to the back to play pingpong.
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     <p>
      Girl at the counter has only been there for 3 days so doesn't know much about the games in the back. For some reason Jack finds this suspicious which he talks about in a later video.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      They find out the bathrooms are behind "hidden doors", which he also finds suspicious. (My town has a bar with hidden bathrooms, I'm more inclined to believe its a cute gimmick and not evidence they're having sex with children.)
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      He notices the back room with the black curtain that kids are walking in and out of. Tries to call it a secret room, even though theres zero evidence they are trying to hide what is going on in that back room. More likely a private party or something.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Eventually, he gets asked by an employee why he's streaming the restaurant, and responds by acting defensive and like its a totally normal thing for someone to be live streaming themselves eating pizza.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Employee/manager informs him that they've been receiving death threats, which is entirely believable considering the press they've been getting. He once again finds it suspicious that the employees that are just there waiting tables don't want to be filmed after spending a week receiving death threats from anonymous callers.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      The manager officially says they are denying them service and want them to leave, Jack and George decide to argue about it at which point a police officer is invited to help encourage them.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      They go back to Jacks car, at which point he theorizes that the pizza place was tipped off to their arrival before they got there because "they were on the phones as soon as we showed up." (keeping in mind this is literally a pizza place, I'm sure they are on the phones very regularly.)
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Jack also comments how weird it is that the periscope app was having trouble connecting for him. He continues these claims by telling his audience "this goes much higher up than I thought it did. This is over our heads." (non-exact quote.) Clearly evidence that Comet Pizza is controlling telecommunication so they can only temporarily stop him from streaming his experience in their restaurant. /s
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Jack also comments how weird it was that the police showed up quickly and that "I've never seen cops show up that fast." More likely, a police officer was nearby in what is obviously an active part of town at night.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Jack and George comment on the oddness of children being in a pizza parlor with ping pong and foosball with what was likely a private party for children happening in the back. Apparently, 9 PM is so late as to be suspicious for children to be at a pizza parlor.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Jack and George repeatedly comment on how weird and outrageous it was that they were thrown out of a pizza parlor for obviously recording and attempting to investigate the restaurant in the midst of a massive internet scandal that would seem to indicate said pizza parlor might be a secret child sex trafficking site.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Jack comments on the oddness of the employees using walkie talkies to communicate because "I've been on military missions, and we use walkie talkies because you can talk on different levels." For the record, I've worked in restaurants, having a walkie talkie is a totally normal and easily the most convenient way to communicate with other employees in different parts of the restaurant.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Jack finds it suspicious that the manager said "I hope you can handle the heat" after handing him a jalepeno pizza that Jack ordered.
     </p>
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    So I guess the take away here is that its more believable to think that Comet Pizza is inviting people to exhange and have sex with children WHILE THE RESTAURANT IS OPEN AND SERVING OTHER CUSTOMERS, rather then perhaps there was a private party and they were just obnoxiously "investigating" as "citizen journalists."
   </p>
   <p>
    Another note, businesses have every right, and often every inclination to kick out people that are openly filming the location. I was once kicked out of a kroger and a mexican restaurant while filming a project for high school. I definitely didn't assume they were fucking and selling children because of it.

     Thanks for injecting some rationality here.  I am not convinced there is anything going on here, but definitely think it merits investigation.  On that note, I still think that absolutely nothing would be going on during working hours, and doubt all but a small amount of trusted employees would have close to an idea of what's going on, if there is anything.

      Exactly. You couldn't run a sex ring in an open restaurant for a month without getting caught. It would likely be late at night if there was something going on, and they definitely wouldn't tell 18 year old Billy who's just trying to save for a new PS4 "hey by the way we do this child sex slavery thing on friday nights just a heads up"

       Yeah that is what I think many fail to realize.  Everyone isn't going to be in on it.  At a front, someone who is in the position to be an abuser, almost certainly doesn't have time to mop floors and serve pizza just to keep up appearances.  And in the case of normal employees, no need for them to know anything

      So to be clear, yes you think its more likely they are banging kids right there at 9 PM while other people are in the restaurant? Private parties for kids tend to run later than a regular night out. If there were lots of children there, it was almost certainly a birthday or something, in which case it would be totally normal for kids to stay later and play with their friends. This doesn't seem suspicious.

        Its not. If you've ever worked in any restaurant that is kid friendly, theres nothing suspicious about that. Especially one with ping pong tables and foosball and whatever other games.

         Have a 3 year old, can confirm, especially on weekends he stays up later than normal and we may go get food after 9. I wouldn't say it's a regular thing because it's not something we normally do but it's not entirely out of the ordinary.

      I would disagree with that.  Questionable on the part of the parents? Sure.  Do I keep my kids out that late?  No.  But it is totally common, I have friends that do this.  More often than not, single parents.

      poorly thought out videos like this one will only take away from the value of all this pizzagate research. noone will take this seriously after watching that guy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Telling me to kill myself seems like a pretty inappropriate response to me trying to bring some rationality in here.

       if you dont take it serious anymore after somebodys video, thats your own problem. this dude was being pretty normal, you must be seeing something completely different. 
people like you shaming others from posting is whats taking away from the value of the research. any info is good info.
      </p>
      <p>
       telling you to kill yourself seems pretty appropriate to me still.

    I watched them all.  Over all creepy vibe and saw secret back room behind a black sheet, kids inside with adults, flickering light like candles, and it was 9pm.    Besta was also creepy and he discovered Hillary lives within walking distance?
    <br/>
    also... I would have ordered vegetarian pizza!

    Two thoughts. Find the address from besta wall. Leave a pizza on the ground.
   </p>
   <p>
    Look every where around all locations for a low key upstairs entry.  Possibly in back and with a ladder. seems reasonable that for operational security they have guests go up before ascending down. Sort of like a maze or a haunted house but more scary

        i didn't watch it. its not like there's a confession, probably just some bonehead holding the camera at the wrong angle and wiggling around a lot -- yelling, then getting kicked out for being an ass. am i right?
