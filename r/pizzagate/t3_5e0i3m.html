        <strong>Here is the encrypted client list for We The Pizza! Need help decrypting it</strong>
        <p><p>Backstory, I stole 2GB of highly sensitive pedo data from a pizza restaurant called "We Are Pizza" with the help of a friend from a 3 letter agency (they took their website down 2 hours after my friend who is MIA action made his first post). The place is HIGHLY suspect, please go down the rabbit hole. Anyway, my friend posted as evidence because no one believed him, about 10 photos I stole from the place of children being brutally raped. Reddit deleted the photos. </p>
<p>More importantly, I stole their software  they use for keeping track of their clients, it is a pretty shitty piece of software and I think it phones home to a website to do the actually encryption LMFAO, but I have no experience with PGP and here this week's list of people who are going to be raping and murdering children. Here is the message:</p>

        <p><p>A full hard drive clone includes the OS, and everything on the drive. It will vastly exceed 2 GB.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, but who ever said the 2GB <em>was</em> the cloned data? The first OP only said that he had 2gb of pedo data, not that it was an entire cloned drive. Could've easily just been a subdirectory in the main drive.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I think the OP is likely full of shit, but due to the fishy pattern of communication he's been taking, not his claims. Might not even be related to the first guy for all we know. </p>
<p>The problem is how absurdly lazy the arguments against this are getting. It's like everyone got all emotional and threw logic out the window the second the first post dropped. That's how irrational witch hunts start.</p></p>

        <p><p>The fact that he mentioned a USB stick with 2GB of data, but NOT the fact that he cloned the hard drive is just sketchy as hell.</p>
<p>The point is, he's pretty obviously just making this up as he goes along. But it has been an hour with no response, so who knows. Maybe he really is uploading something. I'm extending him this one, final chance to prove himself.</p></p>

        <p><p>Which is why I said that <em>this</em> OP is probably full of shit. Did you notice that the guy who mentioned the 2GB was <strong>different</strong> from the guy who mentioned the cloned drive?</p>
<p>Nobody's actually heard from the first OP since that initial thread.</p></p>

        <p><p>Only a professional would be able to get away with running it.</p>
<p>You do that with a dedicated box, VM dedicated host and on it's own LAN with one secure gateway. You can make it buffer traffic for you to inspect and optionally permit or deny. Routing it through tor or something is probably a good idea.</p>
<p>What the hacker should really do though, after cloning everything is to squeeze the box for all they can get. If it has a camera or mic, record the users. Check what else is on the network, phones on wireless for example, MAC addresses. Screen record actual use. Even interfere with data to set them up or call the cops on them doing shit in the act.</p></p>

        <p><p>Just sounds like an unexperienced person in terms of IT and hacking. They had an opportunity to walk in there, grab the data and get out. Who knows whether its true, we won't know until we see the client list. But the images they showed and previous file was legit, so stop trying to shut down something that coul dbe a legitimate solid lead. They are obviously going about this wrong and it is suspicious, so we should treat it carefully, but this by no means makes this a fake outright. Just an unexperienced person with some scary, sensitive information about an extremely scary level of corruption.</p></p>

        <p><p>this is so obviously fake.  </p>
<p>They previously said they downloaded 2gb of files to a USB, now they say they 'cloned' an entire hard drive, and then claim they have an (unencrypted?) exe file which was on the desktop (which makes no fucking sense at all), and then to top it off they are asking for a random stranger on reddit to "brute force a PGP pub key".</p>
<p>this is without touching all of the retarded bullshit about "im tired and i need to get drunk, but first ill make a reddit post lol"</p>
<p>This is so retarded on so many levels im worried it might develop retarded sentience and become a retard version of skynet</p></p>

        <p><p>You're doing what we all accuse liberals of, taking stuff out of context and spinning it to fit your opinion. What we know is 1) They have no idea what they are doing and 2) They leaked some legitimate CP. What we don't know is what the source of it was, and whether it legitimately is from wethepizza. Thus we are remaining skeptical, but don't completely write it off as conspiracy, that is how we have been shut down about pizzagate for years.</p>
<p>What made this click for me was thinking back to the time the apparant "fake" ctr discord chatlog involving david brock, mentioning the Seth Rich murder. Right above where they say they they talk about wethepizza. Here: http://puu.sh/spgcW/183c2b5886.jpg</p></p>

        <p><p>What you say you did, and what we know can be two different things</p>
<p>If we cannot verify the client list (w/o the other half of the key) how are we ever to know you're telling the truth? I want to believe you, because this all seems very suspicious, but at the moment your biggest lead was a dead end (If what I'm being told by /pol and everyone else is true, that we cannot get into the file due to pgp) </p></p>

        <p><p>Plus, that's a pretty small client list, provided it is one. We're talking about encryption here, not compression. We can still get a rough idea of the length of the plaintext by looking at the encrypted message. This is quite short.</p></p>

        <p><p>You are posting an encrypted message without the private key??? Are you retarded? There is no such thing as brute forcing this. It would take 100 years. Do you have anything besides encrypted files. If not, everything you have is absolutely useless. </p></p>

        <p><p>I mean he has the videos of the children being brutally tortured, this was a customer list which would make sense to have a basic level of encryption like this. No need to call him retarded when he explicitly states that he has no experience with PGP. </p>
<p>According to their previous posts the usb drive with the information wasn't even obtained through hacking, which would explain their lack of PGP knowlege. Anyways just speculating, not sure why a post calling OP retarded gets tons of upvotes immediately. I honestly don't see what kind of motivation OP would have for making this stuff up, aside from some crazy honeypot effort which I don't think they'd go about in this way.</p></p>

        <p><ul>
<li>
<p>He posted pics of CP, doesn't mean he obtained them from the pizza place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guy #1 said that he had seen the names and the price list, and now suddenly everything is encrypted ? That doesn't make any sense</p>
</li>
</ul></p>

        <p><p>I know they could be from anywhere, just what would be the endgame to that? Anyways I'll be honest I have no clue where the fuck this is heading, they just made a new post https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e0njl/monthly_client_listexe_is_leaking_the_private_key/ which I have no idea what to make of lol, at this point I'm gonna just sit back and watch. Been following this pizza shit for a few weeks and it really starts getting to your head.</p></p>

        <p><p>I swear, it's like everyone's emotions have just been on high alert today. Everyone's been so damn quick to raise pitchforks and cry BS, that they throw their investigative logic and composure out the window instead of trying to propose alternate solutions.</p>
<p>Here's an idea, how about we ask OP what other possible connecting evidence he has instead of just shitting on this one bit that he admitted to not knowing about? Perhaps they took screenshots of the site's backend at least or something?</p></p>

        <p><p>The guy posted actual cp images. Regardless of where he got them from, if he has that, are you really betting on him <em>not</em> having access to videos to go along with those? Please.</p>
<p>Either way, releasing more cp isn't going to help his case anyway, cause it's the connection to the pizza place that matters.</p></p>

        <p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Please don't jump on me, I have real questions and thought you might take the time to answer them. Right now, re: We the Pizza, I don't know what to think in light of actual child porn appearing and their site being down. It seems like either this is legit or a fucked up person is messing with everyone, right?</p>
<p>So I am wondering what kind of proof <em>could</em> someone provide that this came from the pizza website and not the darkweb? And also speculation on why pedophiles would put this directly on their front-facing business website? Wouldn't it make more sense to keep it as far away from public use as possible?</p>
<p>Not trying to discredit--really asking.</p></p>

        <p><p>The story so far is.... Blurred.</p>
<p>Originally the first guy claimed they hacked it from the website. However, guy #2 says that was disinformation to throw people off, and claims that his friend in a three letter agency has helped him to walk into the pizza joint and copy a harddrive containing the images/videos and a client list (apparently). </p>
<p>The reason this is gaining ANY traction at all is becuase the website for wethepizza went down literally 20-40 minutes after the first guy's post. Almost as if it were a reaction to said post...But that remains to be confirmed. </p>
<p>The real issue here is like you said, proof of the correlation between the images/videos and the pizza place where they supposedly lifted it from. How they will provide that information remains to be said</p>
<p>If you'd like to read some of the things I'm talking about I suggest visiting these: </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dzwji/hi_i_am_the_guy_guy_2_that_hacked_wethepizzacom/</p>
<p>http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/99483242 (4chan thread about this topic, can be...hard to read becuase of all the dumbass trolls on 4chan, check this last if you are bored) </p>
<p>I reccomend visiting this thread: People laid it out here pretty good (as the situation was developing, this thread was made about the first guy, and might still have a link to the original guy's thread) </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dzgif/about_the_2_gb_cp_hacker_i_dont_know_who_to/</p>
<p>At this point: Without a way to confirm whatever was encrypted, we have exactly zero confirmed evidence of the pizza place being implicated with the original pictures that the first guy uploaded, or the supposed other files that (might) exist. </p>
<p>I cannot confirm whether the first images were actually CP, but from what other comments have said in various threads.....To put it lightly...It was brutal torture and rape. </p></p>

        <p><p>Thank you! I've read it all, and while I don't know much about the technical aspects at play here, I guess I was wondering if there were some standard sort of proof--someone mentioned screenshots, I guess?</p>
<p>And also just a general discussion on whether we think a pedophile ring would keep damning evidence on a front-facing website. The website going down definitely caught my attention, too. But it's also hard for me to believe that's where they would keep the evidence, though maybe there are reasons I'm not aware of.</p>
<p>Either way, the fact that this person truly posted CP makes this all so important to figure out--whether they are honest or just messed up people who are trolling.</p></p>

        </p>

        <p><p>So like I said, (If the second guy is to be believed) they did not put the images/files on the website, but had them stored on a harddrive at the pizza place. I assume after the first post, the back end of the website took it down becuase they (! Im speculating here) thought that someone had somehow gotten ahold of the files via the website. So , the website comes down, however that is not how they got the files (according to guy#2), which highlights the sketchiness of the whole situation because a seemingly independent website went down JUST as someone reveals this information, and like you said, REAL cp  was posted(Supposedly, I did not view these pics...I'd never click that shit) </p>
<p>As of right now, guy #2 is actively posting, but many users are very skeptical. You can read his posts on his page: I am actively following the situation as best I can. Big revelations if it's all true. </p>

        <p><p>Okay, so you're saying this second person's account doesn't correlate with a reason for the website being down, but we also don't have verification that person 2 is related to person 1, or that <em>either</em> are legit. Or maybe 1 is but not 2.</p>
<p>Would there be a way to prove that the hard drive was from the pizza place? I also have that tab open and am following.</p></p>

        <p><p>You're correct in that we cannot know either account is real. The first guy did mention a second partner that they're working with. So yea. It could be</p>
<p>A. They're both fake accounts and are leading the entire sub on a massive waste of time.  (at this point, i believe most people think option A)</p>
<p>B. One is real, and the other is not (whether it be guy 1 is real and guy 2 is fake, or vice versa) (this seems unlikely, but entirely possible) </p>
<p>or C. They're both real and telling the truth and we will find out very soon that its all true. (Doubtful, yet, extremely scary if this case)</p>
<p>The website (wethepizza) originally went down roughly 15-30 mins after the first post from guy #1 (where in, he claimed that he or someone got into their website and found the images/files of rape/torture etc). I watched that happen in real time, and yes the site was working fine and then suddenly went into its current state. </p>
<p>Someone on 4chan also posted a link to wethepizza with an admin login page, however obviously it does not go anywhere unless you have the credentials to log in. I believe that to be a cold trail anyway and the only hope we really have is if guy #2 somehow posts ACTUAL damning evidence which somehow proves correlation between pizza place and CP, OR, can prove that the photos were taken in people's houses (He stated the photos are geotagged for blackmail purposes? Who knows if true or bullshit). </p>
<p>So ye. Idk, At this point I'm really skeptical. </p></p>

        <p><p>website is up so it was just "slashdotted", I browsed their site too</p>
<p>the rest sounds like larping, except for the part where he allegedly got his hands on images that can land him on jail if the fbi wants to do their job, be careful with your larping people dont end up on the news ;)</p>
<p>Having said that, if hes for real all he has to do is release the data, all of it, that exe for instance (obv. do not execute it..., load it on an editor to analyze), if it was a honeypot then its obv a trojan. If its for real then it would find files/data ELSEWHERE and process them, outputting the monthly client list. So copying just it is sorta dumb, should analyze to find what files/data sources it tries to obtain.</p></p>

        <p><p>If it's absolutely no trouble at all, you could just casually swing by and check to verify the name of the WiFi network the first guy posted. I mean, they could have taken it down/renamed it, or 1st guy might have been making it up. But if it turned out to be a match, that would lend the tiniest bit of evidence to a story that desperately needs it.</p>

        <p><p>Very easy, they would need to have phished their admin password (An educated guess: their username was admin@wethepizza.com)</p>
<p>After that, they would just need to upload a pre-made error page to the index.</p>
<p>This could all be easily done by anyone who knows anything about web design.</p>
<p>What you have to ask yourself now is:
Why?</p>
<p>Think about how much effort would have gone into this, then think about the mind of a troll, whilst it's not unbelievable, as we know there are committed trolls, it's improbable:
Why?</p>
<p>No troll would openly distribute child pornography on a subreddit that's drawing as much attention as this. It just makes no sense, especially when no internet protection is foolproof when you hack a server.
Why would someone risk being caught, then registered as a sex offender for the rest of their life?</p></p>

        <p><p>The 'client list' is useless, but apparently they have CP and claim they got it from WTP. Videos of rape, some with the abusers face in apparently. And geo-tagged images of child abuse, with the geo info believed to be the houses of clients, for use as blackmail. It would make sense and would be big if all true. Not sure what the best next move is here though. Uploading and sharing the CP seems like a crappy idea. </p>
<p>Perhaps OP should securely upload it to multiple places, then email a summary of what they've found to multiple police departments across the US, and possibly abroad too. Include links to the securely uploaded data and explain that the passwords will be sent separately, and proof of the email has been made available to the public. Send different departments links to the data from different hosting areas for contingency/protection.</p></p>

        <p><p>Or to be precise: one that's encrypted to proper key. If it was using symmetric encryption it would be possible (and only if they used eg. "password" password). </p>
<p>They use some openpgpjs which is almost certainly bad implementation, due to lack of proper entropy source for example, but unless someone knows a VERY serious vulnerability in the implementation (eg. IV set to 000's for all messages) its impossible to break anyways.</p></p>

        <p><p>Why not post the client list and the price list you supposedly found? you're not making any sense here. and now you ran a program in a virtual machine and all it does is return a PGP encrypted message?
Either post the client list and price list and all the other stuff you found, even the program that returns a PGP encrypted message. or you are basically confirming you are full of shit.</p></p>

        <p><p>That is the PGP message. We either need the private key to decrypt it (or someone to bruteforce the passphrase). I am 100% certain within that PGP message is this month's clients list. </p>
<p>Let's ask these guys for help:

        <p><p>It's not a list, it's far too short. In fact encrypting a word "test" yields a pgp message that has 886 characters. Your message has 744. </p>
<p>If I encrypt some fake list, for example</p>
<pre><code>1,e2b2ba@gmail.com
2,b4b8b4@gmail.com
3,0e676c@gmail.com
4,93d625@gmail.com
5,14d725@gmail.com
6,7e8575@gmail.com
7,0a4f46@gmail.com
8,e9f9d0@gmail.com
9,d22e06@gmail.com
10,6d7ac3@gmail.com
11,aea8b5@gmail.com
12,c5babf@gmail.com
13,112d55@gmail.com
14,32adcf@gmail.com
15,426ed9@gmail.com
16,0927b5@gmail.com
17,dd1253@gmail.com
18,1029f6@gmail.com
19,0af69d@gmail.com
20,f850de@gmail.com
</code></pre>
<p>that list would yield a PGP message that is 1113 chars long. And from this point it will only grow in size.</p></p>

        <p><p>I just encrypted your list in GPA and it came to 722 characters.</p>
<p>"test" creates a 522 character long message.</p>
<p>This might vary based on platform to some degree, but if my tests aren't erroneous somehow, it would indicate that there MIGHT be some data of substance in the message. Of course, actually decoding it is impossible so this is all for naught.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think I figured out the discrepancy, I was just encrypting it against a public key and was not signing it with my own private key as well. Signing the message brings the character count to 1196. </p>
<p>A distribution model like this would involve the communications being signed most likely, as opposed to re-encrypting the message against a number of recipients public keys. So yeah, unless they're doing it really weird you totally got a point.</p></p>

        <p><p>"unencrypted the private key" is a nonsense sentence from a technical perspective. </p>
<p>the only thing giving guy1 credibility was that WTP website went down after he came public. you havent even proven any connection to guy1 and the technical shit you're spewing out is completely wrong/nonsensical. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yea I was skeptical to begin with, now even moreso. Sounds more like he is trying to rope people back in by a magic discovery. But I hope I'm wrong and that he posts something real (the encrypted file, or the .exe even). Something we can get to work with.</p></p>

        <p><p>Funny that with no pgp experience he's claiming to have "unencrypted the private key" which makes no sense because private keys will be stored as is depending on what pgp client is used (exported as plaintext). </p></p>

        <p><p>100% done with you. I was a big believer at the beginning of the day, and I'm a sucker.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, your friend supposedly hacked the WiFi network.</li>
<li>Then, it was actually you who got a tip from an intelligence agency, and social kung-fooed your way into getting a 2 GB USB stick with  proof on it.</li>
<li>Then, you have a "client list" which is actually just a tiny block of forever encrypted nothing.</li>
<li>Then, you actually cloned their hard drives (which would OBVIOUSLY require more than 2GB of memory)</li>
<li>Now, you've found out "where it's sending" (UNENCRYPTED THE PRIVATE KEY!)</li>
<li>And for some reason, you won't share any of this. Not the key, not "where it's sending", not a screenshot of the cloned machine, not a torrent of the image, nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>You're a troll, and you're dragging this out for lulz. Shame on you for using a fictitious, morbid story to manipulate a genuinely concerned community.</p></p>

        <p><p>Dude stop. You have no idea how encryption works. You don't "brute force" encryption. Either you have the private key or everything is useless. Answer this: how do you know what is in these files if they are encrypted? Post proof of that or else you are wasting everyone's time. </p></p>

        <p><p>You do realize that different passphrases generate different files right?</p>
<p>That's the idea of a key-pair encryption. </p>
<p>You can't just expect to "hack" it to an unecrypted state if you can't confirm later that the state is indeed true.</p>
<p>Cracked passphrase "onepass" could give info on "Cheryl"</p>
<p>Cracked passphrase "anotherpass" could give, on the same bits, info on "Rotteo"</p>
<p>This is, it is unhackable so to say.</p>
<h2><strong>EDIT:</strong></h2>
<p>To further explain for those non-tech savvy, there is not such a thing as <strong>"DING DING DING": File cracked</strong> because <strong>the computer has no idea what you are looking for.</strong> </p>
<p>You could input password "inr3q3o2" and the computer would tell you </p>
<p>"with that I got <em>Dogebrnaamentifmen</em> for line 22 of the file" </p>
<p>or you could input password "akfmaemfnaE22" and the computer would tell you </p>
<p>with that I got <em>Bill Clinton</em> for line 22 of the file"</p>
<p>But the computer <strong>does not know what you want to have or what makes sense</strong>.  The only "impossibility" for this would be to have a computer analyse every possible file unecrypted for every possible password <strong>with the computer knowing what you want to look at</strong>.</p>
<p>You will have to wait for quantum computing for such a thing.</p></p>

        <p><p>Actually gpg WILL tell you if you got proper passphrase or not. Some checksum I suppose.</p>
<p>In this case, it will tell you about missing secret key and thats about it.</p></p>

        <p><p>It would, considering the file is only under a layer of encryption... Otherwise the checksum will have false positives.</p>
<p>Anyway, bruteforcing this is pretty impossible but OP found a workaround apparently</p></p>

        <p><p>No, gpg will always tell you if the password is correct or not. I do not care enough to find the exact technical data on how it assures that, but finding collision would be likely as hard as actually cracking the decryption.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, take this message:</p>
<pre><code>-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
jA0ECQMCY3bcehzzQCPh0lYBBsMtbShvnivFl0+6mciBgXNnIrYQcs1CXBwgbGC3
QhQKGdLqHz50cbkd2bo7RmXpeGE3gSvvddShIi/WcowRa+xXun/Q9aijx+u1s8xs
hFRg8bRJ0g==
=H8oS
-----END PGP MESSAGE-----
</code></pre>
<p>Try decrypting it (gpg -d message.asc) with various passwords. Then try "hello" as a password.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter what's inside. Can be binary, can be another decrypted file. You will know if it's good or not.</p></p>

<p>"[T]hat's a pretty small client list, provided it is one. We're talking about encryption here, not compression. We can still get a rough idea of the length of the plaintext by looking at the encrypted message. This is quite short."</p></p>

        <p><p>it wouldn't be on reddit, like it or not this whole site is censoring anything they don't like so all the best people who want to discuss controversial topics have moved elsewhere.  This isn't something some nerd can just decrypt by the way.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well, technically you could get the luck of gods and just land on the private key right away. </p>
<p>Typical 8192 bits key
2 ^ (8192) = 109,074,813,561,941,592,946,298,...,997,186,505,665,475,715,792,896 (2,467 digits)</p>
<p>That's how many combinations there are. It would easily take the heat death of the universe using every computer on the planet to not even process 1% of the number of combinations.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is utter bullshit. This isn't even a honeypot, it's childish trolling.</p>
<p>First they "stole 2GB of data".</p>
<p>Then the webserver went down - what does it have to do with the "windows xp" at the pizza place? The webserver is in Texas. This could be completely coincidental.</p>
<p>Now they are talking of an "exe" with the client list.</p>
<p>Nothing makes sense here. </p></p>

        <p><p>UPDATE</p>
<p>The level of incompetence in this "hack" is extremely concerning. I am not sure what OP was trying to accomplish, but without the private key this is useless</p>
<p>Please provide all of the data/files/html as evidence to MULTIPLE PDs (local or otherwise including the NYPD) before posting on the internet. You need to protect yourself, and establish a chain of evidence. Contacting an attorney is also very critical. If you do not have an attorney, get one asap.</p>
<p>If you do provide "evidence" on the web do it in an encrypted dump in bittorrent, all users should be careful and protect themselves, this could be a honeypot</p>
<p>No one cry wolf without validating OP's "evidence". Bringing false leads to the authorities is a surefire way to lose all credibility for this sub.</p>
<p>edit: Other users have pointed out, with good reason that local PD alone may be complicit and may not be the course of action. Simply linking on the internet is not how you bust these people though. You need to get as many eyes on the evidence as possible and make sure they understand you want to establish a chain of evidence and that your life is in danger.</p>
<p>edit2: added request for encrypted bittorrent dump, and piece about false reporting to authorities</p>
<p>edit3: contact attorney</p></p>

        <p><p>No idea. However, if he's not their plant sent to intentionally discredit this sub, he'll pay for it because spreading CP is illegal. The only one that's going to get trolled is him :)</p></p>
