    Children's Hospital Las Angeles :(

    I was thinking about other big families and 
looking into their ties, this goes deeper 
than Paris Hilton... but this is how I found a possible
pedo link.

   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Hilton is listed on the "First Families" of 
the Children's Hospital Los Angeles, which 
means she has donated US$100,000 or more to 
the hospital.[289] In 2008, a room at the 
CHLA was named in her honor.
