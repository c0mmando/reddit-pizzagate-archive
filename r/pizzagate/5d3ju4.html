    Ok, don't scream shill or anything just hear me out.
I'm just new here and trying to make sense of all this. My approach to that is trying to debunk the evidence presented and to see if it holds up.

    The mail is kinda fishy, but it could be anything. No code, the code you guys seem to think it is, and any other code.

    I know of cp = cheese pizza = child porn, but is there anything other than a chan screencap that says map=semen? That's not really 'verifiable evidence'.

    To summarize I've spent about 2 hours on this and all that I have verified is there's 1 weird email and a pizzaria kinda with a childfucker symbol. :-/

    <p>
     And in the meantime, there are now tons of pictures of toddlers online next to their full names, and often next to text describing them as victims of pedophilia or directly accusing their parents of pedophilia.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most people here aren't willing to even consider that they're wrong. But I hope even a few people stop and think.
    </p>
    <p>
     To those taking up this crusade: By spreading those accusations and
     <em>
      pictures of children
     </em>
     aren't you making it worse, even if you're right? And if you
     <em>
      are wrong
     </em>
     , you have just caused damage to children. What happens when this becomes the first thing that comes up when you google their names?
    </p>
    <p>
     You've seen photos showing these children with their parents, whom you have also proven to be business partners and friends of James Alefantis. You've seen pictures of these children at different ages, looking happy and healthy. (This is all in this very sub.)
    </p>
    <p>
     And none of that suggests to you that you
     <em>
      might
     </em>
     be wrong? Not even a chance??? You're
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     certain that you're willing to plaster their pictures and really damaging accusations all over the internet?

      Hey it's you again, I replied to one of your other comments. You seem like you are trying to do good for these kids. A lot of people on this sub are trying to do the same, I believe you may be looking only at the evidence that supports the idea that this whole shebang has no basis in reality. I admit, of course, that many people on the sub are doing the exact same thing on the opposite side. But there will be idiots everywhere, and there are many on this sub. This is certainly a bad thing.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, "posting pictures of toddlers online" with accusations of heinous activity etc; the ppl on this sub are not the ones who posted these pictures. They did. We are simply compiling evidence (to hopefully save victims of all of this, if it is true).
     </p>
     <p>
      Wikileaks has a 100% validity for their records. They are the
      <em>
       only
      </em>
      ones out of any group of people
      <em>
       in the world
      </em>
      who know for sure, with certainty, without question, what
      <em>
       is
      </em>
      true and what is
      <em>
       not
      </em>
      true. The "smoking gun", so to speak, for me, was a tweet from Wikileaks about these exact accusations (I don't want to use specific terminology to avoid being possibly flagged so excuse me, but you get what I mean) against the organization being spoken of.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you would like a link to said tweet, I can happily comply. I commend you for your effort in trying to do Good. Please understand that many on this sub are trying to do the same. I encourage your further skepticism to idiots on this sub making idiotic claims as well.

       Yes people post pics of kids.  You are posting them in the context of a pedo ring.  That is absolutely not the same thing.

       Hopefully you guys don't do the same damage as you did on the Boston Bomber "investigation."

         Copy/pasting another comment of mine; to be clear, I am not "them", I am a lurker who sees the utility of what's going on here. I have no dog in the race.
        </p>
        <p>
         So if we cannot objectively verify these claims of astroturfing (because that is the nature of the phenomenon), how do we know what is true? We don't. But we also don't know what is "not-true". Occam's Razor says that "it's probably nothing" is probably correct. But, because of the stakes here, "probably" is not good enough. That's why a lot of the people here are so "conspiratorial" so to speak; lives could be at stake. So you're probably right, but your probability is not certainty. I hope I am making sense to you.
        </p>
        <p>
         EDIT: Upon viewing the recent activity on this sub, I see more clearly the point you are making. People are blowing this up like retards and probably implicating innocent people. Idiots. The initial claims are still valid, but the targeting of individuals is irredeemable and retarded. I concede.

          Hey, I have to thank you again for your rational conversation.
         </p>
         <p>
          Yeah, you're right--people shouldn't ignore red flags or signals because they're 'probably nothing.' I personally believe a lot of these red flags aren't red flags at all, but like you say, the real problem is not a quiet investigation, it's that people are arriving at adamant conclusions off of circumstantial or misunderstood evidence and using that to overtly harass people and spread kids' pics.

         I agree that there are normal usages of "L'enfant" based on the famous DC figure. But with all of this together - with it literally translating in French to "I love kids" - coming from a Ping Pong establishment with a child love logo titled "Play Eat Drink" (PED) - with insanely inappropriate pictures of kids taped to tables, infants eating pizza way too young, kids nibbling on foreign currency - there's nothing strange about it?
        </p>
        <p>
         Other high-profile pedos have talked about this "hidden in plain sight" strategy. It's as brilliant as it is twisted.

          As a casual observer to all this, there is nothing remotely explicit about that logo (or the Politics &amp; Prose one - literally nothing in it). It's two paddles crossed. Crossing two sporting implements in a logo is quite possibly the most common thing in all of logodom. There is only a very faint, geometric weight sort of similarity between the two logos. If that makes it a secret pedophile symbol, then literally 50% of all tennis and shooting clubs must be pedo rings...

         <p>
          I'm currently in the "10% chance this is real, and I'm bored so I'll keep up with it" boat, and claims like what you made here aren't convincing anyone but the choir, and everyone else is going to have my sort of reaction which is, "you guys are grasping at straws, this is bs." If you don't have
          <em>
           GOOD
          </em>
          evidence, scrap it. This whole investigation you're doing is going to burn out soon if you throw everything and the kitchen sink at the wall and see what sticks... everyone's just going to see random ramblings and dismiss it, and if that's all you got they
          <em>
           should

          dismiss it.

          It's a standard occult practice also. The whole point is because 99% of people don't know the symbols, there's little point in hiding them.
         </p>
         <p>
          With pedos, I guess, it's just a good way to advertise and find likeminded fuckers. But if the symbol isn't fairly obvious (unlike this paddle logo) no one's going to recognize it or it's going to be too vague for them to take a risk on it.
         </p>
         <p>
          Edit: I'm not trying to undermine the sub or whatever, but if you guys don't apply at least a modicum of skepticism to your own claims, or cast a bit of doubt on what you're believing, you're going to exhaust yourselves and the patience of the lurkers with dead ends, mild coincidences, and are going to build up a house on a foundation of sand.
         </p>
         <p>
          The P&amp;P store being a prime example, how many hours do you suppose people have wasted looking into that over the fact its ampersand looks slightly like maybe a pedo symbol, but really just a fancy ampersand?

           I questioned the "every spiral means pedo!!" line too.
          </p>
          <p>
           Then i kept digging.  Lots and lots of busted pedos with crappy, not triangle or heart, spirals all over their shit.  These pedos ARE that stupid.  And that obsessed with their own pedophilia.

            I check into this sub occasionally, usually looking for "comprehensive evidence" posts like OP's. OP's this time was very unconvincing. If what you say is true, you have to prove it to people. I don't believe it just because someone said it. The whole point of these posts is to convince casuals like myself.
           </p>
           <p>
            And I'm telling you it's failing very badly. I know there's a lot of circumstantial evidence that's not included in this post too. It's pretty crap. Up your game or you're going to lose your game.

          As long as there is another explanation, THERE IS another explanation. So you're still firm in that that photo, that's probably not even of one of the accused, with a shirt that has possibly completely inoccent meaning, is VERIFIABLE EVIDENCE?
Is there ANYTHING, that's not just 'Look, isn't it weird...'

           Everything here is verifiable in the sense that you can go out and find it yourself. All of the key pieces about Podesta and the Clintons are based on real sources.
          </p>
          <p>
           The weakest point here is relying on 4chan for the decoder terms, however, "pizza" has been established in pedo circles as a common term for child pornography.

          </p>
          <p>
           And you're right, the t-shirt is apparently not Alefontis, but this idea of "hiding in plain sight" has been a mantra of high-profile pedo busts for years. It's the combination of evidence that points to something strange.
          </p>
          <p>
           I'm not saying this is 100% air tight, but it's enough strange coincidence that it warrants searching. That's my opinion.

            But pizza also means pizza and you're talking about a pizza joint owner or something. There's nothing about podesta in your picture that's incrimenating, you just associate him with some pizza guy. Is that picture really all the strongest evidence? Because then I think I'm out.

             The Podestas know Alefontis well. There are plenty of casual emails between Tony, John and Alefontis.

             The Podestas are known to

             (when this Pizzagate stuff started, Washington Post weirdly removed this article from 2004). Perhaps the most damning is Kim Noble, a child trafficking victim herself, who suffers from DID (a disorder that splinters her into different personalities, most common among sexually abused children).

             The most convincing part about this whole thing for me is the digital art of the suspects in the Madeline Mccann case.  All the other stuff is intriguing and a little suspicious but I can't get that uncanny resemblance to the Podesta brothers out of my head.  Also the pic of Podesta with the 14 and fish on his hand makes me think he's into some wierd shit considering what all that leads to.

          The original picture of the J'aimes Les enfants was from an instagram page that had the location tagged and it was the cafe/bar you posted with the boom boom room (people checked) . What I thought was odd about that photo was that the guy on the left seemed to have a chunk gouged out of his hand or a flap of skin,  not so much the shirt.

     You've singled out a lot of things individually and stated small problems with them, but you haven't stated a single thing about the fact that all these individual things appear in the same contextual crowd of people.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sure, taken by themselves, one by one, these things could
     <em>
      conceivably
     </em>
     be explained away. But that's not the argument that's being put forth. The argument made by most here is built on the foundation that we have found all these things
     <strong>
      together
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     I'd like to see you explain that away.  Also, a lot of you're arguments are "Lol...I haven't found verification yet..." for a lot of things that you could verify by actually looking for the info for yourself...you could even use this very sob to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
     EDIT: "Ok, don't scream shill or anything..." Proceeds to read the rest of their comments...Yells, "SHILL!!!!" Seriously, one of their arguments is, "But pizza also just means pizza, so you also don't know for sure it's sex with kids".  As if that's our only logic....

      This is the equivalent of those ghost shows which claim every errant noise is a sign that the house must be haunted.
     </p>

      It's nothing. It's a bunch of cherry-picked "evidence" which is then spun to fit the narrative you guys are pushing. Seriously, you start with a fucking chan post of all things as the basis for this pizza code, then apply that pizza = child abuse code to a pizza place which
      <em>
       GASP
      </em>
      happens to serve kids. My god, kids eating at a pizza place! They
      <em>
       must
      </em>
      be molesting them. Why else would kids be at a fucking pizza joint?! /s
     </p>
     <p>
      "But, but John Podesta..."
     </p>
     <p>
      Have any of you guys been to DC? I guarantee you most small businesses near capitol hill know most politicians,
      <em>
       especially
      </em>
      restaurants, most of which are independently owned and have been around for decades. People work around the clock in DC, and a lot of work and meetings are conducted at restaurants. So the fact Podesta and other politicians are friends with the owners of restaurants in DC isn't strange at all. It's actually common. I might be more inclined to believe the podesta stuff if it weren't for the fact he's a known foodie with a penchant for weird art. But then again I've just described a typical white liberal.
     </p>
     <p>
      This whole "investigation" is the definition of confirmation bias. And I've seen everything from child abuse to child cannibalism claims. It's ridiculous.
     </p>
     <p>
      Until I see something concrete, I'll classify pizzagate as a bizarre witch hunt with about as much of a factual basis as claims we didn't land on the moon.

         That statement is a TOTAL lie...so if you're argument is based on an obvious lie, then A) I can't take you seriously, and B) You're wrong.

      But so many of these "things" aren't anything. If every piece of "evidence" has a rational explanation but your only conclusion is "child sex ring", it looks more like you guys are trying to make reality fit into your narrative, instead of exploring all possible solutions.

       You're splitting everything into 2 options: 
"rational explanation" vs. "child sex ring". That's a false, stupid, and overly simplistic. It's a false dialectic....It's more complex that that...Why does this need to be explained to you?

     As a former server, sometimes I wished I could tape children to the table so they wouldn't make such a big mess in the restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
     Also, it's definitely L'Enfant Cafe, the Instagram picture is tagged as being there!!
    </p>
    <p>
     I really don't get how a
     <em>
      pizza restaurant
     </em>
     making Instagram posts with references to
     <em>
      pizza
     </em>
     is them posting secret messages to their kiddie prostitution patrons.

     I agree that "“these are some established terms among pedophile rings, Pizza in particular is cited in a wide range of pedophile communications”  does not count as "verifiable evidence" unless there is some source to back it up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Has anyone found an independent verifiable source confirming the existence of "code talk" using foods?  Or is that just something some person on 4Chan made up?

     The only thing about the Podesta e-mails that stand out to me are the "map" that's "pizza-related" and the mention of a heated pool and kids being provided for "entertainment." What type of "entertainment"? Are the kids gonna show up wearing clown make-up and performing magic tricks and balloon animals?

    The first point uses 4chan as a source. Where are they getting the 'doublespeak' terms from? Did they just make them up based upon assumptions within the email? It's like they were playing Mad Libs in reverse.

    The second misconstrues the Instagram account. It is
    <em>
     not
    </em>
    the Instagram account for the pizza place. It's the personal account for the owner. And Jesus Christ you guys. "Again, the pizza reference." Yeah, it's a baby eat pizza at a pizza place.

     Additionally, the j'aime l'enfant shirt is from a restaurant in DC called l'enfant cafe. And it's named after the guy who designed the DC layout, not children.

     Posted this elsewhere but:
    </p>
    <p>
     Others in this community have posted screenshots from Pedo forums where people are asking for "11-16 slices of pizza", etc.
I agree that the decoder is a weaker piece of evidence, but Pizza specifically is used across a range of Pedo forums and communications. I can't exactly go to Pedo forums and get them myself, but whether you believe the decoder or not, the language used in the emails is strange and cryptic.

       So this message about a handkerchief with a "pizza-related map" doesn't seem strange at all to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta just spilled some pizza sauce on a handerkchief, and the realtor who finds it thinks "you know, this must be Podesta's, and he left it behind, so maybe I'll mail it to him"...?

        Not weird enough to be convinced of this explanation. I haven't seen anyone even explore any other explanations. Like yeah, it's weird, but weird in a "huh old white people are weird, maybe this is an inside joke" way. Not in a "there is definitely a children sex ring" way.
       </p>
       <p>
        Or maybe it's a code for drugs. Or maybe he has a fucking custom handkerchief with a pizza-themed map on it. With the "evidence" that everyone here is using, these are no less likely (actually, probably more likely) than a pedo sex ring.
       </p>
       <p>
        Edit: Yo all of you can downvote me but I've literally only seen people leap straight from that email to "child sex ring." If you want to be a good investigator you have to look at all options, and that is not happening here.

         You're totally right, it's not an airtight story. But these connections alone are strange enough to warrant deeper searching. Ideally by experts and authorities.

          Fine, but in the meantime people are posting pictures of the children with their full names, accusing their parents of being sex traffickers, and marking up pics of the girls with sexual terms. How is that not damaging to the kids?

           The truth is that when these Instagram posts were archived, they were publicly available. I don't condone doxxing at all or going after the families, but this evidence was publicly available until recently. The parents of these kids knew their kids were going to be on the "official Comet Ping Pong" Instagram handle.

            Right, but with instagram people usually assume it's their friends and family. I mean, of course we know it's not, but day-to-day we do tend to assume that.
           </p>
           <p>
            But now many, many strangers are
            <em>
             definitely
            </em>
            looking, you know? And the marked up ones are really awful. Especially the one where the dad is holding his daughter and it has all this text about "analingus" and stuff. Regardless of truth, how is she supposed to feel when she gets old enough and googles herself and sees that?
           </p>
           <p>
            I appreciate you discussing thoughtfully, though.

         The only explanation that I've seen that sounds reasonable (for anything related to this concept that is) is the
         <a href="http://www.sacbolt.com/hankycode.html">
          Handkerchief code
         </a>
         used by the gay community to indicate sexual preferences via different handkerchief colors and patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
         Depending on the design/material a black handkerchief can mean S&amp;M, safe sex, black people, or willing to perform for the camera. Some can be black with a white stripe, or checkered for example.
        </p>
        <p>
         While white can mean jacking off, white people, putting on a show/voyeur, or looking for an orgy. I've seen some speculate white means 'virgin/pedo' but this obviously isn't the normal meaning (someone would need to do more research).
        </p>
        <p>
         I'll add that at this point it's still merely in a speculation phase with some questionable coincidences. The worthwhile thing users could do would be to make a community contributable list of data that could be built upon in individual pieces and also discussed critically (without a bunch screaming 'shills') than jumping the gun with some of this stuff. It's no light matter the claims people are making. This type of thing is usually investigated by trained organizations rather than internet forums.

         Additionally a lot of the original threads where the investigating was REALLY happening have since been deleted from /pol/ but this is more linked in than the information provided. Look up Cheesybay and Bif Skipman's Hawaiian distillery. Look into the connections to Jeffrey Epstein. There are more links. The Arun Rao link who specializes in child trafficking crime.
        </p>
        <p>
         Edit: also Laura Silsby who was confirmed to be connected to the Clinton's and it was exposed through the Wikileaks John Podesta emails. She is actually guilty of trafficking children or trying to steal children from their families in Haiti. Beyond Borders is right across the damn street from the pedo pizza places in question. I mean some of these links are beyond question.

          I have been pouring through all of it for the past week. I think there are some things of interest, but many, many false leads. I think the Comet thing is a false lead, and worse, I think it's damaging to people and distracting from things that might be real. Everyone seized on to very circumstantial and tenuous connections and then ignored other leads or possibilities.
         </p>
         <p>
          Also, anyone pointing out doubts gets called a shill, but for any real investigation to be done, people should look at all analysis.

           Do you mean to tell me that Besta Pizza changing their logo isn't incriminating, after the Internet discovered the FBI has a file where it identifies pedo symbols and it was up on there, a pizza restaurant also owned my Alefantis. Why does the guy need to have to pizza places right next door to each other? Some of the images within the Instagram account of James Alefantis along with the comments are very very incriminating. Understand that everyone is being called a shill because the CTR presence is heavy in both these threads as well as /pol/ and we have already been capable of pretty easily connecting the fact that James Alefantis is "the ex" of David Brock who is responsible for CTR so it isn't without reason that they'd be here trying to mislead everyone and muddle the threads. I have read from numerous threads that DDOS attacks were executed on /pol/ and Reddit deleting threads and up voting people who were attempting to discredit the sources. This was almost directly after the connection to Arun Rao was made. A DOJ agent being involved with this ring and commenting on Alefantis's personal Instagram is alarming especially considering the man handles child trafficking cases. It would make perfect sense for these sick people to be hiding in plain sight and in the highest levels of government.

            If I had a cool logo and then someone brought to my attention that it looked a lot like a pedo symbol i had never heard of, what should I do with that info? Pretend like nothing happened? No, I would change it immediately, especially if my employees were gettong harrassed over it. Distancing from something unsavory only implies that you don't want to be associated with it. It doesn't mean you are guilty or innocent of anything.

            What is incriminating on his ig? Pictures of kids? He runs a business with games and pizza, which kids like. He also probably has friends with kids. He posts sexual pictures? People do that on Instagram. I've not seen anything that combines the two.

            I am not being paid enough as a shill.

            Why would it make perfect sense to hide in plain sight? Why not hide out of sight?
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not saying this can't be true, but I am having trouble understanding why everyone is pretending the most obvious answer is a child sex trafficking ring that centers on a pizza place that has an eccentric owner. That is not the simplest answer. The simplest answer is Podesta fucking loves pasta and gives the starchy sauce vehicle out as a gift.

        Not even a little bit. Look,

         it's "some kind of pizza-related map"!

       <p>
        I mean it was probably a pocket square, not a handkerchief, and those can be pricey - like a silk tie, they might be $50-100 bucks. This is the Town of Suits, you know, and the higher-ups go all out sometimes. A patterned silk pocket square? Yeah, I'd believe that a realtor would mail it back. Why wouldn't they?

        For all you know someone drew directions to a pizza joint on a handkerchief (or napkin).

        Again - confirmation bias. It doesn't even make sense in the pedo interpretation. Map to what? A map to little kids? Ridiculous.

         I'm not convinced that everyone who's skeptical is a shill. I think the shills are probably more sophisticated than that.
        </p>
        <p>
         If I were a shill trying to cover this up, I'd be posting all over Pizzagate about the Satanic religious stuff, this mind control story, and the other theories with little-to-no basis in evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those types of posts do a better job discrediting the search than any skeptic. I'm honestly glad people are skeptical. I'm skeptical. We all should be. But it's hard to deny that this is an extremely strange set of coincidences if that's what it is.

          I agree. I'm skeptical, and it's primarily because of people trying to shoehorn a dozen conspiracy theories into one (e.g. the Satanism angle - seriously?).
         </p>
         <p>
          Coded communication for pedophiles, I can believe. I can acknowledge the possibility of a pedo sex ring in the Washington DC elite, though I won't believe it without better evidence than we've seen so far.
         </p>
         <p>
          But when people start throwing around theories of Satanism, active FBI cover-up operations, "investigators" internet connections  being tampered with, Assange being assassinated, and President Obama being involved... I just can't take that seriously. You simply cannot hide anything that big and messy.

         What's going on is that the evidence presented here is poor and makes massive and unfounded leaps of logic at best. And people are calling out the OP for it.
        </p>
        <p>
         People blindly accepting bullshit "evidence" like "ohhhh, this picture of a baby with a pizza has comments about pizza!" are doing a LOT more harm to this sub than anyone calling out OP for his frankly terrible evidence.

       It really is, and the thing is, all of those things connect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess some people really NEED to see a picture of these guys doing the terrible and horrible things they do, but I'm taking this as a normal approach, have you read the book "Los demonios del Edén? or do you know who Lydia Cacho is?
      </p>
      <p>
       This exact thing happens in other countries, I'm having a hard time thinking these connections are "coincidences" because it's basically what Lydia's case and she got shot for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her biggest evidence was phone calls, that's the only thing we are missing, and that's the only difference between this case and Lydia's.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's confirmed this happens around the world, I don't thing the US is saved from it.

      The whole thing. I wish the world was so interesting that you could uncover a demonic liberal sex ring covered up by a pizza front. The world that came from sounds less dull at least.

      if you truly can't see it i don't know if there's any point in telling you. but here's a few quick things
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       it's a bit odd for a bunch of politicians to use 4chan pedophile slang
      </li>
      <li>
       why the hell would an international pedophile ring brag about their deeds on fucking instagram
      </li>
      <li>
       the 4chan post with all the extra slang is just unsourced bullshit. watch i can do it too
      </li>
      <li>
       "jack" = heroin
      </li>
      <li>
       "jill" = funds diverted to the taliban
      </li>
      <li>
       "hill" = international circumcision fetishists
      </li>
      <li>
       "jack and jill went up the hill" is now proof of a conspiracy
      </li>
      <li>
       that pizza logo is the result of someone googling "clip art pizza". i mean really. like i'm not sure how to explain to you that their logo is not evidence of a fucking pedophile ring. besides why would they advertise it? for random street pedos to walk in? wouldn't they keep it on the down low?
      </li>
      <li>
       i'm too drunk to read the haiti section rn
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      on a personal note,
     </p>

     Whether or not it is him, isn't the shirt an open advertisement for liking children?

      No it's an open advertisement for l'enfant cafe &amp; bar. A place in DC, which is called "l'enfant", much like many other things in DC, because the architect who designed the layout of DC had the last name l'enfant.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is literally nothing sinister about it. There's a metro station here called l'enfant, and a ton of other places/things.

          I learned it in 5th grade civics - in a 5000-person town in rural Minnesota. The L'Enfant plan is an important part of American history. Iconic. It's as important as the Liberty Bell.

         So I assume they sell t-shirts like this out there? Cause I can't find anything in a quick Google search.

        Believe it or not they sell stuff here that isn't on the internet - a
        <em>
         lot
        </em>
        of local screen-print runs, cheap Chinese shit. Mostly to the tourists around the Mall. And these guys will print
        <em>
         anything
        </em>
        - bootleg copies of licensed merch, the logo of popular shows, Three Wolf Moon, anything that seems popular. From street kiosks and from storefronts in warehouse districts you could barely call "retail." I pass by a couple when I go to Union Market (mmm, Benton's bacon!)

      THIS would make a great case. IF he changed his name. if we can get evidence of that, then the shirt would pale in comparison pointing to something fishy.

    A random 4chan post is hardly convincing evidence that "pizza is cited in a wide range of pedophile communications". Is that seriously the basis for that info or is there something more that was accidentally left out?

     Others in this community have posted screenshots from Pedo forums where people are asking for "11-16 slices of pizza", etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     I agree that the decoder is a weaker piece of evidence, but Pizza specifically is used across a range of Pedo forums and communications. I can't exactly go to Pedo forums and get them myself, but whether you believe the decoder or not, the language used in the emails is strange and cryptic.

      16? Seeing as they probably aren't enjoying it, wouldn't it start to get dangerous at that point? Like they could get killed by their victim.

    Not just "Hillary getting involved" when Americans are caught stealing children from Haiti, but she's apparently on a first-name basis with them.

     i've done a lot of looking into them, and as weird and occult as they are, they don't have enough connection to the Podestas or Clintons. The weirdest video is a private 30th birthday party.
    </p>
    <p>
     I've been to some weird drag shows before. I don't think there's enough evidence to tie them to this.

    Absolutely horrifying that these people are connected with organizations like Amber Alert. Makes me wonder how many of these kids who disappeared into thin air and were never found again are now apart of these sicko's harems.

     Will try to circulate this and see if anyone can find anything. Doesn't look like resolution was met in the thread.

    What about the two Korean journalists who were rescued from North Korea at one point by the Lolita express(or Clinton), and later show up in the emails with the pizza jpg, while responders make odd comments about the picture?

     There absolutely is, but we need a foundation to build from, and this is the most compelling hard evidence I found in about a week of digging.

    I would add that walnut may refer to the undeveloped vulva of a small girl. Not person of color.

     Wow. Unreal. I just responded to this thread. It links up very suspiciously with the "Puttanesca sauce - we'd like to taste it" from an Italian location abbreviated "p.zza" or "square".
    </p>
    <p>
     Makes me wonder if this all traces back to an Italian square. With the rampant mafia control, it seems like a prime country to run a human trafficking ring.
    </p>
    <p>
     Edit: did not realize this was unrelated to the Podesta or Clinton leaks, but we'll see if anything comes of the translations.

    Are there any other codewords (or sets of codewords) generally in use for pedophilia? I've been trying to google this, but the only source I can find is that one 4chan post. Everything else just refers back to that.

    This is the most concise, convincing presentation I have seen on the subject. Yet it is still nothing close to proof. It's the hint of something suspicious; but unfortunately I don't see any way of this group exposing anything
