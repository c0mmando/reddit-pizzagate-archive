    Has anyone seen if there's a connection there? The defendant, the judge, any odd surrounds on the case years ago?

    At the very least it shows how comfortable she is surrounding herself with pedophilia.

    Another thing I'm thinking about while at work. I'm thinking that the Clinton Fondation is used for laundering the money. With this in mind, I was reminded of the Panama papers thing. Not sure if there's any value in there but I would think it's worth a look.

    My thinking is that the foundation is used to launder the money. The pizza place is just a front. Kind of like how the mob would have a store that'd people would go buy stuff at. If you were the right person, you'd ask for bread and get an AK (something along those lines).

    Once I get home I'll be able to do some more digging.

    I wondered if this case was what got her into this dark world in the first place. Perhaps this is how she got tapped.

     Like if the guy got in her head?

     Sheesh, planet altering meeting if so.  I prefer to think she was already gone.
