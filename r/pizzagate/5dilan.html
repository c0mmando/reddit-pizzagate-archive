    A sick approach to the Pizzagate scandal from conservative Turkish groups
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Hey people,
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm sending this just as an informative post for those who follow this subreddit.
   </p>
   <p>
    As you have noticed, large Turkish online communities are talking about and spreading this scandal.
   </p>
   <p>
    Indeed, even news of it has been widely made in conservative Turkish media. However, their reason to publish this scandal openly is different...
   </p>
   <p>
    Here, just past month, a huge pedophilia scandal involving religious schools was revealed. And all this conservative press tried very hard to prevent the news from reaching out, and in just one day, the government banned any news regarding this incident.
   </p>
   <p>
    And now, all government-fed press, who had tried to cover up our very own scandal, agreed on one thing: Yes, children are raped and molested here in religious schools, but don't you see, it happens in US as well.
   </p>
   <p>
    I just wanted to let you know this way of thinking is part of the reason why this scandal is commonly discussed in Turkey.

     They just tried to pass a law to protect child rapists today. It's gonna be voted by MPs next week. I made a thread about it. https://m.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dijsr/ruling_party_in_turkey_is_trying_to_pass_a_law/

     exactly, and while spreading this scandal, we are also in need of spreading something else: these men have all acted like three monkeys when it comes to pedophilia of people of the same religion as themselves.

     No, there is no priority level on this issue. Turkish government's connection with Ensar Pedophilia Ring is already proven. There are convicted fellons on that issue.

    I doubt when it was first discussed at Ek≈üi it was with this motivation. It was (and still is) looked at like "holy shit this is crazy" point of view.
   </p>
   <p>
    However when mainstream media and Islamists talk about it its more like "see America is bad" type of thing.

     Actually i disagree, i know lots of people reacted in good manners and tried to contribute to creation of content in Turkish, but in reality, the topic was created by the government's paid troll. But of course, while talking about "discussing the scandal with molesting legalization concerns", i do not mean those communities where users create the content.
