<p>This isn't dis/misinformation. It is all related. Here is the BLUF. There is a shadowy organization called International Narcotic and Law (INL). They are a "joint-venture" officially between State and a couple other 3 letter agencies.</p>
<p>First, look at their charter and reach: https://www.state.gov/j/inl/</p>
<p>Next, understand that they operate their own airwing. Up to and including, C130, C135, helos, etc. They are a ready made smuggling infrastructure. Private planes, no tail numbers, classified cargo, unlisted airfields. Very easy to traffic humans.</p>
<p>The subcontractors (usual suspects), have been involved in a bunch of nasty stuff:</p>
<p>https://newrepublic.com/article/120269/contractors-violate-us-zero-tolerance-policy-human-trafficking</p>
<p>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/02/foreign-contractors-hired-dancing-boys</p>
<p>Deeper searches will reveal more.</p>
<p>I can also tell you, that this entity was complicit in Karzai's "poppy eradication" programs (fly over 10 X 20 hc poppy fields, destroy 1 X 5 hc poppy field). I can also tell you that there were some of these guys busted for flying while high on heroin. This is a testimony to some of these guys' broken moral compasses.</p>
<p>Child trafficking is an old business, as evidenced by the widespread practice of bachu bazzi (sp), aka "dancing boys" in AFG. What better place to skim off children than a warzone which is already conducive to such practices. Children are a commodity, just like opium.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is the case of the Florida School for Boys, in Marianna, FL aka Dozier School for Boys.</p>
<p>While it doesn't quite reach the threshold of CP + SRA, it's still horrific. And it will give you some insight into the minds of the victims (countless interviews). The interesting thing, is that this case was used as 1/4 citations in a Wikispooks short entry on the "Pedophocracy". I was going to ask the author about the association, but he died a couple years ago of lung cancer.</p>
<p>So, as the newb, let me know if I can be of any assistance.</p></p>
