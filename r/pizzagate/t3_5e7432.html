<strong>Get these bots or whatever fucking out of here</strong>
<p><p>Why the fuck are people saying to start promoting other causes. We need to stick to our focus of finding and catching social elites involved in "pizza parties" and pedophilia acts with children. This is just a way for people to bring there bullshit in and distract us.</p></p>

<p><p>We might be in the early stages of fighting this 'AI' we have been warned about. When it comes to the internet we dont know whos real and whos not and in order to keep our privacy we need it that way. </p>
<p>How do you suggest we easily get rid of said "bots" ?
I've programmed some and i can tell you they mimic human behavior very closely.</p></p>

<p><p>I have no idea. Its scary these people are willing to throw away all the hardwork by the research groups by lumping this cause with other phony ones. Id suggest finding a way to track patterns normally but if this program is so well wrote we cant discern any obvious ones well need someone with more experience than I.
Edit. Spelling</p></p>
