<strong>Shadow Banned on Twitter for word "DUTROUX"?</strong>
<p><p>Has anyone else been shadow banned in the last 24 hrs for covering pizzagate - and did you notice what content caused it? I'm pretty sure for me it was posting a tweet that mentioned "Dutroux" - but not 100% sure. </p>
<p>This legal case verified by wikileaks also names an important American -person- most of you have probably heard of. I am literally afraid to post the name and implications. </p>
<p>But here's some links on Dutroux just because I'm an angry contrarian. </p>
<p>Here is the most important explanation I've found. </p>
<p>http://lifeonchildreninthemix.com/BELGIUM.html </p>
<p>Here's an english translation of the dossier:</p>
<p>https://dutrouxscandalanalysis.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/english-translation-of-wikileaks-dutroux-dossier-pages-1-40-of-1235/</p>
<p>And here's the original on wikileaks. It's in French (there has never been an English translation provided by wikileaks even though they said they would give one ) and the Belgian govt are suing to have it removed from wikileaks' site. </p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Belgium:_Dutroux_dossier_summary,_1235_pages,_2005</p>
<p>Also-
http://www.wikileaks-forum.com/belgium/358/translation-belgium-dutroux-dossier-summary-1235-pages-2005/16315/</p>
<p>So - how does this relate to pizzagate? Well it explains a huge amount of background and history information which I strongly suspect is still at work today; it is a legal document not anecdote, AND, it is recorded by wikileaks so 100% verified. </p>
<p>It is one of the most dangerous pieces of information we have at our disposal. I know many of us already know about this case, but I don't think people fully realize how important this one particular document is. </p></p>

<p><p>One of the best sources on the web re: the Dutroux case is:
https://isgp-studies.com/belgian-x-dossiers-of-the-dutroux-affair
https://isgp-studies.com/scare
The author is Joel van der Reijden, an excellent researcher. He used to expose a lot of secret societies at isgp.eu, but now the site has moved to https://isgp-studies.com. </p>
<p>The Dutroux case, Demmink, Jimmy Saville, The Franklin Coverup, PizzaGate: they all point to the very obvious conclusion that there is sufficient proof to lock the perpetrators up for life, but it is always covered up...
The crimes will continue unless we drain the swamp and organize a tribunal ourselves to bring them to justice. </p></p>

<p><p>I agree, but that sight you linked has NSFW images of children and that's why I didn't include it. It's a shame such good research has to have these images. There used to be an english version of the site w/out images but the link is down atm. </p>
<p>I totally agree with you - the longstanding history of these cases and the fact that they are interconnected means that this is not one isolated pedophile ring, it is a syndicate. It reveals something larger going on about the real structure and operation of TPBT, I guess.</p></p>

<p>For us laypeople who want to keep up with these unfolding events while still maintaining an arm's length distance, we thank you.  I for one badly want to see these people brought to justice, but I do not want to have to see graphic images of their handiwork in the process.</p></p>

<p><p>Michael Aquino</p>
<p>CIA </p>
<p>Proven link here and in Franklin. Both times in legal docs. I am not saying that out of a right wing fear of satanism. I'm a green voter. He just happens to be named in both LEGAL cases, and in this one it is a wiki doc as well. So...... Yeah...... </p>
<p>Now google the 1987 "finders" doc. I am trying to find it now but it is conveniently scrubbed from google atm it looks like...</p>
<p>The CIA took over that case as soon as it came up, (says that in official file according to FBI agent who wrote it I will screen shot) it's another legit gov't doc by the treasury department. It shows that the FBI was investigating until the CIA took over and turned it into an "internal matter." Blood rituals and mental programming as well as sex abuse and international trafficking were involved here. </p>
<p>What does that tell you about the role of our own govt in this entire mess? A lot of us know this and are too chickenshit to post about it. </p>
<p>Here's a version of the file that looks less credible because it has newspaper articles posted with it. Pay attention to the Treasury Department report, that's what is important - print it, make copies, screen shot, this probably will be taken down. https://archive.org/stream/ThisIsTheCiafindersFile/Finders#page/n25/mode/2up</p></p>

<p><p>Here is an important screen shot from the finders doc.</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/O4oj14.png </p>
<p>"....investigation into the Finders had become a <strong><em>*CIA internal matter.</em></strong>* The MPD report has been classified secret and was not available for review. I was advised that the FBI had withdrawn from the investigation several weeks prior and that the FBI Foreign Counter Intelligence Division had directed MPD not to advise the FBI Washington field office of anything that had transpired.</p>
<p>No further information will be available.</p>
<p>No further action will be taken...</p>
<p>No action to be taken on the basis of this report."</p></p>

<p><p>Unfortunately, I've known this for a while and only us tin foil hatters were talking about it. I'm so glad it's finally coming to light but I'm sad we have to learn these horrors, it's too much to deal with. FTW.</p></p>

<p><p>If we can just spread this though - because even most people in pizza gate aren't recognizing the military role here, which to me is the most terrifying and legitimately dangerous aspect to talk about. </p>
<p>Putting tinfoil hat on - you want to know one thing Monica Petersen ran into in Haiti, other than just the Clinton Foundation? USAID - they were involved significantly in the Caracol complex she was looking into. Not at all concerning. /removing tin foil hat. </p>
<p>(I assume we all know what USAID is here)</p></p>

<p><p>Agreed, agreed, and agreed.</p>
<p>You might be interested in this photo, but derailing a bit. This is the same location Monica was talking about. https://t.co/nwPu727Cl1</p>
<p>But you can see how much USAID is prominent just visually here. If there is something dirty in this location with the Clinton Foundation, then <em>USAID</em> are probably heavily involved as well from appearances here.</p>
