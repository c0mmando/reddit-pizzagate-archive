        <p><p>Just playing the devil's advocate here...</p>
<p>Twittergate was trending on Twitter, and some of the accounts are MUCH older than this subreddit..</p>
<p>Twittergate was probably exposed to more people in a few hours than pizzagate has since it came into fruition, regardless of the tremendous growth this sub is garnering.</p>
<p>Twittergate was very cut and dry.. You didn't have to read 20 pages of information just to begin to understand.. </p>
<p>So if you combine the simplicity of the story, the effectiveness of Molly's leaking, the fact that her Twitter had 1 million+ hits in a single day, and the fact that twittergate was exposed a much bigger audience......</p>
<p>Is it really far fetched to believe that twittergate might get more coverage? </p></p>

        <p><p>I don't think it's a bad thing. There is almost no way for a normal person to go from ignorance to the hideous level of evil that even we have a hard time to  wrap our heads around. 
Twitter gate may be what "primes" people's minds to the possibility that this isn't just tinfoil hat stuff. And with Obama going around warning everyone about "fake news" it really looks suspicious when this stuff starts filtering through MSM.</p></p>

        <p><p>Ehhh- i dont think that you can assume twittergate is a cover up lol.  The problem with pizzagate is that there still isnt any cold hard dead-to-rights evidence.. It is basically just based on weird code in emails and linking people and businesses together in a very suspicious way.  It would sort of be libelous for the news to report it because there isnt really a conclusion per se. Could you imagine if we were wrong and the media painted a bunch of people like pedophiles?  They could probably be sued.</p>
<p>Twittergate on the other hand is pretty cut and dry- you have the people, you have their pages, and there is just straight up kiddie porn.  Bing bang boom, its all on the table and it is not convoluted or complicated in any way.</p>
<p>But again- you people underestimate the intrigue factor here.  Shit like twittergate gets people reading and looking around; not to mention people keep mixing twittergate up with pizzagate.  Havent you noticed the influx of subscribers here the past few days?  Any exposure of this shit at all is helpful to this cause.  And the icing on the cake would be if this severly dents twitter.  Twitter is cucked and in the politcal pocket</p></p>

        <p><p>This is def plausible but what can we do? This shit is complicated enough as it is without worrying about every major lead is a head fake.</p>
<p>People should follow up on twittergate, but follow up on pizzagate too. </p></p>

        <p><p>I don't feel the same way. This twittergate at very least is going to promote awareness of pizzagate - and that in itself is a step in the right direction. </p></p>

        <p><p>One thing is for sure, Alex Jones was tagged in many of the tweets exposing this, urging him to say something. He has not as of yet. If you needed proof he was controlled opposition, this is it.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm being criticized for suggesting this. Glad I'm not completely alone.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the technique that firefighters use to put out a brush fire. Get ahead of it, with a controlled burn, and burn enough area that the brush fire can't proceed. Eventually, it will burn itself out and the rest of the fuel will remain safe.</p>
<p>People will get their fill of this. "Justice" will be served; and the Pizzagate investigation  will fall by the wayside. It will also serve to validate stronger censorship and suppression of open discussion.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that they'll also use it to make an example of a few Internet investigaters who flew too close to the sun.</p></p>

        <p><p>Agreed, Twitter has been exposed as covering for pedos in the past and obviously they are still around so we don't want the same thing to happen, #PizzaGate will get people really angry and there is plenty of disturbing evidence for it.</p>
<p>The Cabal's bag of tricks include deflect and divert so like the OP said we gotta stay on topic.</p>
<p>I have been tagging Russia Today, Sputnik News and others on Twitter to try and get more attention to this information.</p></p>

        <p><p>I can only hope that, whether or not it was meant to deflect attention, it puts this sort of thing on the radar to some degree, and that it will do something to make others take similar issues more seriously. </p></p>
