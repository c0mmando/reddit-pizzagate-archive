    It looks like Palimeri wasn't clued in? She can't understand why such a meeting would garner such large donations?

    The part about having dinner at my "places" says it for me. As in "take your pick from the gay or srtaight venues and adults or children".

     No, as in, the two restaurants he owns that are on the same block as the bookstore where Podesta was giving a reading from his book.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, you've been told that he's a pedophile and how everything is really in code, so that's how you're going to see it.

       I eat pizza (actual pizza) at least once a week. Sometime order in, sometimes out with friends. I don't have a single email or text in the entirety of my phone that mentions pizza.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are several referencing the restaurant we go to "Gino's" but never actually the word pizza. Just sayin.

    "Would you like to have a dinner at my places?!?

    Big or small. What do you think?"

   <p>
    and

   <p>
    "I can probably get there around 8:30. Love to do somethind after
politics and prose. Catch up on that early in the week."
   </p>
   <p>
    Reading James's questions they wouldn't make sense to John if it wasn't an understood code.  Unless they had had a recent conversation to a degree that "big or small" would immediately make sense.  I don't believe that's the case.
   </p>
   <p>
    Looking at John's responses, he seems to answer the big or small question with, "Catch up on that early in the week".  He uses "that" instead of a more specific word. When two people have conversations that they both know what each other is talking about without it making sense at all on a general read they are talking in code.  There aren't many things they could be talking about that they have formed a habit of doing to the point they recognize the code immediately.

       Call around and ask friends if they'd like to join you.  Figure out how many will be in your party then call him on Monday and let him know so he can reserve a table.

        Could be, but I don't know why the question would get its own paragraph if it was a continuation of the previous questions.

      Also, if it's referring to the size of the get together why would it have its own paragraph?

    The big or small comment is way too random.

    Another oddity -- they're having "a dinner" would have to take place rather late at night.
   </p>
   <p>
    You can infer this because they were going to watch the vice presidential debate beforehand, which lasted 90 minutes.
   </p>
   <p>
    And started around 8.
   </p>
   <p>
    So that means they would have "a dinner" at "places" around 11pm-midnight, and it would involve some x that is "big or small."
   </p>

    Nothing conclusive on its own, but when taken cumulatively  with all of the other pieces of data it appears to be a strange way to word things, at the very least.
