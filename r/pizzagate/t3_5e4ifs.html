<p>At this point, I'd be more annoyed at myself for blatant dismissal in the past. What if they are all true?</p></p>

        <p><p>There are very valid questions to be asked about 9/11 however once the CTR sort got involved and started an entire campaign of insanity like "there were no planes" the entire "movement" became seen as insanity...and that is what is happening here.</p></p>

        <p><p>Remember that they might be genuinely looking for justice.... but if the Clinton Clan comes to Comey and says: look bastard... here's the deal... you expose us and you and/or your family is dead...   his priorities would logically change ... so... maybe some are colluded or pedophiles themselves... but I believe most of them (including comey) are just VICTIMS of the clinton clan.... the day before comey stated that the clinton email investigation was over with no crimes some FBI agent was found "suicided" with his wife... and the house set on fire... so... yeah.. .PedoRingers are FUCKING CRIMINALS !! So don't asume that people who are trying to cover up are willingly doing it... most of them are saving their asses... like literally ... it is a matter of life or death to them. </p></p>

        <p><p>Sorry.  That just doesn't fly.  The FBI is paid to bring criminals to justice.  Cowardice ain't in the job description--if your'n a coward, find a snowflake job.</p>
<p>And besides, this has been going on for freaking 50+ years!  All the way back to pedo Hoover, who was a cross-dressing pedo, bought and paid for by the mob.  Look at Franklin Scandal.  Look at Dorothy Hunt plane crash.  Look at jfk.  Look at rfk.  Look....I could go on and on.  The FBI has been corrupt for a very long time.  </p>
<p>Sad but true.  I dare anyone to deny this.</p></p>

Yes they are....but when an agent tried to do something about it..he found himself locked up. Only a fed. judge who didn't believe the gov. story saved his ass...still life ruined.</p>

        <p><p>There were many reports , i just googled some right now bz I didn't saved the one I read:</p>
<p>http://www.morningnewsusa.com/fbi-agent-michael-brown-and-wife-dead-hillary-clinton-cleared-of-all-charges-23119767.html</p>
<p>https://emsnews.wordpress.com/2016/11/06/fbi-agent-investigating-clinton-murders-wife-burns-house-commits-suicide/</p>

<p>http://www.livetradingnews.com/clinton-e-mail-investigation-fbi-agent-involved-case-found-murdered-20846.html#.WDNAqdR97Gh</p>
<p>Also I just saw that apparently he "commited suicide" along with his wife on nov 4... comey's statement was on nov 6 ... so I was mistaken... it was not the day before... it was 2 days before , but anyways... you get the idea</p></p>

        <p><p>Did you read those links?  In the first one you shared they state 6 or 7 paragraphs in, "As it turns out, the news of Michael Brown’s death was falsified and has since been debunked by Snopes. Denver Guardian, which published the news, is nothing more than a fake news site hiding under a pretext of a city newspaper." - The original story cited a town that doesn't exist in MD, as well as a police chief of that fake town, who is also not real.  http://thedailyhaze.com/fbi-agent-michael-brown-murder-suicide/</p>
<p>Interesting also that the fake article uses "Michael Brown," the same name of the man shot by police in Ferguson, MO.  Maybe so it would catch more eyes/SEO points, and stick in people's heads more easily?  This is disinformation my friend.</p></p>

        <p><p>Personally I keep an open mind and evaluate articles on their merit. Snopes has done TONS of great work over the years exposing disinformation. I'm not in this camp of "if they don't align with my worldview they're a shill"</p></p>

        <p><p>I wanted to ask if there is some kind of plan in case the authorities like FBI or general prosecutor will do nothing? What next? What if they hope, that people will just talk for a while or write in a newspapers, but then forget in a month or two? How can we influence the authorities? Maybe there is a need for an online platform so we can propose some people we know for the office (that are actually good and really smart people) so they can propose solutions for economics, politics, judicial system, ecological problems and so on... their program sort of speak. After that we can choose and vote for one person and then give him 1 dolar so he can have the funds and run for the actual office and make a real change, not like Hilary or Donald. That would be great, because this man would be truly chosen by the people after hearing what is he offering. We can choose wisely, we are not stupid, we couldn't make a choice worst then Trump or Clinton. Wouldn't that be great? We just need a good place in internet for that.</p></p>

        <p><p>If Alefantis and Podesta get caught and charged, will this sub continue to investigate child abusers and traffickers? This is a huge worldwide problem, and this sub has gathered an awful lot of manpower with a common mission. The government agencies are either inefficient, incompetent, or complicit, and an internet-based task force has already done a better job of bringing this to public attention.</p>
<p>Someone needs to learn exactly what evidence 1 law enforcement needs before they can conduct a raid or w/e, and 2 holds up in a court of law to be able to successfully prosecute. It may be worth contacting either govt or non-govt organizations that work with prosecuting traffickers/pedophiles and asking about what they would need in order to catch these guys. Maybe you could even say "we found a highly suspicious individual, and we have X, Y, Z evidence, what else would you need?"</p></p>

        <p><p>You pay them for the exact same reason why you pay for any government service even if they serve against it's people, because you are forced to. Governments use a portion of the money they extort to buy weapons to enable the further extortion of cash. Initially services such as the FBI were created with good intentions, but as increased bureaucracy and increased taxation keep reinforcing each other it soon became just another bureaucratic arm made to serve exclusively the political elite funding them. </p></p>

        <p><p>We pay them to cover up the crimes of the government, and further governmental interests, often at the expense of our own. They have been unbelievably useful for that over the years. They absolutely are complicit, Franklin cover-up as one example. </p></p>

        <p><p>I'll be the first to say it, I am in the VIP protection business and a former associate of a well organised group with ties back in Asia. If nothing is done by authorities there should be a group of guys with similar backgrounds as myself willing to research and get answers the old school way. Just my 2 cents.</p></p>
