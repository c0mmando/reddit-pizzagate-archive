        <strong>I've lived and worked in Haiti off and on since 2012. I have connections in private sector, government, and missionary. You're all right. The Haiti connection goes deep.</strong>
        <p><p>I have access to 
1) hundreds of bishops and religious leaders around Haiti, especially in Pap
2) trustworthy close friends in and around PaP, men and women (Haitian, American, and British) whom I would trust with my life
3) a colleague and old friend (our relationships is a bit broken due to disagreements in business, but nothing I can't mend if necessary) who personally knows ex-President Martelly and a dozen government and UN officials (some of whom I've been personally introduced to in early October, 2016)</p>
<p>Government and also UN soldiers interest and involvement in child pornography and trafficking is a fact of life unfortunately. My ex-business partner told me he's been approached in his club by UN soldiers asking if he'd get involved with child porn.</p>
<p>It's very taboo to talk about because most Haitians, even if they don't practice it, believe in Voodoo. It's imbedded in their culture. Just like how many Americans share some sort of superstitions, so do they.</p>
<p>I mainly lurk on Reddit, but I feel like I must get involved somehow. I need some direction, advice, or help from people on how to do this. </p>
<p>I've always thought Haiti's corruption is long, deep and  irredeemable. Until now.</p>
<p>I'm sitting on a mountain of potential resources. I know the culture, I know and have witnessed the reality, and I can't sit back and let it happen now that I know it is bigger than just Haiti.</p>
<p>EDIT: I've reached out to some long time missionaries who lived among the people for 3-4 years. They know the culture and stories very well. I've also reached out to current Haitian residents in PaP. Good and trustworthy friends. I'll post whatever they have to say about Clinton Foundation, UN, and government involvement in child sex rings. 
I'll also ask about the mines and Monica Peterson.</p></p>

        <p><p>It goes all the way to the Vatican, doesn't it? There's way too many Jesuit/knights of Malta/hospitallers "charities" operating in Haiti for it to not be a coincidence and I've been trying to tell people that in here for weeks.</p></p>

        <p><p>The Vatican is the largest front operation in the entire world, it's front face is Catholicism, it's actual purpose is controlling money left over from The Roman Empire, peddling dark occult traditions passed down from the Roman Empire, namely pedophilia, and ensuring that the power of the Roman Empire lives until eternity.  </p>
<p>The Catholic Church is nothing more than a giant 'octopus' operation on behalf of the Roman Empire.  I know this is a very hard pill for many to swallow, but once you take a step back and look at the facts, you will start to see the whole puzzle come together.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Oh trust me I'm aware and I've been trying to redpill people in here on that fact for weeks now but no one believes me and people always try to discredit, which I've found very common ever since I started talking about Jesuits and the Knights of Malta on Reddit. </p>
<p>It's a super simple concept to me- trilateral state was probably set up so the Vatican can run their international crime syndicate through the 3 most populated countries in the world. Clinton Foundation is nothing more than an arms/children dealer set up on behalf of the black pope/Vatican to traffic weapons and arms internationally and that's why D.C. pizza joints are being outed which is probably less than 2% of what's really going on. All roads always lead back to Rome!</p></p>

        <p><p>I majored in history and I spent a significant portion of my study on the Roman Empire.  The Roman Empire never "died", it just wholesale "converted" to Christianity to hide and mask it's operations. </p>
<p>That is why the financiers of the world throughout the middle ages were from Venice, because they controlled the money cult.  </p>
<p>While I don't think that all roads lead to rome, I think most of them do.  I think there is a world wide power struggle between Rome, The Rothschild banking interests (which could be fronting for Rome), and the American Military Industrial Complex super state.  </p>
<p>Their time has now come to an end, the newest power structure in the world is what I term 'the information super-grid', or "The Hive", people like us being able to shift public opinion by posting on the right threads, leaking truth on Facebook, twitter, youtube and the like, and counteracting the control grid.  </p></p>

        <p><p>1) dont go offsite
2) dont download anything some randomer sends you on PM
3) dont go to the gym anymore
4) no identifying info
5) read the summary threads we have, perhaps one of the mind maps. Do you see any big names missing that we should be aware off?</p>

<p>think there is another one that i might be missing. </p></p>

        <p><p>hmm. you are right. i guess what i meant is not to go to chats / email exchanges etc. obviously we still have to go do research. </p>
<p>i agree that site link might seem dodgy, not sure how else to present it. tried to archive it but it doesnt show up.</p>
<p>however simply going on https://coggle.it/ shows that its a mind map kind of site )) </p></p>

        <p><p>There's more info on the Caracol-EKAM housing project here: https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dxlki/the_people_of_haiti_even_have_a_name_for_the/</p>
<p>I've been looking up the origins of the word "Ekam" and found something VERY interesting. The temple of the Hindu supreme god, the Lord Shiva, is "Ekambaram", or "Lord of the Mango Tree".</p>
<p>So, the Caracol-EKAM housing project which Monica Petersen was investigating has an interesting connection to the mango tree.</p>
<p>Remember the mysterious email from Cheryl Mills to Hillary Clinton where mango trees are discussed:</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/19339</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Only two mango trees had to be uprooted at the Caracol Park. Trees under threat are now being transplanted to the Caracol Ekam housing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this could all be totally innocuous; hypothetically, however, is it possible that Amrita and Ashok Mahbubani who operate a charitable foundation in Haiti,the EKTA foundation (another Hindu word), have an intimate connection with the EKAM housing project?</p>
<p>And is it possible that "mango tree" means temporary housing for children ("mangos") in the Caracol-Ekam housing project who are about to be passed into the international pipeline--- stowed away in USAID shipping containers in the Caracol factory warehouses and delivered to the nearby Cap-Haitien airport for transport around the globe?</p></p>

        <p><p>This may or may not be relevant. There is a Mango Tree Village Orphanage in Port-au-Prince in Haiti which features a picture of Bill Clinton prominently on the front page of the website:</p>
<p>http://themangotreevillage.com/</p>
<p>There is even a video of happy Haitian children entitled "The Mangos":</p>

        <p><p>It's true, but the fact that it is a Hindu name and it is connected to mango trees could point to a connection with the philanthropic Mahbubani's, who own the EKTA (another Hindu word) Foundation and who are associated with Tony Podesta.</p>
<p>Amrita and Ashok Mahbubani cooked an Indian dinner at Tony's house in DC which could possibly not have been what it seemed. It required the use of a pizza oven and they served "fresh, sweet mango" for dessert.</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/59243</p>
<p>Ashok sent John Podesta the pictures from the Casa Podesta Pizza Party which he said "capture the spirit of the evening.</p>

        <p><p>Speaking of Monica, could she be related to Kristin Peterson who is the former CEO and founder of Inveneo, an ITC program in Haiti under the auspices of the EKTA Foundation?</p>
<p>The EKTA Foundation is owned by Amrita and Ashok Mahbubani, who cooked the Indian dinner at Tony Podesta's house in DC which required the use of a pizza oven. </p>

        <p><p>oh sorry...well yeah...look I believe you..because I have heard similar things....my best advice is to reveal as much as possible without compromising yourself.</p>
<p>That's what I'm doing...literally being on here post election (I wasn't allowed to be on here prior) has helped me put lots of pieces together...and it's going to have to be the little people that bring this shit down...because the bigguns are compromised.</p>
<p>Be careful...you probably shouldn't have revealed what KIND of work you do specifically as there cannot have been many of you.</p></p>

        <p><p>Exactly. I wonder if it is similar in the other countries they operate in. Do you have a hard source on any of this? Thinking about making an infographic.</p></p>

        <p><p>My Haitian friend from PaP says that in order to enroll in public or private school you must get your child a birth certificate. However, many poor families and also ones far from the cities do not send their kids to school, so no certificate. 
Getting a birth certificate he says "they don't pay much for [a birth certificate], almost nothing].</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, I don't doubt that the Denver airport is part of the puzzle. Maybe this is where they fly in some of the children? If the tunnels are true, it's possible that they keep them in the tunnels until they're ready to fly/transport them elsewhere.</p></p>

        <p><p>UN soldier child abuse is rampant, soldiers have asked my ex-business partner for child porn. He then asked me to find untraceable ways to gather it and I'm sure he would have moved to produce it. I am sure because he had previously asked about becoming involved in the adult film industry.
I obviously parted ways with him after this. We do not get along. I'm hoping I didn't totally burn the bridge for the sake of finding out more for you guys.
He claims I owe him money for severing business ties. Maybe I'll have to pay my debt to get information. I might do it.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's common for adults in the countryside to sell their children into forced labor for wealthy people. This almost always turns abuse. Sexually and otherwise. It's part of the culture and a way to put food on the table.</p></p>

        <p><p>If you are not technically savvy, then there isn't a whole lot you can do. </p>
<p>Your best bet is to go undercover with hidden cameras and get people on camera talking about it. Like always, follow the money. </p></p>

        <p><p>One, yes. I stopped doing business with him as I found out I was pretty much doing consulting work for his shell companies. How am I suppose to show return-on-investment with a company that only exists for money laundering? Getting this guy to talk (especially if I started asking questions now) is going to be hard. I can't do it alone and guarantee my own safety, honestly.</p>
<p>He's says I owe him money for severing business ties (which is ridiculous) so I'm stepping on egg shells with him right now. He says we will "talk face-to-face" when he comes to the states. He thinks he's intimidating me but he doesn't understand I live in the Midwest on a farm with an open carry license. I think he wanted a reaction to his empty threat. Not biting.</p></p>

        <p><p>The only thing that's going to bust this open is video footage. Even documentation and testimony won't break people out of their slumber on this issue. I don't know we do it. </p>
<p>BE CAREFUL! If you ask an old colleague, make sure they're not involved. You might walk into a trap if you ask for help exposing from someone involved.</p></p>

        <p><p>How would you breakdown the way people in Haiti feels about the Clintons:  i.e. this region thinks the Clinton's are 'this', overall Haitians think the Clintons are 'this', if you were to do a poll in Haiti, the Clinton favorability would be somewhere around <strong><em>_</em></strong>.</p>
<p>That would be very telling to me, and a lot of other people on this thread.  </p>
<p>Thank you.  </p></p>

        <p><p>They aren't as controversial as here. The Clintons are more of a "fact of life". It's so odd to hear Haitians describe the foundations malpractice while shrugging. In Port-au-Prince, I've never met a Haitian who has had anything good to say about the Clintons. </p>
<p>I would say 80% disapprove. The rest either don't care, or are directly benefiting from their involvement. </p>
<p>You also need to understand that corruption is an old song in Haiti. </p></p>

        <p><p>Is voodoo no only a religion/belief system but also a drug/liquid/potion given to intoxicate/knockout people?  I believe B.Clinton referenced it as a drug-like substance somewhere.. </p></p>

        <p><p>Maybe you're talking about the Voodoo zombie stories? They give people a certain drink that makes them seem dead and they wake up a couple days later and their "master" continues to keep them groggy and drugged. At this point they will do ceremonies and satanic rituals. </p></p>

        <p><p>How is missing children handled in Haiti? Surely their families look for them, even if they are only a source of income. Are there any institutions that handle this?</p></p>

        <p><p>There's a number of foreign NGOs that handle things like this. The vast majority are very genuine and caring people. It's really a cultural problem. There is no family structure. So many babies are born bastards and out of wedlock so they are given away or abandoned. Oftentimes they are made to leave the house at a young age and do what they can to survive.</p></p>

        <p><p>So basically, these are unwanted accidental pregnancies. No one cares about these kids, they have no home to go to or parents that want anything to do with them.</p>
<p>No one is interested in adopting them. The monsters that take them in provide them with the only food, shelter they have ever known.</p>
<p>If they survive to adulthood, they grow up to be uneducated unskilled works adding to the burgeoning overpopulation of a desperately poor nation.</p>
<p>Im having a morality crisis here.</p>
<p>Because on some level I cant see this form of population control as really that terrible anymore. I can see where the politicians are coming from, because they are all for population control. </p></p>

        <p><p>It's a sad reality. And I totally agree, we need population control. What would the world be like if people only had a baby when they decided they wanted one? I'd like to believe our children would be happier and there'd be less shit like this happening.</p></p>

        <p><p>Circumstantial. Although, most of the podesta leads started out circumstantial and now look at it.
Florida is ripe with organizations like this. I would safely bet there are a dozen or more similar organizations in Fort Meyers alone.</p></p>

        <p><p>Similar to Love a Child. There are tons of orphanage outreaches in Florida and this one happens to be next to an FBI office. Who cares? You're grasping at nothing here.</p></p>
