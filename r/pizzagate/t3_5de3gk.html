        <strong>Freemasonry connection</strong>
        <p><p>Ok, not too much of a stretch here, seeing how things are going, but I saw a picture, either from Alefantis' Instagram, or from one of the connected "art" pages (maybe Kleinman), that was simply an end table with a couple of pictures and a copy of the movie "Being There".  Very out of place (compared to well, the other crap), but if you have seen the movie, it's no surprise.  The Masonry references abound, and I would LOVE to talk about the context of the movie given the light of the situation. If someone can post the pic in the thread, that would be helpful.  Regardless, I seent it, so there is another little nugget for everyone.</p></p>

        <p><p>Check out Gordy's Pickle jar, https://twitter.com/gordyspicklejar, their Instagram account commented on one of Alefantis Instagrams. Their logo is literally a masonic 'G'.</p></p>
