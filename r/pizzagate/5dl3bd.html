    By this I mean we should try to compile data in two forms.
   </p>
   <p>
    The first should be a Prologue to what we are doing. Child Trafficking, name of places, statistics of missing children, and KNOWN people who are involved and have been jailed for their actions.
   </p>
   <p>
    After providing those cold hard facts you can start getting into the dark side of it. The secondary part is introducing info to people such as DNC involvement, codewords that pedo's use, people who mysteriously decided to kill themselves when they were investigating it etc.
   </p>
   <p>
    If we compiled data like this, you can show people who are against Pedophilia the first part to get them involved and attentive for the bombshell you will lay on them with the second part.
   </p>
   <p>
    After they are aware of how serious missing children are, how it's increased, you can start to show them potential ties to the DNC, people who have been silenced and so forth. It's with my hope that if someone is able to set this up we can get more ears listening and demand answers from those who have refused to report on this.

    Great angle. It was the link to the woman who was taking the bus load of kids out of Haiti that really made me sit up and take notice because I already knew that story. I remembered it from when it first came out and when the connections to the Clintons and to people with known human trafficking ties it went from weird and suspicious to a smoking gun.
