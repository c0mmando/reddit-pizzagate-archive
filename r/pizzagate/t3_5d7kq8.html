        <strong>The Handkerchief Email Chain: Details are important to follow so we ask the right questions</strong>
        <p><p>Everyone should reread the handkerchief email.</p>
<p>The chain goes like this:</p>
<p>1) From Kathryn Tate to the Sandlers about looking at several vacationing homes in Marthas Vineyard. Also mentions a Steve and a Patty and that she's glad everyone was willing to squeeze into a car. Absolutely <em>no</em> mention of John Podesta.</p>

Here are links to the houses we drove by today located in Vineyard Haven. </p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> House at the end of the road to Lake Tashmoo at Kuffie's Point http://kendallmarthasvineyard.com/vacation-rentals/vineyard-haven/marthas-vineyard-vacation-rental.php?id=29 </p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> House along side Owen Park( the last one we drove to) Patty has never had anyone complain about noise from the town wharf or parking area. However, the VH Band does play on Sunday evenings inside the bandstand at the top of the street. It's on 3 floors. http://kendallmarthasvineyard.com/vacation-rentals/vineyard-haven/marthas-vineyard-vacation-rental.php?id=77 </p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> House across from the VH Yacht Club, which I feel the ceilings are too low for you and Steve, but Patty asked me to send along. http://kendallmarthasvineyard.com/vacation-rentals/vineyard-haven/marthas-vineyard-vacation-rental.php?id=12 </p>
<p>-
Here are links to the 3 houses in Chilmark </p>

3) The next day at 10AM, realtor Kathryn Tate inquires about a handkerchief she found on a kitchen island at the 'Field' house. She also inquires pillows the Sandlers apparently purchased and left behind.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>4) Mid afternoon on the same day, Susan Sandler sends an email to John Podesta inquiring about this handkerchief that has been found, suggesting it has a 'map' and seems 'pizza-related'. This is the email that would spark much of the controversy over much of the other pizza relate emails as it seems to imply that a code word is being used.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Its my understanding that Podesta was never on this trip through Marthas Vineyard. He was never included in the initial emails. The only reason for their existence in Podestas email is that the chain was forwarded to him by Susan Sandler during exchange #4.</p>
<p>Going down the road assuming that Podesta <em>was</em> with the Sandlers during September 1, 2014, we have to ask why he would be with them in the first place as he was Couselor To The President a the time. The Sandlers do support the Center for American Progress, Podestas former place of employment so there is a relationship there - it just seems strange.</p>
<p>Going down the road that he wasn't, how did his handkerchief get there? I'm left with the idea that the Sandlers viewed the properties in advance for a trip they were planning later so how did John Podesta's handerkerchief, who wasn't present with the object, arrive at this 'Field house'? Two possible scenarios come about.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Susan and Herbert Sandler, being all the way from California, possibly were offered a residence to stay for the evening. They invited some people up, did who knows what with John Podesta et al and he forgot his handkerchief on the kitchen island.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Susan and Herbert Sandler took a tour of the houses for a future stay in one of the residences, notified John Podesta and crew, they broke in, used the place for who knows what, cleaned it up and forgot his handkerchief.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With those two scenarios, #2 seems less plausible than #1 since we also have the bit of information that the Sandlers purchased pillows and apparently forgot those in this house as well.</p>
<p>There are more questions to ask here but I've seen this chain come up numerous time and people continue to make the same false assumptions about it without truly analyzing it.</p></p>

        <p><p>Thanks for posting this. Something I just noticed is the realtor says "white w/ black" and the Susan person tells Podesta it "has a pizza related map". What would make her say that from "white w/ black" being the description?</p>
<p>The "your" is spelled incorrectly. Is there any chance map was a typo...and if so what could it be instead? </p>
<p>Do you know if we have any follow up emails on what Susan told the realtor after Podesta's response?</p></p>

</blockquote>
<p>There's some handkerchief code they're refering to that's used in the pedo underworld ... I suppose.  I saw it somewhere on this sub.  I don't want to google all this stuff now because I'm at work but black = bondage/S&amp;M and White = underage.  That's the map.  So they communicate their "orders" for whatever their particular perversion is with the "map" on a handkerchief.  So they just say 'Has anyone found a yellow and red handkerchief, I believe I left it at X' and then the person will respond that they found 'their handkerchief' but in reality they're discussing sex trafficking. </p></p>

        <p><p>Oh yeah, I know that. Guess I didn't word that right. </p>
<p>I was more pointing to the fact that you have to know all that stuff to come to the conclusion of 'pizza related map'. No normal person would say that unless they KNEW what those words meant.</p>
<p>To add to it, how did she automatically know to contact Podesta, considering the realtor never said anything about pizza? </p>
<p>Side note just so things aren't lost in translation: the handkerchief code is an LGBT thing, not a pedo thing.</p></p>

        <p><p>White in said hankey code is mastrubation, either watching someone do it or having someone watch you do it. But here's something. A white with red or maroon or some shade of red stripes indicates that person is into blood or bloodletting. Alefantis posted an IG of handkerchiefs with red stripes. Mentioned something about them being 'gifts'</p></p>

        <p><p>I say this only in the hypothetical sense for discussion.  Do you think this email was listing a series of houses that were being "auditioned" for use by the Sandlers and Podesta for one of their rituals.  </p>
<p>Again, I'm not making a claim, just throwing this out there for discussion.  </p>
<p>A few things stand out to me:  </p>
<p>The email came in at 12:00 noon, which gave the Sandlers all day to consider the options.  The Sandlers would need some kind of visual reference for all the houses to show their fellow practitioners, and this email provided the links to all of the possible locations, without containing anything too incriminating.  </p>
<p>The Sandlers respond at 4:08pm thanking Realtor Kate for showing them around.  Plenty of time to have considered all the options with the other practitioners of the ritual.  </p>
<p>The references to each house are a bit weird.  In the first half from "Vineyard Haven" you have descriptions of each house which sounds harmless, but let's take a further look:  </p>
<p>THE HOUSES OF VINEYARD HAVEN:</p>
<p>1) House at the end of the road to Lake Tashmoo at Kuffie's Point.  (*Nothing incriminating here.  Perhaps this is meant to say that there would be no "issues" should they decide to conduct the ritual at this house.  It makes sense when you compare it to the next two emails)</p>
<p>2)  "House along side Owen Park( the last one we drove to) Patty has never had anyone complain about noise from the town wharf or parking area. However, the VH Band does play on Sunday evenings inside the bandstand at the top of the street. It's on 3 floors."  (*Here we see the realtor talking about "noise" from the street.  This could of course be a harmless reference to noise from the street that actually exists.  But I would venture to say that it is a coded message to the Sandlers to let them know that they would have to be careful about the noise and volume of the ritual here, lest they want to alert the neighbors.  Then Realtor Kate ends with "It's on 3 floors".  What is 'on' 3 floors?  Sounds like she is laying out the design of the ritual, which if they were to do it at this house, would be conducted on 3 floors of the house.  You don't say a house is "on 3 floors", you say it is "3 stories tall".  </p>
<p>3) "House across from the VH Yacht Club, which I feel the ceilings are too low for you and Steve, but Patty asked me to send along."  Here the realtor could possibly be pointing out yet another potential "disadvantage" of this location for hosting the ritual.  In the previous house it could have been a noise issue, here it could have been that the ceilings weren't tall enough to conduct the ritual in its "proper" setting.  </p>
<p>THE LINKS TO THE 3 HOUSES IN CHILMARK</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE:  In describing the 3 houses from Vineyard Haven, the realtor Kate Tate describes the physical attributes of each home.  In the houses from Chilmark, she describes the people or group who owned each home.  I am going to speculate the that the 3 Vineyard Haven homes were intended for the main ritual itself (hence the descriptions of what to watch out for like "noise" and "low ceilings"), and that the homes from Chilmark were a series of possible people/locations to host an "after party" event.  This starts to make sense when you read the email from Realtor Kathryn Tate to Susan Sandler, the next day 10/02 at 10:04AM, where she says "I just came <em>FROM CHECKING THE FIELD HOUSE</em> and I have a square cloth handkerchief (white w/ black) that was left on the kitchen island. Happy to send it via the mail if you let me know where I should send it.  This email is important because it implies a few things:  1) That Susan Sandler knew what the realtor meant by the "Field House".  If it was left behind at a random house, the description would have been something much less specific.  2) That she used the term "Field House".  A field house is defined as:  "Field house or fieldhouse is a common name for indoor sports arenas and stadiums, mostly used for college basketball, volleyball, or ice hockey. Additionally it is known to serve as a support building for various adjacent sports fields, i.e. locker room, team room, coaches' offices, etc."  Certainly a field house or 'stadium' would be a term worthy of such an occult ritual.  </p>
<p>Now back to the houses in Chilmark</p>
<p>1) "The first one owned by the Danish gentleman, Christian".  Why would it matter who owned the home, if The Sandlers were truly looking at vacation rentals?  Nobody who rents vacations homes needs or wants to meet the owners.  It is a transaction deal.  Here they could have been 'auditioning' The Danish gentlemen Christian. </p>
<p>2) "Squibnocket Associates".  If it wasn't odd enough listing off the owners of the vacation rentals already, why on earth would the Sandler's care about the real estate conglomerate "Squibnocket Associates" who owned the home?  I would venture to say that "Squibnocket Associates" was a powerful local group jockeying to host the 'after party'.  </p>
<p>3) "Jaffe House on Stonewall Beach and Pond"  Miles Jaffe the owner is the son of famous architect Norman Jaffe.  One might think the realtor is talking about this being a "Jaffe" designed home.  Except that it isn't.  It's merely the vacation home of Miles Jaffe.  Which brings me back to my point:  Why would the Sandlers care about who owned the home?  This could have been Miles Jaffe's 'audition'.  </p>
<p>Again, no proof here, but wanted to offer this for conversation.  Makes you wonder.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Thank you.  I like that we are continuing the dialogue to explore the truth, when our media is going 'full blackout'.  Reddit is killing it right now!  </p></p>

        <p><p>I think the more likely answer is this is all drug related. </p></p>

        <p><p>I think its worth leaving it open ended and why I also absolutely opposed any suggestion that this should have any reference to pedophilia in the catch name. Pizzagate is sort of a catch all name that works no matter what we are tracking because ultimately we have no definitive evidence fully suggesting that 'pizza' mean underage sex crimes. It could mean regular adult prostitution, it could be drugs, it could be some sort of corruption we haven't thought of. </p>
<p>The point of all of this isn't to prove that we have pedophiles in the top positions in our government. Its to expose the strange coded language they use and expose the illegal activities, whatever they may be, to the world.</p></p>
