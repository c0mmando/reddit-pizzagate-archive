        <strong>Eight pointed star</strong>
        <p><p>First off. You'll see the 8 pointed star everywhere, it's all over Eyes Wide Shut. Some of the stuff below applies. Look for that star when you research.</p>
<p>An owl will be another symbol</p>
<p>_--------</p>
<p>GUESS Who the 8-pointed Star stands for?
Sanat Kumara. SATAN! The Ascended Master…</p>
<p>Astaroth (also Ashtaroth, Astarot, and Asteroth), in demonology, is a Crowned Prince of Hell. He is a male figure named after the Canaanite goddess Ashtoreth. The name Astaroth was ultimately derived from that of 2nd millennium BC Phoenician goddess Astarte, an equivalent of the Babylonian Ishtar, and the earlier Sumerian Inanna.</p>
<p>demon</p>
<p>I believe this is the Ashtar of the Galactic Federation of Light-so-called ‘aliens’…demons in disguise.</p>
<p>I believe it (the demon) is a HERMAPHRODITE. Having Male &amp; Female parts! This is why the name covers so many avenues.</p>
<p>astarte</p>
<p>Ishtar (Isis, Astarte, Aphrodite, Inanna, Libertas, etc) is only one name for many personages.</p>
<p>Ashtar</p>
<p>Symbols like the 8-pointed star represents this figure. This entity is known as the EYE GODDESS, and she has EYE TEMPLES. Found were thousands of figurines with her staring wide, owl-like eyes which coiled like snakes.</p>
<p>_------------</p>
<p>Lilith /incubi and succubi are all connected to these symbols. The owl is a symbol of Lilith (Astarte, same root word as Easter) and Lilith is another face of this. I was working on a horror book and did a lot of research for it.... it all fits. </p>
<p>Hope it helps</p></p>

        <p><p>It does not stand for Satan</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ishtar is the Mesopotamian East Semitic(Akkadian, Assyrian and Babylonian) goddess of fertility, love, war, sex, and power [1] She is the counterpart to the earlier attestedSumerian Inanna, and the cognate for the later attested Northwest Semitic Aramean goddessAstarte, and the Armenian goddess Astghik.....
<strong>Besides the lions on her gate, her symbol is an eight-pointed star.[4]</strong></p>

        <p><p>Sanat Kumara is not Satan. Ashtar is not a demon, or evil.</p>
<p>Ashtar, Ishtar, Isis are of the same archetype and they have all been mis-represented to confuse people. They are all of the LIGHT and pure divine beings.</p>
<p>The geometry or star-designs are neither inherently good or bad, it's how they are used. Sacred Geometry is a science of harnessing energy through these basic structural templates. </p></p>

        <p><p>ok, so I'm not going to comment on the ethics or morality of spirit beings. IDGAF Sparky. This is about helping id evidence. I'm just explaining that from the USA/Western civilization's Judeo-Christian perspective, this stuff is Satanic because from an orthodox Christian or Jewish perspective all the gods were Satanic. All of those names lead back to this idea of the succubus and sex/children/sacrifice and you will see that shape on art associated with them.  To unravel the ideology of the pizzaLords (which is how I'll refer to them) you'd have to be one and I don't want inside their heads (which is why I stopped researching and writing my story) Extrapolating from what I've read about the Franklin cover up, Bohemian Grove (owl is everywhere) and Eyes Wide Shut If the current assumptions hold you have a cult that was syncretic and against or in opposition to Western culture i.e. Judeo-Christian ideas and beliefs. I'd start with the Theosophists and Rosicrucians if you were going to try to build an ideological framework. </p>
<p>More importantly? its all too plausible. For those that want to dismiss it, no. You can't if you know art history or anything about ancient ritual magic. I know a lot about both topics. </p></p>

        <p><p>That paragraph was a quote from someone else, but I c/p because it's late and I'm tired.  These pantheons have the same characters and different names. Astarte/Ishtar etc seems to be one being with different names like Jupiter and Zeus. I'm a Christian who has studied this stuff a lot and can tell you if they do actually buy any of this as faith? they might disagree with you. However you draw your own conclusions. Lucifer was the morning star. Lilith legend got confused with Astarte/succubi a long time ago. Shes mentioned once in isaiah.According to myth (not Bible)she gave birth to a horde of demons and would murder human children, jealous of Eve's offspring. It makes sense to me that the being would be the same as Astoreth and Lucifer. A hermaphrodite. It fits. Trust me the research into this isn't pleasant. Child sacrifice has always been part of the rituals. Always. Sacrifice of virgins meant children. Temple prostitution was common. </p>
<p>Just look for that star. </p>
<p>I'll dig out my notes and see if I come up w anything else later. I quit writing this story because it was too disturbing and now I'm freaked out because what I wrote and what I'm reading is eerily familiar.</p></p>

        <p><p>I read one thread where a marketing guy was talking about selling this to the MSM in a way they would accept. The reason you want to tie this stuff to Lilith if you must name names or be specific, is that she's already mainstream, (Lilith Fair) has ties to a fringy extreme sexually adventurous segment of US culture and leads exactly back to the sort of ritual abuse we suspect. Also, the term that MSM might accept would be "ritual" not "Satanic" because as so ably demonstrated here, if you start naming names then you have to deal with every pedantic religious zealot on the planet. Be general. Reference Stanley Kubrick. Call it ritual and symbolic. </p></p>
