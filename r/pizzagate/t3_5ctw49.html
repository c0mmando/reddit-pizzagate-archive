        <strong>Some thoughts from a PR person.</strong>
        <p><p>Hey guys, I've been following this story and am perplexed by what's being shared. All else aside, the Podesta emails and this Comet Ping Pong Pizza connection are glaring and inexplicable. </p>
<p>As a former PR person, current advertising professional, and someone who generally deals with the media a fair share, here are some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The term "Satanism" totally disarms your story.</strong> 
I'm not religious or superstitious. Even if you are, the religious significance of this story is unimportant. Keep the focus on the crimes being committed and these strange connections between powerful people - that's what the media cares about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The media doesn't research. They need to be fed the story.</strong> 
These guys at Gawker and Buzzfeed usually get paid by the click, so they're way better off cranking out 100 stories with provocative headlines than really digging into one. We're doing the research. We need to give them bite-sized, fully encapsulated, totally verifiable stories in infographics and our writing. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/283FJqV.png">This</a> is a great example of that type of content coming from this community, so kudos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintain connections to the big names that the media cares about.</strong> 
This Comet Pizza guy certainly seems like a key piece, but Podesta and Clinton are the names the media cares about. So again, when you're writing or creating images, consider rephrasing the narrative in a full way, even if most of us on this subreddit are already familiar with it. The less effort in writing and researching the content on the media's part, the easier it is to get picked up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope this is helpful. I'm watching this story, and I think there is clearly something here. I truly do hope we're all wrong for the sake of these children, but I truly think there's something to all of this. </p></p>

        <p><p>Solid advice. While I understand and agree that the Satanism/Occult stuff might cause people to instantly tune out, it actually is a significant piece of the puzzle. I really do believe that it is one of the reasons this world-wide pedo ring exists (along with assuring compliance with blackmail of top leaders).  </p></p>

        <p><p>I think its exceptionally important to point out. It could more correctly go by the term "occult" since we are not talking about literal Satanism per se as its defined in the mainstream. Occult is accurate because its a hidden methodology and its implications that it is about the worship of some malevolent force is also accurate.</p></p>

        <p><p>I mean nobody gets arrested for having weird religious beliefs. The crimes are what's important to their fate, and that's where real journalists will pay attention. </p></p>

        <p><p>My thinking is that if we ignore the SRA element of this all we end up doing is stopping 30 pedos running a pizza shop. Instead of stopping millions of them committing SRA going back millenia.  Its a big difference. If you guys are showing up SRA in your research, follow it. </p></p>

        <p><p>Moreso because their president was a straight up puppet for the occultists, but that had to literally get all the way to the Korean mainstream media until they started protesting. Whether or not we need to get this story to that point  or even further in the public eye; doesn't matter, we have to keep uncovering it until it's out there. </p></p>

<p>Edit: correcting myself. Ping pong w/ boy in a pizza bunker and flying in of pizzas and hotdogs are 2 separate events. </p></p>

I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in
pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long
ago, assume we are using the same channels? </p>

        <p><p>That's not at all a fair characterization of the situation. Her 'friend' could have been Shinto, Buddhist, Christian, anythng and the response would have been the same.</p>
<p>They're not protesting 'occult shamanism' they're protesting a secret takeover of government by 8 women who enriched themselves via corrupt charities while they controlled every element of President Park's life.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes indeed, and another factor - if we go along ignoring the symbolism and references to occult themes we stand a good chance of missing a lead because where you find occult practices among these people you will also find pedophilia if you dig deep enough.</p></p>

        <p><p>Should that not be reversed?</p>
<p>I feel like occultism follows pedophilia more then the opposite. I say this as someone who knows a lot of practicing witches, folklorists, and shamans.</p>
<p>The people who get into magic because they have sick desires tend to have very different praxes than those from more traditional routes.</p></p>

        <p><p>You can't really base their model off of what you see in average people practicing "witchcraft" and the like. First and foremost is their agenda and that is all wrapped up, tied up and founded on their religious belief system. It is not a thing you can "join", either..its generational. The generational aspect is what drives them to "initiate" their own children as infants. The pedophilia is a direct result of how they believe it is a critical element in gaining power through dark entities.</p></p>

        <p><p>This. This exactly. There is, unfortunately, no way to separate the two. It's a causational issue.</p></p>

        <p><p>So we can't separate <em>their</em> mysticism from <em>their</em> pedophilia. I get that. I wish we as a sub could separate <em>their</em> mysticism from normal occult practices. It feels weird to hear Luciferianism conflated with Satanism over and over again, to see people really whitewash over the finer points of difference and in doing so miss real connections in favor of spurious ones.</p></p>

        <p><p>Agreed, but it is interesting to look at the motive.  There is a lot of symbolism involved, and the religious beliefs explain the symbolism.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, Luciferianism is correct. It has varying forms that all lead to one goal/belief. We can liken that to denominations.</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree! </p>
<p>People accept that Satanism exists. The challenge is helping them understand that it exists beyond the occasional group of goth kids doing seances in the cemetery. </p>
<p>I believe that, instead of pointing out that it's a top down evil, we need to break it to them, gently, and into verifiable, bite-sized pieces; then scale it up gradually. For example: I recently exchanged comments with someone who was astonished and dismayed to see the vast collection of photos depicting Usain Bolt throwing Illuminati symbols. We are talking about tearing down almost every false idol that they currently worship.</p>
<p>We all know and accept that there are vicious street gangs who use blatant symbolism to communicate. We need a side-by-side illustration of a gangster and an Illuminati celebrity.</p>
<p>Which brings me to what I think is the most important point. The information needs to be incredibly dumbed-down for the general population. Ultimately, it will take someone like a former FOX News producer to package the information in a way that will reach those who can't or won't educate themselves. Good luck finding someone who isn't in on it, though... </p>
<p>We are talking about using truth as a weapon against mind control experts, who have a decades-long head start in brainwashing the populace. </p></p>

<p>Thanks. Religion isn't a priority angle of this story but it is a key, inherent aspect to those deeds and shouldn't be passed under silence at all unless you want to avoid certain backlashes.</p>
<p>I suspect OP is trying to stir the sleuthing community away from the target <em>because</em> it is so relevant and would lead you deeper and higher in your enquiries. </p>

        <p><p>Okay, I think people should understand what OP is saying about the Satanism aspect.</p>
<p>When people who haven't pored through the information like us hear "Satanist pedophiles," they dismiss ot instantly without looking at our evidence.</p>
<p>People are saying it's the most important aspect if the story, but here's the truth.</p>
<p>The single MOST IMPORTANT aspect of this story is MAKING SURE PEOPLE BELIEVE IT.</p>
<p>This is an unbelievable story even without the Occult aspect, and a lot of people just aren't going to want to hear it. Even with ironclad proof, we're going to have a lot of people choose to deny it.</p>
<p>I'm not saying don't research the occult aspect. I'm not saying don't mention it.</p>
<p>But frame the story around the pedophilia rings/human trafficking. We have to give this story traction with the common person before we can unfold every detail to the public.</p>
<p>When you see pizzagate on a major news network, or when someone is being prosecuted or investigated by the FBI over the evidence we've brought to light here, THEN we can reveal the occultism that weaves through every part of it.</p>
<p>OP isn't trying to say that Satanism or occultism isn't key, they're saying this news needs to spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>Be honest with yourself. This time last year, if you were on Facebook and you saw a news story, "Government leaders tied with Satanist Pedophilia Ring," you'd chuckle and move on. You probably wouldn't read it. You definitely wouldn't share it.</p>
<p>But if you saw the headline, "Government leaders tied to pedophilia ring/human trafficking" you would be far more likely to read and share it.</p>
<p>We need to think about how the uninitiated view it, because this is extremely delicate.</p>
<p>IF WE APPROACH THIS THE WRONG WAY, EVERYTHING COULD BE DISMISSED AND FORGOTTEN WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT!</p>
<p>And then everyone gets away with it, and we have to live our lives with this knowledge that this is happening and we had a chance to stop it, but we got too trigger happy too early and ruined everything.</p>
<p>Please be careful. Please be smart. Think about the most close-minded Clinton shill you know and try to think of how you would frame the story to convince them.</p>
<p>We will get to the Satanism aspect of it, but it has to have traction with the general public before you drop a bomb like that.</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree with you completely,  Many responses on here are defending the satanist/occult angle since it is important to motive in this story, but I do think no matter how true it is, it will cause people to not even bother looking.  It is literally the most ridiculous headline you can imagine "Hillary Clinton linked to satanic pedophile cult".  You file that right next to "Trump confirmed to be a reptilian alien from Zeta Reticuli".  </p>
<p>I think only because of the bigger profile cases being made (Epstein, the high profile rings in the UK if anyone here pays attention), only now is the typical American even considering Pedophilia rings.  Child Porn?  Sure, we all know that exists.  It is easy to access from the comfort of your computer chair.  But a child abusing ring? Completely different level.  </p>
<p>If you throw satanic rituals in there (even though the "spirit dinners" look completely viable), you risk losing immediate credibility, at least until people looked a little closer.  I like to consider myself somewhat objective, though a little conspiracy leaning, and I would never even both clicking on a link like that, it would go right past me until arrests were made.  </p></p>

        <p><p>So tough to say.  Obviously any time you are dealing with conspiracy, you have such a large spectrum of people.  You have the skeptics that will take the time to look but are hard to convince, the moderates, the "reachers" who want to believe anything (like Fox Mulder in X-files - I WANT TO BELIEVE), and the ones that take it waaaay too far.  I think it is too hard to tell whether you are dealing with a "reacher" or a shill but either way I try to take everything with a grain of salt.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Don't most people understand "cult" though, even if changing that just a bit to "Satanism" or "occult" makes it seem more sensational or harder to believe? I think its just about the way it gets explained. Get good at understanding and explaining this aspect in a way people can understand. I think that's the key.</p>
<p>"These pedophiles are involved in cult activity" rather than "these child molesters love the devil!"</p></p>

        <p><p>That's tone-policing. One thing gamergate taught us is it doesnt work, ruins our message and its effectiveness, changes our community for the worst, makes us lose our motivation and impetus. You're not running a PR campaign on this subreddit. You're digging. When you want to make a flyer then PR issues are relevant. When you dig and spread your findings, trying to play the political game takes you straight out of the enquiry one. Those are like oil and water, they dont mix well. Coming to this sub to say '"dont talk or look at this side of things" is just ruining the enquiry well.</p></p>

        <p><p>This has nothing to do with something as stupid as gamergate. This is about a worldwide child sex trafficking ring run by the most powerful people in the world.</p>
<p>This is an entirely different fucking ballpark.</p>
<p>People can keep digging and building a case, and NOTHING should be dismissed or ignored. I don't think we should cast aside the occultism aspect. That's still perfectly fine in this sub. But when it's presented to the general public, our number 1 job should be making sure they read the evidence, so they can lift the curtain for themselves, understand what's going on, then spread it to other people.</p>
<p>That's the only way all the work this subredddit is doing means anything.</p>
<p>It's not "tone-policing," it's presentation strategy.</p>
<p>You have to understand the consequences if we go about this the wrong way. Imagine that we get the ironclad, smoking gun evidence that can put these people away for life. We put together a detailed case, that's digestible and easy-to-follow. Then we send our case file to journalists around the country, we spread it on social media, we put it everywhere. The headline on our case file is, "Clinton, Obama, and other high-profile government officials tied to worldwide Satanist child sex trafficking cult."</p>
<p>Think about someone who hasn't been poring through the research. 2 months ago, I wouldn't even open that email. Especially if I was a journalist with real stories to cover. If I was in the mass population of reddit, I'd downvote it and move on. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN!</p>
<p>If that happens, we're responsible for thousands more children being sold into sex slavery. We let all these people go because we jumped the gun.</p>
<p>We should not dismiss the occultism aspect of it at all. I'm just saying, we should "bury the lead" so to speak when we give this info to people who haven't researched it, or they'll brush us off as tinfoil hat lunatics.</p>
<p>We need to prove the sex trafficking to them first before we start throwing the Occult aspect at them, or we lose everything. </p>
<p>You have to understand how precarious all this is. These people have been hiding in plain sight and getting away with it for <em>decades.</em> They're good at getting away. They know better than anyone how quickly the general public will dismiss the Occultism aspect of their dealings and they know how to frame the conversation so that's all people see.</p>
<p>Goddammit, we have to be careful. We have to be smart. We'll get everything out to the public, all of it. We'll reveal everything, but we have to do it with the right presentation if we want anyone to look further than the first line.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah I am not sure what OP's intentions are.  I should be nicer but I am just getting frustrated seeing multiple post downplaying the most important aspect.  I think the issue is a lot of people aren't ready to hear how fucked up things really are so downplaying the story is easier for them to digest ( cognitive dissonance ) and the average joe to digest they think.  Pizza gate is about to red pill the world.</p></p>

        <p><p>The "most important aspect" is getting this national attention.</p>
<p>That was OP's intention I believe.
A great example I could use is my friend's dad.  If I want to him saying I had info on a satanic cult pedoring he wouldn't even listen.</p>
<p>Whereas if I went to him saying I had strong evidence of a washington insider pedo ring (leaving the occult stuff out (for starters)) then he would listen.  The occult can be brought to their attention after. </p>
<p>Most normies are like him.  We need to sway them bit by bit not overwhelm them with omgwtf Clinton worships Moloch!  That's not going to convince them and just turn them off.</p></p>

        <p><p>According to some of the symbology (like in the abramovic blood paintings and Weird podesta hand picture) I heard and read that it points more to a worship of the Egyptian god Set? Correct me if I'm wrong. That probably falls under occult and not satanism. </p>
<p>I have seen how people react initially upon encountering the word satanic and maybe there's a sliver of truth in that it might be off-putting to others, especially to the young ones trying to learn more of this. Maybe we can stick to occult/WEGS (worship of Egyptian god set- just putting it out there) </p></p>

        <p><p>In their religion, the Egyptian gods are considered to be different aspects of Lucifer. For example, Isis represents Lucifer's feminine principle. That's also why they use the eye of Horus symbol. It's still satanism.</p></p>

<p>"The Statue of Liberty is thought by many scholars to be a thinly-veiled symbol of Isis -- the female aspect of Lucifer in this hidden religion."</p>
<p>The reason he refers to it as a "hidden religion" is that the "satanism" that you can find on the street where there are "satanic churches" and whatever isn't the religion that the elites have. The elites have the real stuff. So you probably won't find information like that asking around at your local church of satan.</p>
<p>To try to clarify this a little further, they don't actually believe that Isis is an actual, existing entity. If you read classic texts like Manly P. Hall's The Secret Teachings of All Ages, you learn that the initiated were taught the pagan gods were (usually) only symbolic aspects of God, nature, or the universe.</p>
<p>It's also worthwhile to note that the Egyptian religion was a positive and benign religion. Like many other benevolent symbols and teachings, the Egyptian pantheon was intentionally co-opted and subverted.</p></p>

        <p><p>no.  the cultists WANT those references on top.
it's a lot easier for a normie to dismiss all of this if the lede is "washington cultists pedo ring" rather than "washington human trafficking ring".
The cult stuff will come out later, but it's not what we need to go charging in with if we want anyone to take us seriously.</p></p>

        <p><p>I really don't think that its correct that they want this at the top. See the pedophilia is one of the sickest aspects of what their religion practices but they risk being discovered for a lot of other heinous crimes as well once the public has a grasp of what they really believe in its entirety.</p></p>

        <p><p>Agreed, but there is an <em>aspect</em> of PR here - the psychology - that if ignored will torpedo any effort to reach the public consciousness. You can't ignore it and just go balls deep truth on (most) people. They will simply dismiss it as crazy.</p></p>

        <p><p>If I were in charge of something conspiratorial I wanted to stay a secret, I'd dress it up with some phony Satanism. Makes it sound crazy to a normal person, keeps it within the realms of a run of the mill conspiracy theory that can safely be laughed off. Maybe you should take the emotions, moral panic, and your irrational religious beliefs out of this. </p></p>

        <p><p>I work in the same field. OP is completely right, though Satanic is indeed a part of the motivation for the crimes, it will invoke a lot of distance in the general population. As OP said, use the points that the general public and media outlets can latch onto. </p></p>

        <p><p>Look, that is the same exact crap that you PR types told investigators and similar in the Franklin Scandal, the Dutroux scandal, the Finders, etc, ad nauseum.  Forget about it.  People just have to wake the f up.</p></p>

        <p><p>Sorry, but I completely disagree!  I would agree if there wasn't a freaking MOUNTAIN OF PROOF of these crimes being global and endemic in the political and elite circles of gov't and industry.</p>
<p>Anyone who tries to dismiss the Satanist aspect of this, needs to get off their a$$es and read the mountain of evidence about the Dutroux Scandal, the Jimmy Savile affair, the Franklin Scandal, the Sandusky Scandal, the Presidio Scandal, the Finders in Tallahassee, <em>AND</em> all the people who have mysteriously died/been murdered who have researched these crimes.  And that doesn't even get into the many crimes perped by the Roman Catholic Church.  Did you know that until 2013, that the age of consent in the Vatican was 12 years old?  Tell us, please, how ANYONE in the Vatican, with supposedly priests who don't have sex, needs to have an age of consent law?  And heck, why was it 'raised', when it supposedly doesn't exist?  You need to understand how <em>pervasive</em> this is!</p>
<p>If you just look at the above scandals, you are including the royal families of Europe, the highest levels of NATO and the British gov'ts.  The highest levels of US industry and the US Gov't, all levels of the US education system, many state Child Protective Services...I mean, what's left?  What part of the world and society today is NOT permeated by pedophiles and satanists?</p>
<p>So sorry, your post is an example of someone who has NOT investigated this, and does NOT UNDERSTAND that the whole pedophilia and child trafficking that is going on IS CLOSELY ALIGNED with Satanism. You can't just remove one from the other in this case--that's exactly why it has been able to continue on from scandal to scandal.  If you don't believe that, then you haven't spent 20 freaking minutes looking into the past crimes I mention.</p>
<p>So, as a 'PR person', what you <em>SHOULD</em> be focusing on is how to bring the Satanism part out in a way that people can understand the reality of it.  Hiding it or ignoring it is EXACTLY why we keep going form one scandal to the next!</p>
<p>SMH.</p>

        <p><p>He's not saying the Satanism part isn't key to all this, he's saying the story needs to be accessible to journalists and the general public.</p>
<p>If we want people to open the story and read it and see the evidence for themselves, then we can't headline with "Government officials tied to Satanist Pedophilia Ring"</p>
<p>A year ago, you wouldn't have opened that story,  because it sounds crazy. It's real, it's fact and we know that now, but if we want people to read the mountains of evidence, then we can't let them dismiss the story before they even open it.</p>
<p>OP isn't trying to dismiss that aspect, he's trying to explain how to push the story out to the public without it being laughed away.</p>
<p>If we approach this the wrong way, then everything we're discovering could be brushed away before anyone looks at the first piece of evidence.</p>
<p>You can't force people to open their eyes to the ugliest part of humanity that's ever existed. We have to get them to open their own eyes.</p>
<p>We will absolutely bring out the occultism aspect that ties all of this together, but we have to do it once people have already swallowed the pill.</p>
<p>Morpheus didn't tell Neo the world was run by machines until after he took the pill. He would have walked away without taking either.</p>
<p>Please let's be smart about how we present this information. I don't want to lose everything because we revealed the hardest aspect to believe too early on, and scared the average person away.</p></p>

        <p><p>Look, I completely understand what was said.  It's just wrong, IMO.  I've researched too many of these investigations to think differently.</p>
<p>Here's how it's worked in the past.  Big scandal.  Committees created to 'investigate'.  Perhaps a hard-hitting investigator is found.  If so, he's dead.  Next investigator. Prosecutor is ALWAYS already in the pocket of these criminals...that's why they are located where they are located!  Usually, local FBI office and police depts are also infiltrated.  All it takes is the police chief, and one or two other officers, like the spokesman, or lead investigator.</p>
<p>Witnesses mention Satanism along with the child trafficking.  Immediately, the local media, who are also being told what to print, manipulate the public writing articles making fun and dismissing the whole thing, because, well, satanism?  Really?  In cases where the satanism was NOT mentioned, guess what happens? The media, print it anyway...because their goal is to discredit the investigation!  It really doesn't matter if you do or don't do.</p>
<p>The fact is, the way to go about investigating and publicizing this is to release undismissable FACTS about previous investigations, and their coverups.  Dribble it out like Wikileaks did.  Just take the Franklin scandal as one example (though I could give more, it's really a textbook example of how they work to cover this shit up)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Rumors had been around for years about pedophilia and satanic stuff going on in Omaha, NE.  Numerous witnesses go to the cops, including Child Service personnel, and victims. They are all ignored.  Why?  The police CHIEF is involved in the pedo/satanic group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank fails.  Turns out the person running bank is also accused of being involved in pedo.  Story breaks out, because it can no longer be ignored.  FBI gets involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Main witnesses are all children (of course!). They are systemically harassed, threatened, have their families threatened by both the police AND the FBI.  One teen girl, Alicia Owen is told to change her story or she will be charged with a crime.  She refuses.  Railroaded by flawed grand jury into trial, then all the other witnesses are ignored by the prosecutors and defense counsels.  She gets 11 years for PERJURY!  And guess who she had accused?  The police chief had gotten her pregnant after raping her.  The prosecutor is dirty, the judge is dirty.  Both end up being rewarded and are in high positions in the fed gov't today.  the prosecutor is now a federal district judge.  The judge was given a plum job in a corp.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The PUBLISHER of the only paper in town was involved and named in the investigation. Also one of their most popular reporters.  All of this was easily covered up, because, well, you know.  They DO own the paper!  But the local television and radio stations also denigrated or ignored the evidence.  </p>
<p>But here's the thing.  All of the above was before the internet age. Look at the Jimmy Savile scandal as an example. Now, TPTB have also covered this up, so far, but everyone knows about Jimmy Savile and the fact he was a high-level wizard and heavily involved with the royals.</p>
<p>And what are TPTB doing?  Well, gee, they created a 'committee', to investigate this.  The first THREE!!(??!!) people they put in charge of said committee, were outed as friends of the accused.  The fourth quit after 3 months on the job.  Three years later, and absolutely nothing is happening.  Obviously TPTB in England are hoping that people just 'forget' about it.  I don't think that's going to happen, because these people are incapable of stopping what they do, and inevitably, more scandals come out.</p>
<p>So, IMO, you have to hit and hit hard!  Don't hold back any of the evidence, but only publish what can be proven.  Be ready with examples in past investigations that show these things to be true. Use alternative media to get out the story that the mainstream wants to bury.</p>
<p>But sorry, trying to manage how horrible these crimes are is not going to get it done.  Been there, tried that, and the media will do ANYTHING to discredit ANY investigation.  Just look at the reactions of the Post, Times and similar to the Franklin Scandal.  It's reprehensible.  But it shows how endemic satanism is.</p></p>

        <p><p>There's a lot that disarms this story. Violating journalistic ethics is one. I agree w/OP. HuffPo &amp; some of Gannett is paid by traffic. Agree w/OP on the example, it shows a verified abducted child. When you go down a wrong path, you need to limit that progress. The community is fractured, and just like the Japanese in WW2, there can be men working alone on an island that are totally disconnected from reality. </p></p>

        <p><p>Occult rituals are real to those that believe - it is not a conspiracy that people DO take part in rituals and worship evil </p>
<p>no different than a Christian who worships christ - so it's not a stretch</p>
<p>there IS however a LOT of evidence to show that several people in this group have a strong Occult interest... </p></p>

        <p><p>Some ideas from a person who lives in the art world:</p>
<p>Do your research on performance art. What Marina Abramovic does isn't really that weird (for a performance artist). Compare that to Cosey Fanni Tutti for example. People familiar with this kind of art won't take you seriously if you obviously have no clue about what they do, particularly when someone thinks it's about Satanism.</p>
<p>Also check out the musicians you're connecting with this. Prince Rama on that one poster? Come on... Some artists use weird imagery because they like weird imagery. Just like some people play CS without actually killing people in real life. Or watch scary movies.</p>
<p>Then there's that video where someone with a weird voice talks about putting a baby down. This is very likely from some drag standup / burlesque show and in that context really not so creepy. Tasteless? Maybe. Maybe that's the comedian's thing. But I doubt it's serious.</p>
<p>Conclusion: It's great that you do all that research and some things really sound fishy, but art people will laugh at you for never getting out of your basements if you get scared by relatively normal art.</p></p>

        <p><p>When I discuss this topic, I usually refer to them as pedophiles and I do not get into the gory details. But then after introducing the topic, I will mention that this pedophile cult is also satanic. I think it is an important detail and it lets people know there are ceremonies, rituals, cannibalism, murder, mind control, power structures, secret pregnancies, signs, symbols, etc, without actually having to lay it all out in horrific detail or promote their agenda. </p>
<p>I have a friend who objected to me referring to them as satanic, she sees satanism as somewhat benign. I told her those folks were going to have to find a new name. I think it pissed her off to hear me say that, but it is true. Once this is all out in the public, the idea of innocent satanists will fully evaporate. No one will want to pretend to be one of them. The innocent satanists who do NOT do that horrific stuff to children or animals, are going to have to find a new name for themselves when the really horrific satanists fully come out to the closet. Fact of life. There is no point in fighting against it, unless of course they want to support them. There are a lot of brainwashed folks in the world. </p>
<p>One more important point I want to make, many of their victims here in the US are non-white. People with no legal status can not complain when their children are stolen from them. Who is going to listen to them? Missing children are not even counted by the FBI. We have very sick people running this country and they are purposely making it hard for immigrants to become legalized. Why? Because legal people have legal rights. "Illegals" are the perfect victims of these crimes. The pedophiles in government create the immigration problems on purpose in order to have a steady supply of little children to use in their 'ceremonies' and parties. Yes, they are that evil. </p>
<p>Our country is run by these pedophiles. ALL of their policies including banking, medical care, war and immigration should be considered in that light. This is a very serious problem for ALL of us. It corrupts just about everything, including our schools and our police. It is truly terrifying. </p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>The term "Satanism" totally disarms your story. I'm not religious or superstitious. Even if you are, the religious significance of this story is unimportant. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>False. If you have any religious belief (barring Judaism that "doesnt believe in Satan"), Satanism is a major red flag.</p>
<p>It is, on top of that, inherently important to this story. Those people are not just cannibals, child molestors whom are bragging about it on social media. It goes deeper and we already know where it goes if we have any interest for the occult and conspiracies because it's always the same shit.</p>

        <p><p>You have no clue 'what it is'.  So stop acting like you're some kind of expert.  If you looked into the many scandals I mention above, you can't conclude anything BUT it is an organized cabal that includes mind control, child trafficking, child abuse, murder and satan worship.  Pray tell, what do YOU call that religion, eh?</p>
<p>To most rational people in the world, that is the textbook definition of Satanism.  Cripes.  Just take a look at the Lucis Trust.  A part of the UN since inception, and supposedly responsible for the printing of ALL UN documents.  They are also one of the rare institutions that has 'Observer' status in the UN.</p>
<p>Well, guess what the original name of the Lucis Trust is?  The LUCIFER TRUST.  Go to lucistrust.org and see for yourself.  I'm telling you people this is endemic.  It truly is the mother of all conspiracies and it's all freaking real.  I did not want to believe this 6 years ago when I first started researching what was really going on around me...but the evidence is undeniable when you look at the Franklin Scandal, the Presidio Scandal, the Finders, the Dutroux Scandal, the Jimmy Savile affair, the Jeffrey Epstein and Lolita Express Scandal--and that's just off the top of my head!  All levels of US, British and European gov'ts!  Royal families!  Heads of state!(Check out Edward Heath and his outing as a pedophile, for just ONE example), leaders of industry (look at Warren Buffet's involvement in the Franklin Scandal).</p>
<p>You all need to WTFU.</p></p>

        <p><p>One more thing you need to understand: Of course not all of these creeps that are caught up in these nefarious and evil activities are Satanists.  If you read the above scandals there's one thing you will see permeating ALL of them--the organized and systemic blackmail of politicians, using male and female prostitutes, honey pots, and yes, children by elements of the Secret Service (Franklin Scandal...read a book titles 'confessions of a dc madam' among others), FBI (Franklin Scandal, Sandusky Scandal, the Finders), CIA (Finders, Franklin Scandal), Mossad, MI6--heck almost <em>all</em> the intelligence agencies are involved in some way. An irrefutable fact if you look into the scandals.</p></p>

Can't believe I missed the satanist angle this whole time.</p></p>

        <p><p>God damnit. The NWO are openly decalring the devil as their God in the global media for some decades now.  There are celebrities leading everyone to give their souls to the devil, making open declarations that they gave their souls to the devil - who are engaged in sacrificial ceremonies (of you) on god damn MTV right now.  They are actually telling us blatantly what they are doing to us and what is coming.  The vatican has just declared lucifer enthroned at the vatican.  The God damn satanist mob are doing their own PR about this shit using the mainstream media and how great it is to let demons posess you because you get lots of candy. </p>
<p>The reality is that there are god damn occult satanist abducting, torturing and eating children on an industrial scale for god damn hundreds or possibly thousands of years.  For their sake we end up on the defensive for saying such uncomfortable things for people to hear.  WAKE THE FUCK UP. Jimmy Saville was shouting "hail satan" as he was raping chidren and dead bodies.  This is confirmed fact.  You would think that this has something to do with satanism, these bastards would have us believe the children made that shit up.  Fuck public relations. At what point are we going to be able to discuss this shit without someone saying we are being politically incorrect or insulting to a god damn demographic and should worry about what people will think.</p>
<p>How much time do we waste on this back talking shit.  We know because we researched the evidence. Its overwhelming. Half the time people spend back talking and talking shit,  This thread is just one more tieing up how many people apologising for upsetting someones delicate sensibilities and trying gently to explain the detail of this horrific shitstorm. When this breaks it wont come from us. It will be a guy with stars on his shoulders a Judge with a really big hammer and the lamestream media and is about to eat this giant shitstorm wether people like the way it is worded or not. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, what's weird is that they specifically try to rationalize their name, instead of just changing it again.  And I mentioned this on another conspiracy forum and the shills came out of the woodwork with the 'lucifer is not satan' stuff.  </p>
<p>Well, it really doesn't matter if Lucifer is or is not Satan.  They both dishonor Jesus and everything Jesus stood for.  And I'm not some Jesus freak or anything.  In fact I was agnostic until about year 4 of my rabbit hole travels.  </p>
<p>That's when I realized that even if I did not believe in Satan, these people absolutely did, and when one looks at the world today, you can conclude nothing other than 'this world is run by Satan', just as Jesus Christ said.  From that day forward I've been doing a lot of research on ancient history and the Akarshic (sp?) records.</p>
<p>And I now personally believe that Jesus is the secret to happiness in this world. Of course, I also think that if one follows certain other religions faithfully, like Buddhism, etc, that you are accomplishing the same thing.</p></p>

        <p><p>The problem with a lot of angry answers here is they're in denial. OP is right. </p>
<p><strong>Even if journalist are lazy, you can't force them to do their jobs. You can only accept it's what you should expect and deal with it.</strong> You don't know, some could have receive death threats, some could fear for their family too and that's why they aren't doing their jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding satanism, call it cult or sect.</strong> Saying "satanism" is not even right anyway and a bit ignorant since there's lot of branches of satanism and not everything revolves around christian faith.</p>
<p>Find what cult it really is instead (OTO, Thelema, Theocracy, wicca, etc.) and until then call it a cult or something. </p>
<p>Think of it as people constantly using "racism" or "feminism" to describe anything that looks like it but isn't! It surely pisses you all and you simply shut down whenever someone mention it. Same goes for satanism.</p></p>

        <p><p>I appreciate your post but I think at this point, there's not really any reason to start bringing this to any media. There are very little concrete facts but many, many leads that need to be investigated further. It will take time before there is relevant enough <em>factual</em> information to form a structured timeline and an outline for key players. </p>
<p>As for the Satanism disarming the story, the whole story is disarming. The fact that it may be the case that there are child trafficking rings that involve people from the highest echelons of government and business is already outrageous to pretty much everyone. If the Satanism angle is part of the story, it should be included. </p></p>

        <p><p>Actually, that's not true.  Perhaps it is in THIS scandal, but when you add all these scandals up, that were IGNORED PURPOSELY by the criminal mainstream, there is more than enough evidence of child trafficking and rape and murder going on to put numerous people in prison, if they just INVESTIGATED or reopened the investigations, with HONEST, BRAVE prosecutors.</p>
<p>Therein lies the problem--most prosecutors care about one thing--their political careers, and do not want to get involved in such things--especially when it involves the people they surround themselves with (ie, other politicians!).</p>
<p>There is a TON of evidence in the Franklin Scandal. Elements of the FBI PURPOSEDLY destroyed, harassed and threatened the victims.  There is a TON of evidence in the Finders--but the DC and Tallahassee cops were CALLED OFF THE INVESTIGATION BECAUSE, well, 'national security' you know!</p>
<p>I could go on--what we need are REAL investigations, with REAL investigators, who aren't corrupt, or cowards.</p></p>

        <p><p>Comet Pizza is a ping-pong/pizza business in the DC area frequented by political figures and run by a man who is on the top 50 most powerful people of DC - James Alefantis. Connections have been made between this establishment and a pedophilia trafficking network that includes Podesta and the Clinton Foundation.</p></p>

        <p><p>And blackmailed his former boyfriend David Brock to the tune of 850k and a new house.  Brock runs Media Matters.  Which is a Soros funded operation.
Soros is on record having donated at least 11k to Comet Pizza.
There's a shitton more but that should get you going...</p></p>

        <p><p>It's true we should focus on the Clinton's/Podesta, but Jimmy &amp; these other businesses are connected. Clinton's team probably has no trouble cleaning up the tracks the Clintons leave behind. But these arrogant "lesser known" people don't have that &amp; are leaving behind bread loafs of clues. </p>
<p>Most connections we are making to Clinton came from these random smaller connected people</p></p>

        <p><p>Totally agree with OP. You marginalize yourselves by representing this as being about Satanism. Maybe you guys are too young to remember the Satanic Panic from the mid-eighties through early-nineties but it was thoroughly debunked and left a lot of people with egg on their faces. Especially those in the media who championed that muck. Oh yeah, pedophilia was always involved too. Ritual sacrifice and eating babies was big. It was all horseshit of the highest order.</p>
<p>Religious simpletons will always label crime, especially crimes of the flesh or those committed by youths, as being inspired by Satan.</p>
<p>I personally worship the Dark Lord. I don't eat babies. The shots gross cuz and repugnant. What I would do is eateth fruit from the tree of knowledge and believe in science. Heresy to the church, ya dig.</p>
<p>What is Satanism to ye' anyway? Define it. What you all are calling Satanism is basically what was described in Christian dogma from the dark ages. Christians, by definition, are essentially Satanists to the heebrew. They say Jesus Christ is boiling in a pot of doodoo in Hell for all of eternity.</p>
<p>Not for nothing, this Satanism path you're on is one of futility. Follow the path that leads to the pedophile ring. First things first, find a victim or a witness who can substantiate any of this. </p></p>

        <p><p>I agree with the satanic panic comparisons. There was the group of teenagers who got convicted of murder because of the music they listened to and the way they looked. Then there was the PMRC and the senate hearing bullshit. They tried to connect all these musicians with satanic imagery, blood, violence, sex, self mutilation, torture, ect. It was an absolute joke. Dungeons &amp; Dragons was also being targeted by people. People eventually realized they were barking up the wrong tree</p>
<p>I keep reading responses that say "but there's evidence this is actually going on, if it's the truth it needs to be uncovered" type of stuff. Let's just say for this example that every satanic accusation is true. They really are performing dark rituals. Drinking blood. The whole nine yards. Personally, when I started seeing satanic accusations recently, like the spirit cooking thing, I just laughed at it and immediately dismissed it.</p>
<p>If I did a quick search on satanic ritual abuse, I would find that it is one of the most frequently used examples of "moral panic". Then maybe I would click on the wikipedia page for SRA and find something like this </p>
<p>"Official investigations produced no evidence of widespread conspiracies or of the slaughter of thousands; only a small number of verified crimes have even remote similarities to tales of SRA. In the latter half of the 1990s, interest in SRA declined and skepticism became the default position, <em>with very few researchers giving any credence to the existence of SRA.</em>" </p>
<p>This is not a good start for getting me to believe this. It not longer looks like you're trying to present them a group of sick pedophiles, but as actual science fiction movie villians, where they suck out the souls of other people to gain power.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well said.</p>
<p>Satanism is simply what the moral marjority, religious right, or, in days gone by, tabloid journalism calls anything it doesn't understand or can't explain. Like electricity. Or women in britches.</p>
<p>If you want to stop this investigation dead in its tracks, keep focusing on Satanism and Madeleine McCann. Both of those roads will surely lead to marginalization and mockery.</p>
<p>May I suggest something? It's hard for American youth to understand but it's not all about you and what you think is right or applicable; it's about what is most effective in achieving your goals.</p></p>

        <p><p>Language, framing, spin etc. are extremely important when communicating through the media. I think sticking with 'occult' is the correct term - which conjures images of creepy ritual and sacrifice etc. and has connotations with cult which people already aassociate with brainwashing/programming techniques. </p>
<p>I beleieve it serves an attraction for dark-minded individuals and a bridge to the criminal activities: pedophilia, rape, torture, murder and cannabilism which then becomes a very good control/blackmailing mechanism. Psychopaths to govern the plebs allows the real "powers that be" to push through their harsher agenda.</p>
<p>At the moment people are still researching, gathering data and widening the potential network. Until there is more concrete evidence the PR spin doctors should work on presenting the confirmed information.</p>
<p>Reinforcing past cases also serves to heighten public awareness. There are well known global cases: Belgium, UK and Australia with links to the highest officials, businessmen and celebs.</p></p>

        <p><p>First of all no one denies mind control or its government use. That's been public information since the 70's. Secondly, i am a ritual abuse survivor. To say thousands of people like me don't exist or that it doesn't happen is ridiculous.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't get where you come to the conclusion that is wasn't successful unless it's simply the government not confirming it. They also destroyed more than half the documents involved. Do you also trust that the government wouldn't be involved in pedophilia? How about ask the survivors who testified against the government if their shit worked.</p></p>
