    Wait! Before you shoot me, that's not me saying that stuff.
   </p>
   <p>
    That is what people in the near future will be saying.

   <p>
    Yes, there is a movement under way to start normalizing pedophilia. Think of it as advanced SJW conditioning.
   </p>
   <p>
    Propaganda rag Salon has been pushing it already. Been under way for about a year now. This went viral when it was published, but I'm providing it here in case you missed it.
   </p>
   <p>
    You can watch the video with "Todd" (he's even got the pedo look) and how he is such a victim for liking little girls.

    This is the world we live in. Keep fighting the good fight.

    Most paedophiles were also abused children
(http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/179/6/482)
   </p>
   <p>
    So it's perfectly possible that in a better world paedophiles could get help not act out their impulses (created by their own childhood abuse) and not be treated inhumanely.
   </p>
   <p>
    SJW is all about consent. So no not in a million years would the rape of children be justified by earnest SJWs. Im sure if you are honest with yourself you know that. Sounds like you are trying to derail this sub with a meaningless rant. Stay focused.

    I've been seeing this pattern and link to the same article or whatever.

    I would be careful with this, guys. I guess u/Filmpolice was just modded. Take care with this one.

    They already are. I remember seeing an article on facebook that felt like they were trying to push the narrative that there is a difference between pedos that love the kids and pedos that rape and hurt the kids. Like we are supposed to feel ok because that's just the way they are and that's how the show their love. Disgusting. And this was months before I found out about all of this stuff.

    No. The crowd pushing for this is small. Even Tumblr's staunchest SJWs (especially Tumblr's staunchest SJWs) hate pedos.
