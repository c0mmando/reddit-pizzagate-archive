        <strong>IHOHQ THREAD</strong>
        <p><p>If you guys haven't seen this yet, it is a strange, to say the least, website linked to Tamera Luzzato, a woman mentioned in the podesta emails for her granddaughters being "entertainement" to podesta.  This site is linked to her and here is a thread with more info on it.</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dfiek/master_thread_pizzagate_needs_to_delve_more/da4hqro/</p>
<p>I have been searching through the site and I have found some horribly creepy things</p>
<p>Here is a link to videos.  They are NSFW.  Do not watch it you are squeamish.  I will continue to update this thread with everything that is found there</p>

        <p><p>This seems like a troll or a red herring. What purpose would this stupid shit serve?</p></p>

        <p><p>By red herring I meant an intentionally misleading clue that is almost certainly going to prove to be a waste of time.</p>
<p>I'm sure this has been addressed somewhere but where's the proof that this Luzzato woman made the site?</p></p>
