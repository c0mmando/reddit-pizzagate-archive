   <strong>
    One comprehensive #Pizzagate summary
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I've been on this trail since the start and there's a lot of important stuff we've all found, but there's too many summaries imo. Some of these comprehensive summaries jump into the middle of the story as well.
   </p>
   <p>
    There should be one that starts from the beginning, and that beginning—imho—should start with the Podesta email with pizza party invitation attached.  That attachment led a lot of us down the rabbit hole because of the CPPP logo on it.
   </p>
   <p>
    This way any lay-person can follow along just like a lot of us did in finding all this information.

    I thought of making a video.
I thought of writing a speech.
Then I remembered, I enjoy writing.
Today I decided that I'm going to start writing an essay, titled "Why Losing the Pizza Gate Battle Signifies the Defeat of Mankind."

    Do what you're best at in order to save these children. Some of the videos out there, by talented heroes, are fantastic. I'm sure there are more to come.

    I've been working on something similar to this. Intended goal is something you could give your parents,grandparents, boss, teachers, etc to raise awareness and not be dismissed as a "conspiracy theorist". It's taking a lot longer than I thought it would though. I stepped on my laptop last night and that's also further complicating things.
