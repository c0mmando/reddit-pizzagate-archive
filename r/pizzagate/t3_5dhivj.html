<strong>Clinton's Brunei Connection - "a pedophile sultan"</strong>
<p><p>While I think Haiti should be the focus, I'd like to put this in here for reference. Do not waste time on looking this up while there are major leads on haiti. There are some interesting tidbits, however.</p>
<p>Also, these sources aren't what would strike me as very reliable, but can probably be traced a bit better.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Brunei has obvious connections to the Clintons, the sultan/Brunei is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation:
Source: https://www.lifezette.com/polizette/clintons-brunei-connection/</p>
<p>The sultan has some controversial stories surrounding him. Roger Stone and Robert Mollow's 'The Clinton's war on women' covers Brunei, namely</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The identities of Clinton Presidential Library's multi-million dollar donors, such as the Sultan of Brunei, a pedophile sultan, who maintains an under-age harem of girls in the country he rules, regimes who oppress women and even a convicted sex criminal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather curious how this under-age harem of a major CF donator looks like.</p>
<p>Source: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/37446</p>
<p>The "convicted" part is unclear, but:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1997, he was sued by a former Miss USA who said she was held as a sex slave, drugged, and molested by Brunei’s royal family. The lawsuit was dropped after the Sultan and his brother claimed diplomatic immunity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some other source claims that the lawsuit was settled out of court; I would <em>not</em> be surprised if they wanted to avoid a story about paying the alleged victim off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sultan and his brother Prince Jefri have become “infamous for their sex parties and their harems composed mainly of underage girls.”"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>http://freebeacon.com/politics/the-clintons-and-the-sultan-of-brunei-have-a-history/</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, in the abovementioned article it says that Billy Clinton travelled to Brunei on ~~first class~~ The Lolita express:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clinton would return to Brunei that same year—this time without his daughter.
Clinton was picked up at a Japanese naval base by Jeffrey Epstein and his private Boeing 727—known to many as either “the orgy jet” or “Lolita Express”—and flown to Brunei to visit with Sultan Bolkiah, according to flight records.*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently unable to find anything on Wikileaks, but the Sultan seems to be a rather big fish. "Sultan" might be an appropiate search term, there aren't many left. Sultan of Oman, Sultan of Brunei... and the self-titled <em>Sultan of Flat</em> - Mr. Podesta himself (not a joke, check Wikileaks).</p>
<p>The reason I think it's <em>very</em> interesting is that the Sultan, according to the articles, have an affinity for rather young girls, that may or may not be from Brunei. </p>
<h1>Are "his" girls from the US?</h1>
<p>In case you need more tinfoil, I was curious why Wikileaks had all their folders except the intelligence people database at 01/01-1984, and failed to find any computer-related explanation. Brunei got independent at that date, and seemed like the most likely "hidden message", if they intended it to be one.</p>
<p>I'll shoot down myself, though: It's probably a computer-related explanation or an inside-joke of "1984", not something meant to lead us on.</p>
<p>I'd finally like to point out what FBIanon said:</p>
<h1>FOLLOW THE MONEY</h1>
<p>^Edit ^1: National Enquirer has a moved/removed (?) article with a couple of interesting details. Not able to have Archive.is process it - yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their entourage included Ghislaine Maxwell and Sarah Kellen – both alleged “madames” for Epstein’s kiddie sex ring.</p>
<p>Bill flew to visit Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah – who’d relied on Clinton-era diplomatic immunity to beat charges of holding an American beauty queen against her will.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>^Edit ^2: So, the diplomatic immunity of the Sultan had to be determined in court... but maybe he had it all along as a head of state?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(...) because in August 1997 Judge Consuelo Marshall, a Los Angeles Fedral judge, ruled that the Sultan of Brunei is entitled to diplomatic immunity since he is a head of state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the book questions Marketic's motives. It appears that she was offered a very well-paid job with a "non-descriptive", yet suggestive (?) title.</p>
<p>https://books.google.no/books?id=y7yjRlwg8agC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;lpg=PA162&amp;dq=sultan+of+brunei+diplomatic+immunity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A5NOLpQJEa&amp;sig=uQ2mXnYKkUpcdW1-UUDwiQS1a-E&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQzqPo3LDQAhUH1iwKHeepCjEQ6AEIPjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=sultan%20of%20brunei%20diplomatic%20immunity&amp;f=false</p>
<p>^Edit ^3:</p>
<p>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/so-whos-telling-lies-the-swinging-sultan-or-the-white-slave-beauty-1260898.html</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if the Sultan is dropped from the list of defendants, Miss Marketic may still pursue her case against the Kaliber Talent Agency, which, she alleges, procured girls from across the US. Kaliber has not, so far, denied that the Sultanate was its client, but it claims it is protected by a clause in her contract binding the parties in any dispute to outside arbitration, and not the courts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>~~I really doubt that anything else than semi-shady operations would be conducted in this way, but gonna look into Kaliber, simply because the spelling makes it really easy to find.~~ Only mentions of "Kaliber" is in the next edit (and German for "Calibre"). They also seem to have changed their name following the Marketic affair. They were LA based, FWIW.</p>
<p>^Edit ^4:</p>
<p>The following cable is a request for immunity for the Sultan etc, referencing that it was done for the Marketic case (as well as other heads of state).</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06BANDARSERIBEGAWAN499_a.html</p>
<p>Anyway, it seems like the Sultan had some business in Slovenia. From what I understand, a Slovenian national named Goce Gligorov sued the Sultan in 2006 for not paying him for "certain investigative and 
other services".</p>
<p>This is further explained in a linked cable: https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06BANDARSERIBEGAWAN422_a.html :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(...)WHO CLAIMS HE HELPED COVER UP THE 
CROWN PRINCE'S AFFAIR WITH A SLOVENIAN WOMAN. (...)</p>
<p>COMMENT:  A LATER GOOGLE SEARCH TURNED UP A 
JUNE 18 ARTICLE IN THE OBSERVER NEWSPAPER STATING THAT 
GLIGOROV CLAIMS TO HAVE FACILITATED A PAYMENT OF "HUSH MONEY" 
TO A SLOVENIAN WOMAN WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE HAD SEXUAL RELATIONS 
WITH THE CROWN PRINCE (...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This lawsuit was again dismissed due to diplomatic immunity.</p>
<p>Pizzagate doesn't seem to have ties to Slovenia (except E. Allan Wendt, the US ambassador to Slovenia, rented some property to James Alefantis) - but Slovenia has some interesting history on, well, "pizza". See "The Slovene Path":

<p><p>Thanks for the feedback. From what I understand, it's either-or if it gets downvoted heavily (or the headline promises more than the content provides).</p></p>
