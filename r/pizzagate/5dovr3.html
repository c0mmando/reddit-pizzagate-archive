    This is hard to argue.. She does look strikingly like the girl.

     she really does, i wouldn't know how to go about finding out if they have a family member who looks like this, searching google came up with nothing for me.

     Except that it's Podesta's granddaughter.  Unless she was adopted, this is nothing.

      oh ok i couldn't find that she was a granddaughter, i searched family members and nothing came up. It was a simple search that's why i asked here. Strange how similar she looks though.

    see older thread here:

    If one can proof that the oldest granddaughter of Podesta was adopted, I am more inclined to look at this more seriously.

    Why is that girl's hands cable tied. What's the context for this photo? Who is she? She's clearly in distress. I really don't think she's Maddie. It's a very creepy scene. Surely someone knows who she is?

     They aren't.  She's holding a card.

    I know this is a shotty link, but the Wine and bar addition to Politics and Prose Is called the "Den", which happens to be the same name as the organization that was exposed having the pedophile  "pool parties" led by Marc Collins-Rector
   </p>
   <p>
    Also, the font for Politics and Prose is very similar to the font from "American Horror Story"
