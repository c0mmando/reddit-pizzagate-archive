        <strong>We need to understand our suspects-- learn about their histories. VICTIMS OFTEN BECOME ABUSERS</strong>
        <p><p>Here's my thought:</p>
<p>Many pedophiles were victims of abuse themselves.</p>
<p>If we can find CREDIBLE evidence linking our suspects to past child abuse, we begin to establish an M.O.
These are still just people, and you can understand people if you look at them closely.
We need to understand how they've gotten to this point, and why they'd be involved in such weird activities.</p>
<p>Start looking for clues in the emails, biographies on these people, articles detailing their earlier lives, whatever you can find. I'll be getting on it myself.</p>
<p>Whether or not there's a pedo-ring happening, this is still very weird and disturbing considering how far into the government it goes. I'm still coming at this with hesitance, because if we're wrong, we're doing serious damage to people's lives.</p>
<p>Let's get some facts and not just throw darts at the board with our eyes closed.</p></p>
