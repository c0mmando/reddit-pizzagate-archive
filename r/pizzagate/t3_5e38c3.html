        <p><p>It appears Good Humor is owned by Unilever. I found a page on Unilever's <a href="https://www.unileverusa.com/news/news-and-features/2015/there-is-no-business-case-for-enduring-poverty.html">website</a> that features the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. I found ties with UNICEF and Sustainable Development Goals to end <a href="https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/sustainable-development-goals-aim-end-human-trafficking/29864">Child trafficking.</a></p></p>

        <p><p>This is the perfect cover. If you have learned anything this month, I hope it is that people love to champion a cause as a cover for doing the opposite.</p></p>

        <p><p>Not only is it two concentric hearts, it's actually a heart spiral, if you look closely, which is exactly what the CP logo is. They seem to like turning things into spirals. Triangle spiral, heart spiral. </p>
<p>If a company has a double heart logo, it could maybe be coincidence. But a double heart logo that's also a spiral? :/</p></p>

        <p><p>That's algida. Known under different names in different European countries, this is one of the big ice cream companies. I believe it belongs to Unilever or Nestl√© or similar. </p>
<p>Frankly I'd call a deaf end on this. Too big to be a cover.</p></p>

        <p><p>Could be a lead or not, but I would advise broadening your view on all of this.  It definitely wouldn't be too big to cover.  These pedo rings go back a long long long time.  This isn't new.  No doubt in my mind it is entirely possible corporations were formed for and by pedos.  I mean, look at our government, it is organized crime, and most are just starting to figure it out.  They've covered it for at least 60+ years. Most likely it's been going on much longer than that</p></p>

        <p><p>I definitely wasn't suggesting it was a cover merely because of the logo. I just find it...unsettling and worth making a note of.</p></p>

        <p><p>I understand!  I was looking into pizzerias in Zandvoort, Netherlands, and in one picture there was a trashcan with the two hearts.  I thought I had found a connection, but someone linked it to garbage businesses and ice cream- Good Humor- in Europe.  I was a little bummed.  Even though it's all been dismissed, there could be undercurrents from the company's inception, or when it began incorporating other businesses.  Not necessarily from now.  It's something to think about when researching companies that are about 100 years old.  </p></p>

        <p><p>We have to be careful. The besta pizza being owned by a doj employee involved in child traffiking is odd because he should be well aware of the symbolism...</p>
<p>That said we have to realize that triangles and hearts are very common shapes used in logo design... not all instances should be automatically assumed to be secret pedo code unless there is additional reasoning (like in the case of besta pizza). </p>
<p>Also, I dont think the majority of pedo rings want to be that out in the open.</p></p>

        <p><p>Like I said in another comment, it is not merely two hearts but it is a heart spiral, which is the exact pedo shape. Take a closer look, that's not an accident. </p>
<p>But I am not accusing GH of anything at all, I'm merely pointing out that their logo is the exact pedo logo. If they are not aware of this, I would change their logo if I were them. </p></p>

        <p><p>I can see it now... All their ice cream will be pulled from the shelves for [listeria, salmonella, etc.] and it will show back up in stores with a different logo.</p></p>

        <p><p>Look at the pedo logo again before you dismiss it. It's not merely two hearts, it's a heart spiral, that's a very specific shape. This is noteworthy, please look at the evidence before you dismiss it.</p></p>
