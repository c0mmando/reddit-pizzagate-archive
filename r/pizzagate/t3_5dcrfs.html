        <strong>I come from /all lurking. Please don't let this be another Boston bomber.</strong>
        <p><p>I'm not gonna say I've followed this form the beginning, but I've seen a decent portion of it. Remember that girl in the US that was missing in like Florida or something the other day? Remember that a redditor found some weird youtube video that everyone thought depicted a victim being tortured and kept in a small room, seemingly by some creepy dude? Yeah, he was an actor and the lady in the video was an actress. Remember the girl people thought was the victim in the short video? Remember her family, who's trauma has obviously since resurfaced?</p>
<p>By all means, pursue this scandal. I'm sure no one would disagree  at this point that people that come up with crazy conspiracy theories are often inspired by ridiculousness and typically poisoned with some cynical outlook or deranged perspective. With that being said though, there's been a lot of really outrageous conspiracies that have surfaced lately which have, oddly enough, turned out to be in some way fruitful. I'm sure we owe it to potential victims to investigate this, as the risks are unfortunately pretty serious if they're accurate.</p>
<p>Just please, don't take it too far. People don't deserve to have such traumatic experiences resurfaced. Try not to forget that.</p>
<p>So there's not any more confusion: I'm not against this and I think it's a good idea. The second paragraph pretty plainly says I think we owe it to people potentially involved to investigate this. Read a little slower, guys.</p></p>

        <p><p>Wait did you think I was saying this suspicion was born of ridiculousness? That's not accurate. I was saying that often conspiracies are, and that I don't think anyone would deny that.</p></p>

        <p><p>Also don't forget, that the information was useful to the police because it did allow them to quickly identify the people in the situation. Unlike this current situation in which we haven't seen any movement of authority attempt to check the validity of these claims.</p>
<p>So even though you might want to compare the situations and warn us of how it might affect others, you need to also keep in mind that even if it did reopen wounds, I still bet people were grateful that there were those who actually cared enough to warn them of a video that could lead to her being found, and give them closure.</p>
<p>In this case it didn't but we should be living in a society where we are willing to take the first step forward and do our best to seek justice than to worry about being wrong and causing old wounds to reopen when people are attempting to seek justice for them.</p></p>

        <p><p>After doing some reading, the revelations are just another "crazy conspiracy" in your eyes? That the stakes of what has potentially been discovered here warrant dismissal like alien abductions or whatever...</p>

        <p><p>So you are trying to stifle investigation by claiming to be so, soooooo very worried about the traumatized victims. Oh my, HOW VERY NOBLE OF YOU to be so super duper extraordinary CONCERNED!</p>

        <p><p>Damn man... I'm suggesting people take it easy. It's so simple to insist something is a fact when it just sits in an echo chamber.</p>
<p>But for real, read that again...</p>

<p>This doesn't mean that I think what people apart of #pizzagate are saying is crazy, in fact I've seen mentions of pizza being used to denote child porn and the likes before. I think it's reasonable. </p>
<p>I was saying that people often come up with crazy ideas that others can get behind because they're so outrageous, and that I don't think people would disagree. It pretty plainly <em>didn't</em> say that this is one of those things. In fact, I said right after that sentence that I think we do in fact have a responsibility to help out people that could potentially be involved.</p>
<p>I was thinking before that you guys suck at reading, but now it looks like too many of you are sensitive to people disagreeing, or I'm shit at conveying meaning. I can easily accept either.</p></p>

        <p><p>Do you specifically mean past victims? The problem is that in this case we don't believe that the past victims have even ever been rescued (Unless you consider Kathy O'Brien and other alleged victims, and it would appear that they all WANT the current victims to be rescued).</p>
<p>You need to clarify what "don't take it too far" means. We get enough spam and trolling, if that's all you have to say, and it's really nebulous, then can we just lock your post?</p></p>

        <p><p>Firstly, don't put yourselves in a bad position for pursing this. If you aren't around to investigate it, or are in jail and incapable, that's one less person we have on the right side.</p>
<p>Other than that, don't go reaching and lump things in that are off the mark. Like I mentioned in the OP, if it is some tangential event, be careful about linking it to pizzagate. It would suck to have an erroneous accusation made in light of the circumstances here.</p></p>
