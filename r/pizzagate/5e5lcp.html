   <strong>
    How pedophilia happens. How pedophiles distort sexuality. What can be done?
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm attempting to understand what is happening to make an Adult into a predator.
   </p>
   <p>
    I understand a lot of the abuse is generational and so it happens to a kid and they grow up to do it to another kid and so on.
   </p>
   <p>
    But besides that aspect. Just in its general occurrence. Not necessarily dealing with the ritual satanic stuff. That needs it's own forum,tbh.
   </p>
   <p>
    I want to share my experience, not with being abused but to say when I was a child I had sexual impulses. Fortunately, I wasn't preyed on but expressed it with the kids my age that lived on my street. My friends.
   </p>
   <p>
    So I know there is a period of early development when we are sexually curious. Wilhelm Reich has done many studies on sexual energy, he called it orgone. But it recognizes and expands upon the sexual energy in early development and beyond. I wrote papers on it in college.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unfortunately this natural curiosity is preyed upon. The predator only has to supply cues to the child.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you watch this 60 minutes Australia vid you see him all but saying he is giving a cue to the child's sexual impulses because he knows it will lead to him having sex with the child.
   </p>
   <p>
    https://youtu.be/jHMr_x0ecbs
   </p>
   <p>
    Basically what he believes is the child wants it without any discrimination.
As the reporter points out this is the same justification all pedophiles use.
   </p>
   <p>
    But what the pedo says is a distortion. The child has no control of the ramifications of the impulses they are having and how they fit in the adult society later in life. They don't know they are being preyed upon.
   </p>
   <p>
    When you try to tell a pedo this they deny it. They actually say it's societies fault for saying it's a abuse and that it's wrong. So it's our fault the child is being abused. Fucked up, right?  It's called cognitive bias.
   </p>
   <p>
    So how do you even change this in a person? It deals with their own beliefs and their own justifications. They deny it's wrong.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is such a problem, but we need answers more than ever.

     True that! Whatever they did to become fucked up in the head, not my problem. Not the innocent children's problem. They are going down!

        Killing somebody is not a solution. When has it ever been? 
Think rationally, I know this subject is very traumatic and people want to be rid of it,  But that's not the way. That just makes us predators and murderers while pedos still pedo.
       </p>
       <p>
        So Sorry man, a few bullets against an army of hidden predators won't do shit. And all you people saying for people to kill themselves, you are acting like fucking imbeciles.

         Sorry, but humanity had a simple solution for these kind of problems that worked very well to deter others.
Only in the last what, 60 years have we not executed CM's? Look where it's got us. 100's of thousands of people fueling an industry which literally has destroyed and murdered millions of little children.
        </p>
        <p>
         Maybe we need to do some soul searching about the need and benefits of capital punishment in western society.

          Has killing murderers stopped people from getting murdered?
         </p>
         <p>
          Capital punishment doesn't work. It just gets rid of one person, not the reasons that person is what they are.
         </p>
         <p>
          -so we need to address to the reasons our society is like this. These are big problems.

         Fuck you OP. Come back once someone you love get's molested and then we'll see how you feel about what kind of response pedophiles deserve. If you aren't with us, you're against us IMO.

           I'm sorry for letting my emotions get the better of me there. Think about this:
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            More than 47% of admitted child molesters have been sexually abused as children.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            Of those molested more than 50 times, 82% can be categorized as pedophiles
           </em>

            Dude I totally understand, I'm not normally emotional but this investigation is very stressful and emotionally it's like going through the ringer. So I don't mean to project my anger at the group.

             Don't get me wrong, I do understand where you are coming from and I think that people should seek serious psychiatric help at the first sign about having sexual thoughts about a child. But then again, I think that is an incredibly dangerous situation to rely on the
             <em>
              honor system
             </em>
             for.

     Ok delete it. Ignore it. The vid was posted on this site. It's relevant to critique it. I appreciate your automatic denial of it. Just like the rest of the unaware society this site is attempting to wake up.

    most of these people don't even get off to it. this is a pay for play. as in, if you want this position, you are going to do what they want, and let them record it, so they can blackmail you forever. Perfect example is former PM of Britain Edward Heath who is long dead but NOW being connected to Pizzagate, he led Britain into the EU; was it out of blackmail that he did so?

     I have heard Obama described as a pedophile entrapment expert. Haven't looked at him the same since.

    Whilst I in no way condone pedophilia, I think it is important to make a distinction between child abusers and pedophiles.
   </p>
   <p>
    It surely takes great courage to admit to yourself that you are sexually attracted to minors but have the morality and will-power to not act on those desires?
   </p>
   <p>
    Surely we can treat people for this mental illness? Who knows what childhood traumas they have experienced? Open your mind to the possibilites which lead to such deviant behaviour. People are a product of their environment, their culture, their society, their education and their role models. Think about the deeper causes of pedophilia to truly combat this perversion.

     The only difference would be the levels. I'm in no way downplaying this, any predatory action towards a child will traumatize them. Everyone here was a child and knows how fragile that experience is.
    </p>
    <p>
     But there is a difference in the levels at which it's taken if they are allowed to continue without any one to stop them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not only does that shatter the childs belief systems about relationships and most other systems, but it completely engulfs the child in terror so they leave. It turns them into a shell, a fragmented self.
    </p>
    <p>
     So there are degrees in which the child is affected. And there are organized levels to which these people take there acts. I Wouldn't be surprised if it's layered like a secret society where each level was a more despicable thing. That's why this ,imo needs it's own forum. The ritual aspect is a whole other world of sick.

    I'm a pedophile I love children whether you believe that or not I don't want to hurt them and these pizzagate theorys are worrying to me and I just want the children to be safe and hope these people are caught. Because the evidence is looking more and more worrying
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit: I should have known I will be downvoted for being a pedophile

     You are afraid? I know why, it's easy. This is being exposed more than ever and what could happen is the behavior is going to punished as a mental disease, eventually. And your mind is going to have to be reprogrammed. Don't know what to tell you. I don't want to kill you. That's not right.

      I wanted to add, that sadly, all of the mk ultra, and abuse of children has showed us something. That you can get a person to dissociate from certain core ideas about themselves, and re-introduce a new suggestion.
     </p>
     <p>
      So in a way, pedophilia has showed us it's own cure.

     I understand that some people have a proclivity towards sexual interest in children. If you are one of the few that can restrain yourself and only indulge in cartoons/hentai, I commend you for not contributing to actual children being actually harmed. However, I would recommend keeping it to yourself - you won't find any sympathy on a mostly right-wing subreddit that is actively on a pedophile-hunt.

      See, that's the funny thing about pedos that has had me stumped for years. How do we know only a few can't restrain themselves? From our perspective the vast majority of pedos we know about, we only know about because they got caught doing
      <em>
       something
      </em>
      . I don't think
      <em>
       lust pedos
      </em>
      (note: not
      <em>
       power pedos
      </em>
      ) are much different from anyone else, just cursed with an unfortunate attraction. I'm a straight male and I'm not going to rape a woman just because I'm attracted to women, I like many others have self-control and a conscience, and so do a lot of pedos.
     </p>
     <p>
      But than again trying to figure that out gets complicated with all the factions of pedos there are. There's the hurtcore crowd (sadistic/power pedos like Podesta &amp; co. might be), the non-nude/modeling enthusiasts that often hate actual CP (they frequent chans and obsessively collect sets, the dark web too but not as much), the ones that like softcore CP (they visit the dark web mostly, but also some chans), the ones that like hardcore CP (definitely dark web guys), the non-offenders that hate child molesters and
      <strong>
       ALL
      </strong>
      CP (I think their biggest home is Girl Chat if it's still around), and then there's the crowd that focuses primarily on molestation--either for profit or satisfaction--and they consist of producers, groomers, handlers, kidnappers, traffickers, ring members, lone wolf molesters that act alone, etc.
     </p>
     <p>
      There's a
      <strong>
       lot
      </strong>
      of types of pedos out there too that I didn't even mention to try and keep things somewhat simple. There's overlap between the groups but it's impossible to know how many of each group there is, and how many of which groups are overlapping with which others. A lot of them actively despise other groups as much as normal people despise pedos in general. I've seen NN lovers that hate pedos into CP--both hard and softcore--because it can either harm children or put them in harms way because it creates a market demand for CP, nn/sc/hc  guys pretty much all hate the
      <em>
       living fuck
      </em>
      out of hurtcore pedos because of how sadistic and cruel they are to children, and the girl chat non-offenders absolutely hate
      <em>
       everyone
      </em>
      else for a huge laundry list of reasons.
     </p>
     <p>
      Shit is fascinating! While I don't approve of the FBI running CP sites on TOR, I do hope they're keeping detailed records about what accounts are downloading and viewing what so they can be analyzed, and possibly even lead to pedos being grouped into strictly defined categories based on their statistical threat levels to help LEAs better recognize and focus their efforts on the serious threats (a lot of time really is wasted at the bottom of the barrel phishing for easy busts). I'd kill to go through that data to and try and map it, but it would still be lacking one key piece of info - the non-offenders. I could write 20 more posts this size going into full detail about "pedo culture", their internal politics, their beliefs, the other types of pedos there are and how, where, and why they overlap. Even with all that I still don't have a fucking clue how large of a demographic the non-offenders are when compared to the rest.

       That is pretty interesting. As an average joe, I don't think of pedos in factions really - there's the ones that actually abduct kids or make the cp, the ones that view the cp, and the ones that don't - and that much categorization only happened because I caught a few minutes of an interview with a non-violent pedo on some documentary or something.

        That's actually what got me curious in the first place. I saw an interview with a non-offending pedo and I had to take a step back and really reflect on what I was hearing. Up to that point I had hated pedos--and for good reason--but I also realized that I hated them viciously yet I really didn't know shit about them besides the obvious. Once I started talking to pedos (a
        <em>
         lot
        </em>
        of pedos) and listening to what they had to say on places like IRC, 12chan, newsgroups, and a few other places I noticed something I didn't expect, there's a huge chunk of pedos out there that hate themselves
        <em>
         because
        </em>
        they're pedos (seems like a phase until they learn acceptance). A lot of times they're seeking validation that they're not monsters from other like-minded pedos because they have this secret desire that they can never act on, so they're stuck feeling consistent guilt and shame, always fearing someone will find out, and they have little-to-no support to get help except from other like-minded pedos who know what they're going through. It's not like they can seek help and stay safe while keeping their career, family, and social lives fully intact once that cat's out of the bag! It was a really weird rabbit hole at times like that. I swear I could write a book on pedophilia.

         I guess it still kind of creeps me out to think about treating it the same way as homosexuality or being trans
         <em>
          . I can't imagine being attracted to kids, while I can sympathize with loving a consenting adult of the same sex, and at least empathize with feeling as though one was born in the wrong body. I'm not sure what side of the fence I'm on. Maybe pedos
         </em>
         should* hate themselves, even non-violent ones who don't partake of CP. Maybe that's the appropriate response to those kinds of feelings.
        </p>
        <p>
         That said, I'm not agreeing that they should kill themselves. The same way that one might use self-hate to fuel going to the gym or dieting because they don't like being fat, maybe just do the same thing and learn to be an adjusted person. I'm not sure if that works. It's just all too weird.

       Thanks for the post,my bf had a traumatic experience in his early childhood,which resulted in him abusing someone when he got little older,&amp; some more other not so good to share experiences.I am facing lots of issues in our relationship because of his past traumas, as his behavior is still sometimes guided by those,n when questioned he never have any reply for the "why" of any wrong action he did/thought about.He does something &amp; he says he doesn't know why he did this &amp; blames everything on his childhood experience.It feels like hell.

      You may be right, but lets not think all pedophiles want to hurt children.
     </p>
     <p>
      They(the pizzagate people) seem like child molesters and sadists to me who get off on hurting children

       70% of the subreddit (who are real and not shills) are just concerned people who have no technological prowess but want to be of help catching criminals. The remaining 30% actually have the knowledge to actively pursue, in some fashion, finding those who hurt children and spread corruption. But in that 30%, I can believe that some may be finding the information without the intention of exposing politicians or doing anything useful towards the purpose of justice. But mostly, everyone here who is a real person hates pedophiles.

        Hates pedophiles or hates pedo criminals? Woud make more sense to hate the abusers rather than one attracted to children.

         I can't really say one way or the other. Many people think even having sexual thoughts about children should be a punishable offense.

         I hate adults who are sexually attracted to children. If this is part of your mindset, then you deserve to be exterminated from our species.

       Okay, I think people that have a scat fetish are gross and it would make me not want to associate with them. You wanna bang kids, so yeah, you're disgusting. You can have those thoughts, you do not have the right for those thoughts to be accepted by others.

       Scuse me here. Are we seeing "normalisation" shills on this subreddit? The last damn thing i want to see discussed here is how some pedophiles are no trouble. "They" have normalised a lot of things in society, i'll be fucking damned if this is going to be one of them. I would not at all mind seeing an insta-ban on any self-proclaimed pedophiles or pedophile advocates.

       You think someone just wakes up one day and molest's a child without having a previous history of suppressed attraction to children?
