        <p><p>It's real.  There is no 'if.'  Too much evidence.  As for why reddit admins aren't censoring it, I don't think they necessarily have a motive to do so.  For one thing, they probably aren't even reading the posts, so it probably just looks like noise to them.  And if some of them are actually reading and finding them credible, I would hope they aren't so corrupt as to censor something so unambiguously evil, even if they are/were all Hillary supporters.</p></p>

        <p><p>Posts with sensitive stuff disappear all the time. </p>
<p>Has anyone checked pizza-related emails for release dates? If none of them are in releases from before Oct. 15 (the last day I'm more or less sure wikileaks was uncompromised) that would be fishy. </p>
<p>If they managed to send people on a wild goose chase by planting evidence and anon posts, it would be a 2-in-1 for them by a) diverting a huge portion of research attention away from the emails themselves and onto this track and by b) destroying the credibility of all Clinton-related research in the minds of the general public when they tie it to this.</p>
<p>Maybe I just don't want to believe it...</p>

        <p><p>That depends on perspective.  What is the most "reasonable" and "simple" explanation depends entirely on one's worldview, such as how naive vs. how "cynical" one is, and on one's internal sense of probability concerning "coincidences." To me, there is so much evidence of this pedo ring (confirming what FBIanon told us!) that the simplest explanation by far is that it's real. </p></p>

        <p><p>That wouldn't make any sense at all.  (a) We only caught onto this largely by luck and some very smart people on here.  (b) The evidence was all mostly in the public domain already (the code talk in the emails just clued some people in to where to start looking; i.e. Comet Pizza). (c) If they wanted to distract us from the emails, this certainly would accomplish the opposite; it has people digging like crazy, and there are enough people digging that this isn't likely to throw us off from finding non-pizza-related stuff.  </p>

<p>I can sure see how one might want to look away from this. People keep asking "how deep does the rabbit hole go?" Shit getting real for real. </p></p>

        <p><p>Because these people have been hiding in plain sight the whole time.  If they react they will be uncovered, they are hiding from themselves!  The spam code from podesta's email mimics the spam found in shitty online game chat rooms from the mid 00's.  They would just spam their dirty murder pedo cult codes out into the ether and then people who knew what was up would the code and then act on it.  Wikileaks was genius in that if they start covering their tracks now it'll be insanely obvious that there's a coverup going on.  Frog in a boiling pot of water indeed.</p></p>
