    Don't click on any of the evidence they tell you is real. They are honeypots.

    Well to be fair, what counter-evidence do you have to back up this claim?

     Exactly. I think it's clear who the real shill is in this instance. This community is starting to make some serious progress, and these sorts of attacks will only increase. Here are a few of the tactics they will use:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      They will develop and exploit disagreements within the community to divide us
     </li>
     <li>
      They will sow a lot of doubt by planting disinformation and making us question what is real and what isn't
     </li>
     <li>
      They will use scare tactics to discourage us from digging deeper
     </li>
     <li>
      They will plant/exploit flimsy evidence that the media can use to discredit the investigation
     </li>
     <li>
      They will vote-brigade to manipulate opinion and what is visible on the front page.
     </li>
    </ol>

    No harm done either way really - it takes two seconds to comment on a thread, and if nothing comes from it then it is literally no big deal whatsoever.  People are digging independently one way or another.  One bullshit claim isnt going to change anything.  This movement stops for no one

    'honeypots' is an extremely overused term meant to scare us from continuing to do our work, they can get our IP address' a number of ways. Not denying this pizza site hack is off but simply wanted to call you out on that lol
   </p>
   <p>
    edit: obviously downloading CP is a honeypot where they can literally raid your home then, but the IP address argument is shill based

    Why would a British Intelligence agency want to do that? You are going to have to explain your assertion and back it up with some evidence before I'm going to believe it.

     Mainly because MI6, GCHQ, NSA, CIA, etc are all cut from the same cloth. Our NSA and the British GCHQ openly trade info on each other's citizens and sell that info to ad agencies worldwide. They all work together. The question you ask: "Why would a British Intelligence agency want to do that?"- is the question they want you to ask. They want it to seem like that makes no sense and that's how they win/get you.

      Apparently this particular small chain of pizza joints (2) is in the heart of our domestic terrorism network. So the question is, why would these spy organizations what to expose one of their own?

      If the title is correct, then it would have to be seen as a British attack on the US, sort of like the BP gulf oil spill. Where is the evidence to support it? I sure haven't seen any. That is really sloppy reporting.

     Can't be a honey pot if he was the one claiming to have the info.  Wouldn't it be a honeypot if he was asking people to send illegal stuff to him?  At worst, I think its just a guy making up a story.

      Or an attempt at entrapment, click on the porn and get arrested. Then you are no longer going to be snooping on the internet.

     <p>
      What other reason could there be for a fake story with real porn? What is the possible motive?

       He didn't post any though - he was asking how to best handle the dissemination of what he found to protect himself and to safeguard the community.  If you accidentally come across illegal pornography on the internet, you can report to your local authorities and you should be OK.

        Not true, he posted a link, folks checked it out and verified that it was real child porn and very horrible.
       </p>
       <p>
        Naturally our hosts here removed it, as they should. This is all still very much up in the air as to what it is.

     UPDATE
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     The level of incompetence in this "hack" is extremely concerning. I am not sure what the original OP was trying to accomplish, but without the private key this is useless.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     The original OP should provide all of the data/files/html as evidence to MULTIPLE PDs (local or otherwise including the NYPD) before posting on the internet. You need to protect yourself, and establish a chain of evidence. Contacting an attorney is also very critical. If you do not have an attorney, get one asap.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     If you do provide "evidence" on the web do it in an encrypted dump in bittorrent, all users should be careful and protect themselves, this could be a honeypot
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     No one cry wolf without validating the original OP's "evidence". Bringing false leads to the authorities is a surefire way to lose all credibility for this sub.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     edit: Other users have pointed out, with good reason that local PD alone may be complicit and may not be the course of action. Simply linking on the internet is not how you bust these people though. You need to get as many eyes on the evidence as possible and make sure they understand you want to establish a chain of evidence and that your life is in danger.

    As far as we know you are part of the controlled opposition. Maybe you are, maybe you aren't. But with a subject as taboo as this you may as well be part of the JTRIG operation.

    Next time there is such a hoax/honeypot expect it to be less blatantly weak. Keep in mind people whoever did this went through the trouble of procuring not only CP but
    <strong>
     child snuff pictures
    </strong>
    (torture). This suggests a very determined OP.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     This experience needs to make our investigation stronger, more resilient to disinformation.
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Personally this kind of blatant and professional attempts at disinformation makes me only more angry and determined!
