        <strong>Origin of /r/secretpizzaparty...</strong>
        <p><p>DISCLAIMER: It was brought to my attention that posts/comments saying /r/me_irl, /r/secretpizzaparty, and /r/scp may be involved might just be distractions. Please take everything here with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>So I was doing some digging into the post histories of some of the /r/secretpizzaparty posters.</p>
<p>Noticed that many seem to have another subreddit that the post to in common, /r/just_post.</p>
<p>The origin point of /r/secretpizzaparty seems to be this post here:</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/just_post/comments/1il54d/organizing_secret_pizza_party/?st=ivg13tbq&amp;sh=b06cbbb5</p>
<p>Searching through the submission history of /r/just_post for "pizza", the posts are just...strange. I have no REAL evidence so far that this is linked, but would appreciate if someone could archive everything and hopefully help me dig. I'd recommend looking through the post history of the users as well. Either some of these posters just have a strange obsession with pizza (they are members of /r/secretpizzaparty after all), or something is being spoken in code.</p>
<p>Another interesting note, moderator of /r/just_post is also a moderator of /r/me_irl, /r/pizzaproposals/ and /r/supersecretpizzaparty.</p>
<p>I do NOT intend to send anyone on a wild goose chase here, however any possible connections seem post worthy.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Adding this here! So check out THIS post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/just_post/comments/1ih1ix/dear_rjust_post_what_is_the_best_food_and_why_is/?st=ivg2r8b4&amp;sh=9f212012</p>
<p>First comment, links to 2AMYS Neapolitan Pizza, located in DC, 2.2 miles from the location of Comet Pizza. The link is now dead but you can google search 2AMYS and find it's new sites:</p>
<p>http://2amys.tripod.com/
http://www.2amysdc.com/</p>
<p>Aside from a link to some sort of Italian company that provides support for online pizza delivery (I think? the chrome translation to English isn't great... http://www.verapizzanapoletana.org/vpn/history_pizza.html), I haven't found much else. Doesn't seem to be any symbolism either so I may have been wasting my time here, unless anyone else sees something.</p></p>

        <p><p>Found something interesting. On this post someone says they have run out of means of "acquiring" pizza.
https://www.reddit.com/r/just_post/comments/59s7hg/update_4_i_did_not_have_pizza_yesterday/
Someone else then says they guess it is time for hot dogs. Relevant. Also, they didn't say they ran out of money, just ran out of ways. Who the hell can't actually order a pizza unless there are no pizzas around? And how likely is that.</p></p>

        <p><p>For me that's a good lead, just check this post of one of their moderators asking for donations and the pizza comments bellow... that's too weird to be a coincidence... "people should donate or just post"... also they have a LOT of subreddits that consist of random images that makes no send at all...  </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/just_post/comments/5ce83k/dear_posters_well_get_right_to_it_today_we_ask/</p>
<p>Btw some people seems to have donated some cash to them... except there's no apparent donation page to donate for.  </p>
<p>Very shady stuff.</p></p>

        <p><p>If you look through his post history he actually does have an obsession with dogs though, and posts pictures of his dog. I was wary about submitting this post in the first place because it can make EVERYthing seem suspicious whether or not it actually is :(</p></p>
