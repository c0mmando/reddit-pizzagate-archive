        <strong>Has anyone legit been to Comet Ping Pong?</strong>
        <p><p>Although most of you probably haven't, I'm wondering if people here has really been to the place of crime, Comet Ping Pong and if you have been there, do you have anything relevant to r/pizzagate or in general to say about it?</p></p>

        <p><p>That makes me want to throw up! Even if nothing is going on pedo wise (which all the evidence points that there is something going on) at the very least these are satanist who expose children to seeing things they shouldn't and joke about things that aren't funny!</p></p>

        <p><p>Honestly just look at the Instagram posts, images, and different artists/musicians these people have at their venues. </p>
<p>These people are more than likely disturbed creeps, at the very least. At the worst, it could be much much more than that.</p></p>

        <p><p>Obviously it runs as a normal business outside of its private parties, that is the ultimate cover. </p>
<p>What would be more interesting is to find someone who worked there and is willing to talk openly</p></p>

        <p><p>I guarantee that if weird shit goes down in the shop it's not when any employees are working there.  No worth the shot of some under paid person to open their mouths.</p></p>

        <p><p>No.  Assuming we are heading in the right direction that means this shit is deeper than the Mariana trench.  Everything is going to be compartmentalized. </p>
<p>People are going to know their part of the ring and that's it.  If your the guy/girl finding and gathering kids to transport that's as far as you know.  Maybe your job is find kids deliver them over there.  Well you might be delivering them to a person or more than likely to pretty much a holding cell for the next guy to pick them up.  You have no idea where they are going or why you just know you got paid. </p>
<p>Then you have another one whose job might be to secure buyers.  Well even this person will only no so much of the operation.  In fact for them it might only be they work the customers in a few states and they know the offshore account to wire the money and the random phone number they might call to leave a cryptic message/order.</p>
<p>But one thing I know for sure ANYONE who comes in contact with the real players has videos and pictures of them doing the most fucked up shit imaginable.  Hell it's the only thing that makes me believe in the rituals involving an infant girl and a knife.  If there is tape of you doing the unthinkable you can't say anything.  You know what you did and you know what will happen when the pics or video gets out.  Plus your very well paid and probably a sociopath anyway.</p></p>

        <p><p>I went CUA in DC and ate there a few times. Never even thought it was the slightest bit suspect. Just thought getting to eat pizza while playing ping pong was cool.</p></p>

        <p><p>I live in D.C. currently, and I visited last week because of the ongoing investigation - I just had to see the place b/c I won't be living in D.C. much longer. Besta Pizza, right next door, still has the pedo-logo above their shop, only the online logo has changed apparently. </p>
<p>As for Comet itself, it's a pretty popular place, but VERY off the beaten path. It's all the way in NW near the Maryland border and Chevy Chase (a historically wealthy neighborhood).</p>
<p>My impressions: 
Food and drink is really fucking good </p>
<p>Lots of people bring their children</p>
<p>The vibe of the place is upper-class chill - walls are concrete with paint peeling (for arty effect?) exposed brick everywhere, which is almost kept up to look like it's falling apart. Huge concrete slabs hang like stalactites from the ceiling. </p>
<p>Some weird posters where a mother Mary figure gazes upon pizza. </p>
<p>Also some dude followed me out - but he coulda just been a lonely old gay man (tons of people like that in D.C.)</p>
<p>The most striking thing actually wasn't inside but outside Comet, around the corner there's a really interesting, possibly occult mural painted by Regina Holliday - anyone know anything about her?</p></p>

        <p><p>I went a couple times when I lived in DC (just moved to Minneapolis this past June). My wife went to college in the city and that was a popular place because of the hipster vibe and the ping pong tables, and you could go to Politics and Prose while you waited for a table.</p>
<p>Seemed like your average trendy pizza place, nothing out of the ordinary. I remember liking that they projected this video on the wall of some big artistic Rube Goldberg machine.</p></p>

        <p><p>I went there today. Kept it chill. Had a beer. No cam or anything. Those people are fucking morons. The wannabes. I digress. 
It was quiet and I feel for the staff to be honest. Anyway, nothing out of the ordinary or of note. I went next door after I cashed out. The cafe. Ordinary as the rest. Even peeked in Besta. How THAT place could be involved...I have no idea. It looked like every pizza joint in Manhattan. I hung out in the lot for awhile as well. Just checked it out quiet. Suburbs to the core. There are some rando businesses in a row of townhomes over by the street. I want to go back and check out those offices and just see what kind of tenants it has. It's so close to CPP. It'll have to wait till next week though. I'll check back in.  </p></p>
