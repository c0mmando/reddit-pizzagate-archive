    Has anyone read this article about Scalia's alleged involvement covering up for the pedophile ring?

    Just discovered this, I'm more of lurker but I thought there might be some clues in here for people:
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.veteranstoday.com/2016/08/24/vt-exclusive-largest-pedophile-ring-in-history-70000-members-heads-of-state-the-rats-scramble/
   </p>
   <p>
    This part stood out to me:
   </p>
   <p>
    "The mechanism Scalia used to provide this protection was the Federalist Society which chooses the judges throughout the US judiciary system so should any unfortunate pedophile find himself in court, the judge was under Scalia’s control, thus making a successful prosecution difficult to achieve.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Federalist Society grooms and recruits candidates to become judges at a young age – college age kids; they specifically seek out suitable candidates who have certain moral ambiguities that can be exploited.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus a stranglehold is placed on the judicial system of the United States by a group which serves the interests of big business – corrupt corporations, big pharma, the oil and coal barons; this is how their interests are, time and again, placed ahead of those of we, the people with the result that our environment and our bodies are polluted by the products of these corporations, be it poisons like aspartame and GMO crops in our food, toxins in our ground water (see Flint, MI) or just plain old exploitation of poor people such as the coal miners of West Virginia and Kentucky."

    I have heard about the Scalia pedophilia claims before. However, the Federalist Society does not select federal judges, and Scalia did not have control over other federal judges nor their cases.  Its not how the Federal Judiciary works  The writer should just stick to the facts (there has been testimony from victims claiming Scalia raped them), as his ignorance about the judicial system hurts his claims.

    Scalia was a hardcore Catholic, so much so he didn't use condoms (I assume since he has a huge family). In fact, he hated Obama and refuse to attend his State of the Unions which may seem irrelevant however Podesta has a tight relation to Obama, so if Scalia was in on all of this, you would think he would at least attend Obama's State of the Union speeches.
