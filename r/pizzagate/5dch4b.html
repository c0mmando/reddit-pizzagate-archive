    I know that police have said they are looking for multiple suspects, this is irrelevant to the question at hand.
   </p>
   <p>
    What we need to find out is whether
    <strong>
     the police believe the two efit sketches now represent two suspects
    </strong>
    . At the time of their drawing, the sketches were believed to represent the same person.

     I've mentioned elsewhere that it is possible that they were spotted with a different girl that fit Madeleines description.   This would explain why a kidnapper (or maybe they were just there hanging out $$$ with someone's child) would be out in public with the girl and could be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
     I don't see how those two sketches could be of the same person unless one of the witnesses was blind. It's like laurel and hardy.

      It's likely due to the fact that the Smith's each recounted their own version of the man they saw.

       Descriptions of the suspect were given to the Portuguese inquiry by two witnesses after Madeleine disappeared.

    You are right, but regardless they are brothers and look alike.

     Yeah totally, there's also the possibility that the Smith's saw the two brothers and confused them for the same person. However I think it's important that we only report on what we know to be the case until shown otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though I personally think it's unlikely the Podesta's were physically involved with the kidnapping.
