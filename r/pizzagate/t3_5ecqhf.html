        <strong>After looking through some posts today, many of you need to remember this advice when talking to each other on here:</strong>
        <p><p>If you think the FBI and other agencies aren't keeping an eye on this sub, you are sorely mistaken.  Do not share any pictures.  Do not share any links to pictures showing kids doing shit, naked, etc.  Don't do anything illegal on this one.  They are watching.</p>
<p>The FBI is trying to coverup pizzagate.  I know for a fact that they look at this sub.  They will 100% try to pick people off by setting up traps.  They'll attempt to trick dumb/naive people into thinking they want to help.  They'll word their inquiries in a manner that sounds innocent and soft...then, suddenly you will be getting charged for sharing CP, when you thought you were merely sharing it with someone to get more help in opening up the can of worms that is pizzagate.  </p>
<p>I want to blow this fucked up pedo ring wide open and expose these people, but don't forget that <em>most</em> of us are civilians.  That last bit should set off two bulbs in your heads.</p></p>

        <p><p>Nice information, and attention reminder. Hope people will up this. I am absolutely sure that they are watching. 
I sent fb messages to Jimmy Comet, Biljana and Tony Podesta. Facebook instantly asked me for my ID card with all information, lol. And the thing is it was in like few minutes after i sent msgs. Even tho i used fake fb account many times (for like 5-6 years or so) for personal reasons, facebook never, ever asked me for ID card as proof. They are watching all the time. Nothing new tho. </p></p>

        <p><p>Since posting on this subreddit I have noticed the same van outside my home and work, two days in a row, that I had never seen before. I've taken pictures of the license plates of the van as well as other vehicles that appear to be following me, and I've added those to all the other evidence I've compiled. This stuff is very real and very scary, everyone here must tread carefully. </p></p>

        <p><p>Also keep the content on topic: less religious verses, less MKULTRA and time travel, more research into the things the FBI may not look at as part of a normal investigation. I did Electronic Discovery, and I was limited (as part of the court process) to a subset of the hard drive provided to me. We worked on keyword sets, but we weren't supposed to read emails looking for connections or additional keywords. Finding the relevant terms, deleted emails, maybe avenues to explore. </p></p>
