        <strong>Calling All Parents</strong>
        <p><p>I have been following this revelation for about 3 days, and have had trouble sleeping and even having a normal routine due to being so decimated/horrified/saddened/angry by what has been reported so far. </p>
<p>I am the parent of two young children, both under 4 years of age (a daughter and son). Every single time I look at them and interact with them I think of the unspeakable terror and fear that children worldwide have been exposed to as a result of these subhuman monsters. </p>
<p>Accordingly I want to have some impact, even if minuscule, that may help (even if only infinitesimally) push this towards a critical mass such that these people are held responsible for what they have done. </p>
<p>As much, my plea is this: </p>
<p>Every parent that reads these words, look at your child or children and imagine how'd you'd feel if these unspeakable acts were committed against them. Use the resultant feelings to propel this story as far and as wide as you can, to the ends of the earth, using any and all means possible. </p>
<p>As I lay here and wait for my children to go to sleep tonight, I pray that every parent coming across this post will hear my cry and be moved to action. </p>
<p>Sincerely,
A Fellow Parent</p></p>

        <p><p>It is so difficult to see such atrocities and feel helpless. However, my thought was that maybe, as a parent appealing to other parents, I might have some kind of impact. </p>
<p>I also tried to imagine how I would feel if I was a young child and this was happening to me. I imagined crying out and not having anyone come to my rescue. </p>
<p>It is simply unbearable to contemplate. When I talk with my children today and saw the innocence in their eyes and the way they approach life I just wanted to DIE thinking that other little ones have nobody to protect them. üòû</p></p>

        <p><p>I had a childhood of abuse so i know how helplessness feels. This is everyone's chance to be a voice for the voiceless and even if our individual contributions are small,they add up. Even just seeing people care makes me have a bit more hope in humanity.</p></p>

        <p><p>My oldest daughter 2 of 5 was tasked with finding a play act to do to try out for the next years drama at school. She didn't tell me what it was so when we went I started filming excited and proud of my baby girl. She decided to do a single act of kidnapping through the eyes of the child. From being invited to pet a dog to the kidnapping, holding, abuse and subsequent murder. I was shocked and I just sobbed and sobbed. Everybody turned and stared at me. Ppl don't allow themselves to put themselves in the child's mind because it's so painful. She was praised and I was very proud of her. My birthday is 7-27. The day Adam Walsh was kidnapped.  I remember my mom telling me when I wandered off at the mall when I was 6 or so. Anyway sorry to blather but to see your child acting out her own kidnapping, torture and murder was devastating. I'll never forget it. I pray for all the children and family's. Most evil crime one can commit.  I hope these sickos get what they deserve. </p></p>

        <p><p>Emotional appeals should be frowned upon under these circumstances. It's way too easy to manipulate people with shit like this. I understand people will find this insensitive, but if you have even the slightest understanding of persuasion, you know this shit is super basic given the situation we're in.</p>
<p>Don't get distracted. Complacency isn't an option.</p></p>

        <p><p>I understand and hear you, and I guess what I thought is that I've seen a lot of discussion so far about facts and pictures and locations and actions, but haven't seen much from parents regarding how this directly impacts them (or motivates them). </p>
<p>My deepest desire is to have some impact, no matter how small. </p></p>
