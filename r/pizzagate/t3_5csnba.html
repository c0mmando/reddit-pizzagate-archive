        <strong>Missing 411 and Pizzagate...</strong>
        <p><p>So I've been reading about Pizzagate and the weird spirit cooking stuff for days now. And I can't help but think maybe its possible some of these pedo elites are behind some of the very creepy Missing 411 disappearances of kids (or even adults). </p></p>
