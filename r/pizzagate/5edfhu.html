    How do we get solid evidence on Alefantis?
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Right now, we have a lot of things that, especially together, say "Wow, that's really creepy. He's probably up to some really shady shit."
   </p>
   <p>
    That's not enough. It's enough to catch the public attention for a short time, but it's not proof of anything. If we want him held accountable, we need something undeniable. And I don't think we can rely on the cops or FBI for that. Regardless of whether they're complicit, government is slow and inefficient. Alefantis knows he's under suspicion, and he's sure to be covering his tracks.
   </p>
   <p>
    IMO, all the other leads and branches of this aren't time-sensitive, but catching Alefantis is.
   </p>
   <p>
    I didn't know what evidence would be required or how to get it, but I think figuring that out should be where the attention is focused.
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit to clarify:  Law enforcement needs to handle any actions. We need to give them a really good reason to give it full attention right now.

    Well storming his pizzeria and looking for the underground chambers would, if found, seal the deal.

    Accrue enough evidence to submit to law enforcement for a formal investigation.  As much as we might all like vigilante justice, and feel like law enforcement may be, at some levels, colluding, we need to abide by the laws of this country.

     Yes, perhaps I should've clarified. Law enforcement needs to handle any actions. We need to give them a really good reason to give it full attention right now.

    I'm not holding my breath for the authorities to deal with him. We'll deal with him if they won't though.

    send him a child as a bait and observe his behaviour secretly. I am sure we can catch him.
