    Hansen Vs. Predator Episode Features PIZZA During Interview
   </strong>
   <p>

    Subtle nod?   Rubbing it in our faces?  Or just a jest towards the entire movement?  I understand the general nature of the mainstream media is typically that of dis/misinformation.  But this is a little too close to home, just shy of two weeks after the entire story broke.
   </p>
   <p>
    I am not 100% sure on the air date of this particular episode, but I do find the timing of the YouTube post and the breaking of the obvious pedophile/child trafficking ring in DC to be quite coincidental.  And as many wise men have said, there are no such things as coincidences.

    I watched it and then decided to watch  another episode, it was about a tutor (for kids with wealthy parents) who got busted visiting a kid. Can someone please explain what is really said at 0:49?
   </p>
   <p>
    The guy is obsessed with ... ?
   </p>
   <p>
    I could not hear it well and there was no reference to it in the rest of the video and I can't believe it that it sounds like he's obsessed with pizza. Please tell me if it's something different.

     Well, I hear "he's obsessed with pizza". Whatever that means, children or actual pizza...

      With the sudden downtake of first video in mind, and that the other poster said that it looked staged and that there was no further reference to pizza in the second video, it is kind of weird. Why would he say that in the intro? If this all wasn't crazy like hell I would say that Hansen is hinting since some time that he knows more?

    I was cracking up thinking the same thing. Especially how he just keeps eating pizza like it's no problem. Honestly seemed staged compared to most episodes. I've never seen them let the guy that close to the decoy.

    Also the Lay's Potato Head/Potato Chip/Cannibal commercial I saw today....

     Wow, this is certainly not fun. Please see the trailer video I put down below and watch closely from the 10th second. It made my stomach turn how this got edited. It seems so obvious!!
