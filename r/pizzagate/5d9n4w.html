    Can we stop with the "James Alefantis = J'aime les enfants in french"
   </strong>

   <p>
    I've read it several times here this week, and it looks like some people thinks it's a good evidence.
   </p>
   <p>
    Other french people, am I the only one who thinks this is complete bullshit? I mean, to pronounce James Alefantis "J'aime les enfants" you have to really want it, or be drunk af.
   </p>
   <p>
    And imagine you're a pedophile, do you really want to change your name to something suspiscious? "Hey Irepp Littlekids, can you babysit my daughter tonight?"
   </p>
   <p>
    This kind of bullshit discredits this subreddit, it would be probably better to not spread it without any evidence.
   </p>
   <p>
    PS : Sorry for my english, but you know... I'm french :(

    Nope. The ferocity with which shills are actively burying this tells me that it's a powerful meme to redpill the public. Your refutation is weak sauce -- nearly as weak as the armies skreeching
    <em>
     "It's jusssa tee shirt!!!"
    </em>
    when nobody except them is talking about a damn t-shirt.
   </p>
   <p>
    Since you bring it up, here's a nice info-meme on the topic:

   <p>
    James Alefantis / J'aime les enfants / WTF????

     Alefantis is not an assumed name.  It's his family name, and it's a Greek name, not French.  This kind of stuff is going to make us look like fools, and you look like even more of a fool for calling OP a shill for pointing it out.

      Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) is often generational. It's very possible he was abused by his parents (who named him) from a very young age and set on this path.

         and your hypothesis is what, his greek ancestors adopted a surname that meant something in a foreign language they didnt  understand so that several generations later they could emigrate to america and call a kid "james" in order to better signpost to the world their multi-generational penchant for satanic ritual abuse?

          Nah, that's you. I just like to point out that the name of a suspected pedophile sounds an awful lot like "I love children" in French. I still can't say for sure that it's his given name -- he's a very powerful man, and it'd be pretty easy to fake a lineage.

       I'm trying but I just can't see some evil overlord of a global pedophile  ring changing his name to literally be "I love kids."

           I don't see anything in your pictures that relates to James Alefantis aside from the fact that one other family had the same last name.

            They aren't my pictures. I'm just trying to say that I don't think he ever changed his name, but it is still his name.

     As others have pointed out to you, it's a real family name. I could see a pedophile taking a name like that, like a high school gym teacher using the name "Coach Feratu" if he's a vampire, but there's no evidence that that he ever actually
     <em>
      chose
     </em>
     this name. This doesn't mean anything unless someone can show that he did, either by changing his name, or falsely claiming it as his name.
    </p>
    <p>
     There will be clues that don't mean anything sometimes, and you have to be open to that idea. I think this is one of them.

     THIS is correct.
Forget the shirt.
There is PLENTY of other stuff way more incriminating about this sick fuck and his restaurant.  For example, all the creepy instagram comments, and the fact he BLACKMAILED DAVID BROCK for 850k and a new house.  There's some shit there.

     Are you a mother fucking retard? HIS NAME IS JAMES ALEFANTIS. YOU DON'T NAME YOUR LAST NAME AFTER LOCAL RESTAURANTS. WHAT THE FUCKING HELL ARE YOU SAYING?

     IT ISN'T STRONG EVIDENCE, OR EVIDENCE AT ALL, BUT IT IS ERIE AS FUCK.

     "Let's get some context"...  you're a fucking shill shouting diverting nonsense. You have the top comment yet it has the 3rd # of up votes.

       It isn't about the t-shirt buddy... it's about his name. His name is "James Alefantis".... "J'aime a l'enfant"... 
It never was about the tee shirt.

      Please get the facts right so the shills don't have ammo to argue with us.
It was not him.  It was people he knows though.

       Maybe L'Enfant Cafe should be digged into? It could be an inside joke to have a double meaning, and easy to hide...

        Also, i saw in one of those maps that they've done that connects the evidence a paper where it read "the boom boom room... no cell phone permitted" or something like that on jimmycomet instagram (i think)... people have been trying to tie it to something but it turns out it's actually a place: (http://laboumbrunch.com/laboumboumroom/). Not trying to discourage people, just adding from ALL the info available.

       No but it's a pic of three of his associates, in front of Comet.  Pretty much removes any question in any objective observer's mind that this guy is a complete sicko.

         Definitely no. It's
         <em>
          interesting
         </em>
         absolutely but circumstantial. It is ostensibly a pizza joint for kids to hang out and play ping pong at right? I've seen similar things at other places.

    In all seriousness though, yes, please stop. We need some way to post these little 'random connections' we find to separate it from more substantial stuff.

     Think of how it sounds or rather looks to a native English speaker though. I understand the point about the French pronounciation being very different, but for me that is not the point of the name.

       So you're new to r/pizzagate? Dude. I have no problem with you. I just think it's pretty damn close to the French, at least in spelling.

    It's, at best, barely relevant to the case, I agree.

    I'd say it is most definitely not just a coincidence.  These people are fucking demons, they love to hide in plain sight, adds to the thrill.

   <p>
    And as others have mentioned, how do you explain the shirt?  Come on now...

     Damn I understand why no one take conspirationnists seriously. You guys want to believe so much that you accept everything that goes in the way of your theory, even the dumbest things.
    </p>
    <p>
     I think I wasn't clear enough but, in french "James Alefantis" is really far to sound like "J'aime les enfants". It's closer to "J'aime éléphant".
    </p>
    <p>
     So... I think it's a zoophile ring, I will make a new subreddit based on this discovery.

      It's hard to take you seriously saying words like "conspirationnists" and the inability to see what is right in front of your eyes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Let's just assume for the hell of it that he is in fact using a pseudonym to play on the word grouping "J'aime les enfants".  You think he would make it so damn obvious that it is simply irrefutable that it is linked to "I Love Children"?  James Alefantis is eerily close to the phrase, and that is the only reason we even speak on this topic.
     </p>
     <p>
      And then the image of the shirt, holy shit is it not obvious enough for you yet?

     Thing is, there is so much other stuff to focus on.  THis shirt thing is a fucking distraction and the shills will focus on it because it IS probably a coincidence.  MEanwhile there are mountains of circumstantial evidence that gets ignored while people debate the logo on a FUCKING SHIRT

      I agree, but it can't be ignored either.  It is an extremely minor detail of this entire scandal.

      Wow, totally dusagree! If it's an assumed name, we'd want to know it, so we could discover the pervert's real name. How hard is that to understand? Please stop shilling an entirely legitimate line of inquiry merely because the native French pronunciation doesn't correspond to your idea of how his name is pronounced in English.

       It's not just that though (as far as the T shirt goes).  There is the cafe.  And there is the fact that the entire neighborhood was designed by a guy with the last name Enfant.  That entire area is called Enfant. That explains the shirt.
      </p>
      <p>
       And people did look up the name of Jimmy and Alefantis is his birth name and was his parents name.  So there is nothing there.  Not shilling.  Just trying to get us focused on more of the smoking gun issues.
       <br/>
       Like why he posted all the creepy comments about kids on his insta and then took them down.
Why did he blackmail Brock?
What was in those files on his website that then got taken down?
Stuff like that.

    Its weird but not conclusive... HE DID however post a pic on his public IG of a guy wearing a shirt that had the exact phrase: "J'aime les enfants" (heart logo in place of J'aime) on it standing between 2 shirtless guys.

     A subreddit is the absolute worst way to investigate something like this. Half the posters here are too far behind that they don't know that that has already been debunked. The area was designed by a guy named l'Enfant, a ton of things in the area are named after him, there's a cafe with that exact name, and everyone in the area knows what it means. Probably lots of people have those shirts without being pedophiles, so despite the love these guys have for hiding in plain sight, this is evidence of
     <em>
      nothing at all

    It does seem almost too coincidental that a man who is at the centre of a child abuse scandal should have a name that is an exact (except for the apostrophe) anagram of the French for "I love children"
 JAMES ALEFANTIS
 J'AIME LES ENFANTS - I LOVE CHILDREN
Some posters want to ignore this extraordinary coincidence because they say he had this name from birth - did he?
   </p>
   <p>
    I looked up Greek surnames here
http://surnames.behindthename.com/names/usage/greek
   </p>
   <p>
    I can't find "Alefantis"  but maybe the database is limited to very common Greek names so I went to Google translate
   </p>
   <p>
    Alefantis in Greek is Αλαφάντης according to Google translate.
   </p>
   <p>
    I found people by this name Αλεφάντης which translates as Alifantou the nearest I could get to Alifantis on the internet.
   </p>
   <p>
    So I'm coming to the opinion that Alifantis has a very rare or non existent Greek surname.
   </p>
   <p>
    I wondered what I could find out  about him so I searched the internet.
   </p>
   <p>
    I found this interview about him and his restaurant.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.metroweekly.com/2015/04/from-scratch-james-alefantis/
   </p>
   <p>
    Extracts from interview
   </p>
   <p>
    MW: Did you grow up in D.C.?
   </p>
   <p>
    ALEFANTIS: Yeah. I went to Georgetown Day School, down the street, which I also support a lot. I have their teacher receptions, auction things, I’m on the benefit committee. I won the alumni award — it was for Most Supportive of the School or something — two or three years ago.
   </p>
   <p>
    Is this an award presented to or by Alumni here?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_Day_School
   </p>
   <p>
    Yeah, I loved ping-pong. We played it at my family’s lake cottage in upstate New York, because my parents are from outside of Buffalo.
   </p>
   <p>
    I thought he may be covering his tracks and been to school near Buffalo or been to both schools.  So I did some searching - There appears to be a James Alfentis who graduated from Amhurst Central High School in 1992.
   </p>
   <p>
    http://amherstcentralhighschool.net/alumni-list.html
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amherst_Central_High_School
   </p>
   <p>
    Alfantis is a rare name but there does seem to be a record of a James Alfantis at Anherst Central High School approximately in the area where he says his parents had a holliday cottage.
   </p>
   <p>
    I hope this helps someone with further research - I'm starting to feel that this is some sort of Intelligence psyop

    It would take a lot of moxie to change your name to Irepp Littlekids, but on the other hand, wouldn't anyone accusing you of raping kids look pretty absurd?  It's absurd to think Irepp has some fatalistic destiny to rape kids, y'know?  It's just a name.  Poor Irepp just has an unfortunate name, and anyways, everyone is mispronouncing it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Evil is anti-inductive.  If everyone "knows" that a fact is harmless, it's a real coup if the person that fact is about is concealing something.  Imagine if a philanderer had a reputation as someone with many platonic friends.  This is exactly the kind of reputation a philanderer most prizes.  By their actions, they tend to
    <em>
     degrade
    </em>
    that reputation.  Yet the longer they can keep up the essential tension of maintaining a fact contrary to reality, the longer they can get the personal benefits of philandering without suffering the social costs of being known as a philanderer.
   </p>
   <p>
    Changing one's name to something moxiously close to an actual flaw one has would be the same kind of deed.  It would create a "harmless" reference that would tend to defuse and discredit actual allegations... if it actually happened.  I wouldn't think it a great loss if you persuaded everyone, OP.  Evidence hinging on someone's name is
    <em>
     legitimately
    </em>
    weak.
    <strong>
     Unless the guy can be shown to have a false history, there's no reason for anyone on this forum to harp about his name.

     It isn't evidence. Just pointing out one of the oddest coincidences of all time.

    "James Alefentis" is an anagram of "J'aime les enfants".
It's not an exact match, but close enough.

      Too many people getting distracted from the actual evidence.  There's been an influx of not-so-critical thinkers.

     actually it's called circumstantial evidence.  and when there are mountains of it, you can even convict.
