    What is the source for the decoder terms? (i.e. pizza, pasta, handkerchief, etc.)
   </strong>

   <p>
    Hey guys, curious to hear where this came from. Some of the blog sources are citing a 4chan thread that went down, but do we have any other verifiable sources? Any other pedophilia rings using this terminology?

    I haven't seen a source for the slang either. It was just presented as fact. The
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief_code">
     handkerchief code
    </a>
    is well-established. "Pizza" and "cheese pizza" are also well-established code for child pornography from the chans and elsewhere presumably. "Map" was suggested to be semen, for example, in reference to the realtor finding John Podesta's black and white handkerchief.
    <a href="http://imgur.com/RXZUHDD">
     Here's
    </a>
    a 4chan capture. I've personally never seen it cross-referenced. Hopefully someone else has.

     I don't find any of those theories plausible.   There are such things as handkerchiefs with maps on them.   Just google it.   I'm guessing she was literally referring to a handkerchief with a map focusing on pizza places.   It's what goes on in the pizza places, or what they are fronts for, that matters.
    </p>
    <p>
     I don't think the alleged code language is a very good lead.   Comet Ping Pong on the other hand...

      You're saying they use handkerchiefs as maps rather than paper but coded language is implausible?

    It's been used in certain websites/groups... The .onion type... I have a screen shot of one such from earlier this year...
   </p>
   <p>
    Example someone looking for 13-14 slices of pizza. Etc..

      Yeah, I think that's the way it worked, sadly the very topic prevents most people from actually joining these groups and websites etc to find out more info... I know I wouldn't want to see that stuff or get caught in that mess

    This post needs to be taken much more seriously by this subreddit. Alot of the accusations hinges on the fact that there is a code among pedos that is being used in the podesta emails.
   </p>
   <p>
    We need links to clear cut cases of this code being used in pedo or sex trafficking rings.

    From what I recall of the chans there is a entire group dedicated to trolling the dark web and outing Pedos. Pedo Bear is their mascott and they hate KP (kiddie porn) they've been doing this for years. So what happened is they started reading the emails and sentences that didn't make any sense like "Im gonna get some pizza for an hour" made sense to them as they knew the codes and symbols.

     Close.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those groups arent trolling and outing pedos... they are pedos.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pedobear isnt a mascot of anti-pedo activism... pedobear is the mascot of pedos.
    </p>
    <p>
     They understood the code words because they are their own code words.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was only a handful of lurkers who watched these pedos who helpfully explained what the code words meant to the masses.

      Actually, Pedobear was originally used to signal 4chan mods to delete threads with CP in them. I don't know if it's been compromised over time.
