        <strong>Anyone looked at Waris Ahluwalia?</strong>
        <p><p>What is the connection here?</p>
<p>We remember the Rachel / Billy image. So there is a connection with Rachel and and a guy name Waris - who also is connected with Hillary and Marina Abramovic (the spirit dinner woman). </p>
<p>Marina and Podesta is connected with the creepy spirit cooking mail : </p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15893</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, Marina is seen with this guy several times - Waris Ahluwalia : </p>
<p>Like here : http://www.wmagazine.com/parties/2011/11/sol-lewitt-mondrian-hotel-new-york-ss/photos/slide/6</p>
<p>Or here : http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/10/party-pics-wintour-kloss-love-and-more/slideshow/2013/10/01/party_lines/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Waris is also seen with Rachel here : </p>
<p>https://bfa.com/people/heidi-bivens/photos/691468</p>
<p>And also, though a little blurred, it seems that Waris is on a picture, on Rachels myspace page : https://myspace.com/306140959/photos</p>
<p>He doesn't have the most discreet appearance so it's kinda easy to figure out, that it is him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is he interesting you may ask? Well, for once he was once a secret service agent : http://www.interviewmagazine.com/fashion/house-of-waris-clinton-foundation-pendant</p>
<p>The article also states that he first encountered the Clintons in his college years. Just a little site-track, but notice that pendant they are talking about. With the 'Omnia Vincit Amor' text - this one : http://www.interviewmagazine.com/fashion/house-of-waris-clinton-foundation-pendant</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yea, first thing that pops up on search engines : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_Vincit_Omnia_(Caravaggio)</p>
<p>This 16-century painter apparently had a little thing for painting little boys - though I guess that's not so strange given the time. From the wiki though : </p>
<p>"Caravaggio’s treatment is remarkable for the realism of his Cupid – where other depictions, such as a contemporary Sleeping Cupid by Battistello Caracciolo, show an idealised, almost generic, beautiful boy, Caravaggio’s Cupid is highly individual..."</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>So who is this Waris guy? He seems to be all over the place. Here he is again with Hillary : http://www.sikhcouncilusa.org/article.aspx?article=evtdinner</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have shots and docs, but not to sure how interesting or connected it all is. Shit seems crazy these days. </p>
<p>Made this little infogram for a quick connection : http://imgur.com/JF5EWFu</p></p>

        <p><p>He's an actor too. Maybe a Hollywood connection? http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1753302/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1</p></p>
