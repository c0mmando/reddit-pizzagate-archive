<strong>Is this real?</strong>
<p><p>EDIT: Please read the whole thing. I already know about Pizzagate. This is about something different I'm dealing with. Thanks to everyone who commented or PMd me links to the various catchup posts. </p>
<hr/>
<p>Oh god. What is going on?</p>
<p>I've been using the internet for 14 of the 19 years I've been alive. I basically spend all my day on it. Its how I do everything. Work, studies, interactions, everything. And I've seen some shit. I mean things that even some 4channers might sometimes shy away from.</p>
<p>I've been abused. Harrased. Doxxed (So much so that I started using my IRL name as my username to tell people to fuck off)</p>
<p>Never have I ever been scarred. I've sometimes been a little disgusted and ashamed, sure. But the response with seeing such things was always 'Meh, its the internet. What can you do?'</p>
<p>But this is the first time I genuinely feel terrified. </p>
<p>I'm a liberal (but fuck SJWs). I'm not even a fraction as paranoid as the people in /r/conspiracy. I've always analyzed things. Looked at proof. Researched things. I was always the first to point out that a lot of what my circle shared online was stupid, fake, or overblown. </p>
<p>But this is too big to ignore. This has a lot of things that I cannot possible dismiss as a prank, or a hoax, or a delusion.</p>
<p>Shit. </p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>Am I dreaming?</p>
<p>If so, someone please wake me up. </p>
<p>Please. </p></p>

<p><p>Yeah but I'm not the type of guy to go with my gut. I mean I have hunches, but they're all calculated. I'm a nerd. I research, plan, organize, test, and confirm things. I mean FFS the first time I asked out a girl I made an entire fuckin schedule and plan on how to do it. I was 14. </p>
<p>But this evidence. Its just too much coincidence. And if that level of coincidence existed I would be bumping into Emilia Clarke everyday. It just can't happen. </p></p>

<p><p>I'm not confused. Its just incredible. This whole thing. It sounds a lot like 'lizard people' paranoia, but the more I look, the more stuff there is that is too much to be a coincidence.</p>
<p>Once is chance</p>
<p>Twice is a coincidence</p>
<p>A hundred times is a fuckin cover up. </p></p>

<p><p>I'm 19. I'm from India. Even though I'm pretty familiar with other countries, some stuff (especially things people don't talk about) have slipped through my radar. </p>
<p>Plus,</p>
<p>I mean tell a normal person that there is a child sex ring operated and funded by politicians who distribute images publicly on Twitter. </p>
<p>See if anyone not drunk or smelly takes you even a little bit seriously. </p>
<p>But this time the evidence is actually there. </p>
<p>Holy shit. </p></p>

<p><p>The evidence has always been there. Especially with 9/11. The sad truth is that people don't even bother to look because of the terribly effective propaganda to label controversial subjects as conspiracy theory, or "lizard people territory".</p></p>

<p>I live in India. I've spent my entire life online. If a script kiddie could find my address from Orkut, how tough would it be for the government? Do you think that they don't already know what I'm doing? I could disappear at any second if it actually ever happened (which might be too paranoid for my taste). I've done nothing illegal. I haven't opened the NSFL links publicly. Best to have a record of yourself. You can't stop the signal. </p>

<p>Thanks mate. Would have been really helpful 5 hours ago when I collected info from a dozen sources. Sadly I somehow didn't realize that a subreddit existed. </p></p>

<p><p>This is precisely how I feel as well. I've always been deeply skeptical of anything conspiracy-theory-ish. I haven't come to any definite conclusions here yet, but it is far more convincing than I'd like it to be. The possibility that I'm either totally delusional or way dumber than I thought I was is infinitely preferable to the possibility that any of this is real. </p></p>
