<hr>
<p><strong>Part I: "Going down the rabbit hole"</strong></p>
<p>I have followed conspiracies for some time. It's mysterious, scary, even fun. Sometimes you wonder what the hell you're getting into. Sometimes you wonder how much to take any of it seriously. For a lot of you this is new and there is an understandable level of skepticism, as well as paranoia. For Pizzagate, as it has become known as, to be as effective as it can be, some of you are going to need to calm down and learn to be as objective as possible.</p>
<p>I know that isn't easy. I've also seen it said that even with all the videos, infographics and so on, there isn't really as of yet any really well presented media that lays it all out without, shall we say, looking somewhat idiotic in the process. That's because for every worthwhile piece of info out there, there are a thousand others which grasp at straws. I do it from time to time too. For the skeptics, don't let that dishearten you. It's called leaving no stone unturned.</p>
<p>Sometimes people will read a comment somewhere, isn't there a child crying in the background of that video? And suddenly, there are 50 Reddit threads about it, dissecting it piece by piece, running audio analysis and so forth. That's good! But it can be embarassing too. Because what if it's nothing? And usually it is. But it might be something.  The same happened with the video of Biden which appeared to show him saying that he was horny to a young girl. Several people tried to clean up that audio and prove it conclusively.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can't. And perhaps you can't prove anything about Comet Ping Pong, Besta Pizza, or even the Podestas either purely through what is available on the internet. What it does certainly show is patterns of suspicious behavior. Human beings are great at seeing patterns. That is investigation. It's puzzle solving. But I think everyone here and elsewhere, 4chan etc who is genuinely interested in exposing sickos, are going to have to do better. </p>
<p>This is not actually about pizza, it is mainly about corrupt people in power and pedophiles. The power structure is not only related to Podesta, the Clintons, or even government, it is in Hollywood, it is anywhere where there is a tonne of money and influence. Pizzagate is just a name that's catchy. People have said it should be called pedogate or podestagate, and I disagree because those are not relatable nor do they speak to peoples curiosity. If you want to get someone curious, just get them to ask "How the hell does pizza relate to pedophile rings?!"</p>
<p>These other names also do not speak about the overall problem. Pizza however, is not really an attack on any one person or organization. It's a pattern that's been repeated in many places. Whether it's coincidence or actually a real code they use is by now, beside the point.</p>
<p>But, you do need to do better. Announcing everything you are going to do before you do it, for example, is just moronic. Anyway, moving on...</p>
<p><strong>Part II: Pedophile rings are a thing</strong></p>
<p>This shit obviously is happening, whether or not Comet or Besta or anyone else often discussed here is guilty. And powerful people are involved. Many of the biggest perpetrators are probably not so powerful or famous, and therefore it's not as tempting, or easy for that matter, to go after them.</p>
<p>But make no mistake: The big fish rely on the little ones to keep their well oiled machine going. Massive busts have already happened throughout the world including Australia and Europe. Jeffrey Epstein has been outed and convicted. And it would be foolish to think that this isn't only the beginning.</p>
<p>There is ongoing investigation by FBI and other law enforcement into foreign nationals (Americans and others) operating out of Thailand for example, likely to escape further scrutiny in the US, as well as the amount of open underage prostitution which occurs there. I believe that many of these people were formerly operating out of the USA, especially around Calfornia and Washington State, and some still have ties with businesses still in operation in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Part III: Liberal media &amp; What happened at Fire Island Pines</strong></p>
<p>Who is behind these rings? That's what we'd all like to know. This is a touchy subject depending on your political leaning and personal beliefs. There are mountains of evidence suggesting that these rings have heavy involvement by one particular group in power. </p>
<p>We're all aware of past scandals such as with the catholic church, and it's likely that there has been some corruption of every powerful institution regardless of whether it leans left or right. People in power are in the position to abuse, period.</p>
<p>But it isn't the church these days which influences youth and society at large. The film, television and music industries are where that happens. These industries are largely responsible for why we have moved well beyond gays being more accepted and gaining equal rights, to large portions of the population especially in younger groups such as millennials being convinced that they are genderfluid pansexuals, and they're "born that way" like Lady Gaga loves to say. Lady Gaga of course, being an influential pop "artist" (more on that soon) with more than her share of illuminati style references to be found, also very good buddies with Marina Abramovic. </p>
<p>In terms of news, CNN, a heavy liberal leaning news network, like many others owned by the same people, push these agendas in any way they can.</p>
<p>In August 2016, CNN ran a piece on the old gay community of Fire Island Pines, lamenting how its culture would disappear forever, with its beautiful architecture. Fire Island Pines, however, was very similar to these place like the ones Epstein, the Clintons, and others frequent. Places where sexual practices that wouldn't be acceptable to the typical citizen can occur without fear.</p>
<p>http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/16/architecture/fire-island-pines-architecture/</p>
<p>"Orgy is a grand old tradition of Fire Island", the article opens, before going on to vehemently defend its so-called values and culture, and calling for it to be preserved. </p>
<p>The article notes that the heavy orgy activity of the community during the late 20th century resulted in nearly everyone being wiped out from AIDS.</p>
<p>Then it concludes: ""Even as it becomes safer for gay people to choose any number of leisure destinations, my hope is for Fire Island to retain its role as a homeland and a rite of passage" he says, "a place where one finds community and a connection to LGBT history. We cannot bring back a lost generation, but we can preserve their most salient artifacts and the environment in which they flourished."</p>
<p>I guess our definitions of "flourishing" must be very different. In my view, this is a place where people went to indulge in hedonistic and probably even occult practices including the sort portrayed in films such as Eyes Wide Shut (more on that soon), and they paid the price. It is also notable that they use the term "rite of passage" in reference to Fire Island, as if to take part in its practices is part of some initiation ritual, especially for younger males, as that is how the term is nearly always used.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that I am not condemning everyone who is liberal, homosexual, pro-homosexual or anything else. Normalizing this specific philosophy of open sexuality however is in itself something different, with a very specific agenda behind it, and millions of youth are falling for it because they are led by their emotions and sense of justice, and can't separate the people they want to protect, from a lifestyle. Protecting the lifestyle has somehow become more important. That is because among the powerful, culture, lifestyle and art is their obsession. </p>
<p>This obsession is widespread among the aristocracy, leaks down to the bourgeoise, and is uncommon in the proleteriat or low-class. Yet the proleteriat tends to parrot the bourgeoise and protect their interests, simply because if they did not, they would lose their job and whatever precious little social standing they have.</p>
<p><strong>Part IV: Satanic Panic?</strong></p>
<p>Whenever the media or liberal decryers of Pizzagate want to make it look stupid, their first line of attack is to compare the hype surrounding it to the Satanic Panic of the southern USA in the 80s and 90s, where one famous case involved the West Memphis Three, led by Damien Echols. The idea was that he was a murderer because of his obsession with Satanic imagery, music and "culture". Of course, it's also commonplace because again, these sort of interests leak down the social ladder as stated earlier. Echols was later released, but who really committed the multiple murders has apparently never been conclusively solved (Terry Hobbs is currently the main suspect). </p>
<p>Today, the idea that liberal leaning homosexuals connected to powerful people must somehow automatically be connected to pedophilia and crime would seem disconcerting to those who are gay but otherwise normal. From their perspective, that may be the primary fuel behind PizzaGate. It may genuinely appear to be an attack on who they are, which may be something they feel is perfectly normal, valid, and something they cannot, and should not, have to change. And it might be valid to compare that to the Satanic panic. </p>
<p>But I don't think it is the goal of most Pizzagate investigators, and it's not mine. There are simply some questions about specific industries which must be answered. If you have read through this entire post carefully, it does not state that one automatically equals the other. It states that there is an agenda to normalize certain activities and shall we say, philosophies, and some forms of cultural norms are more conducive to that than others. </p>
<p>Why that is, is multifaceted. The first reason being that as everything becomes permissible in society, the less anything will be scrutinized. It's telling that ten years ago, if you were to say "what's next, pedophilia will be normalized?" You would be scorned, mocked and ridiculed for even daring to draw the comparison. But now publications like the NY Times, Vice and others are suggesting just that - that pedophilia is not a choice but something you're born with. The next step would be for people to openly come out as child lovers with stories about how they cannot help it, and then after that, a social justice campaign would follow to guilt everyone else into acceptance.</p>
<p>http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/opinion/pedophilia-a-disorder-not-a-crime.html?_r=0</p>
<p>It is actually fitting that this be compared to the satanic panic, because whether or not Echols was guilty in the murders, satanism has long been a bigger part of American culture than is generally accepted.  It was successfully normalized through music and horror film, it became an attractive thing for kids to look into and identify with for its rebellion. It was the perfect tool in that one could just say "Cool it pops! This is just a form of expression".</p>
<p>But at the same time, because of its tenets, it paved the way for society to get carried away with notions of tolerance at the expense of anything else, for again, in satanism's view, everything is acceptable.</p>
<p>So, aren't people justified in their concerns in both cases? Some people do witch hunts because they cannot reason things out calmly. But that does not mean that everyone who is concerned is unreasonable.</p>
<p>This leads us to talk once again, about where we are today, and about "art".</p>
<p><strong>Part V: "Art"</strong></p>
<p>Tony Podesta's sculptures and paintings of kids being abused? Relax! It's just "art"! Marina Abramovic's rituals involving drinking semen and breast milk, and painting in blood? Fool, that's just art!
Arrington de Dionyso's orgy decapitation ritual sacrifice paintings, one of which he recreated for Comet Ping Pong? You Satanic Panic Bigot! That is clearly ART!</p>
<p>NSFW. And more on the tigers later. Since this post is getting very long already, I may reply further to explain that and other things in more detail, including connections to the film Eyes Wide Shut, and other references in film (also "just art" if you want it to be!)... possibly some other areas.</p>

https://i.imgsafe.org/faa401607c.jpg That's what an "old school pizzeria" is all about, guys! They sure are obsessed with pizza, whether or not pizza is actually central to any of this. </p>
<p>What are your feelings after viewing these images? Are you shocked? Are you furious? Or are you laughing because this is all just so clearly misunderstood? </p>
<p>There is more to all this art than Satanism, though. There are many who would deny that this has anything to do at all with Satan. Even those genuinely interested in the overarching conspiracy may deny the existence or relevance of "Satan". It is true that there is much more involved here than some simplified notion of a laughing, horned devil orchestrating this from the depths of hell. It is true that just because something is called esoteric or occult, it does not necessarily mean its practitioners believe they are involved in evil. They may in fact see themselves as good. And, on a case by case, basis, who is to say, really?</p>
<p>But on a case by case basis, you can also see when something is obviously wrong. There are a lot of people involved in psychedelic culture; for those who are, you can likely see the obsession with psychedelics in Dionyso's work, and how it plays a role in the spiritual elements of this occult belief system. From the Christian perspective, it is all Satanism, and anything else is getting caught in a trap of semantics. Because what it teaches is that such tools are a gateway. And that is also what every piece of psychedelic literature you will ever read, will also readily admit. </p>
<p>This doesn't mean that everyone who is into psychedelics is a Satanist. Those who are into it for fun and or self exploration though, would themselves do well to read up on the CIA's role in the psychedelic scene, the role of that in the creation of the era of sexual liberation, including these aforementioned orgy communities where copious amount of substances such as LSD were consumed, what major figures were involved, and what they have pushed into the public consciousness. Question how what you have taken for granted your entire life might relate to how these things that you now see for the first time and realize in horror are generally allowed to happen on a daily basis, in plain sight.</p>
<p>What is evil? What is "satanism"? Is it a great big bogeyman, or is it something we all potentially play a role in and have the power to affect? For some strange reason, few who believe in evil and fight it want to think so.</p>
<p><strong>Part VI: Conclusion to this post</strong></p>
<p>Obviously, this is all quite the big rabbit hole, red pill, whatever you want to call it, for some. For others it's old news. Still others, like I said will feel attacked by all this. Some possibly for good reason, some not. For those of you who genuinely try to be good people and still feel under attack, perhaps it's unfair. I do think we should all make the effort to understand each other and understand why a person has come to live as they do, without judgment or sending a lynch mob after them. For those actively trying to participate and play detective and do their part to make the world a better place, I recommend taking your time to gather real and relevant information, don't just rehash what you've heard and are suddenly excited about. Chances are, most of us have already read whatever it is you're excited about and think everyone needs to hear.</p>
<p>If there are pedos out there to be found who are preying on children, I do believe someone needs to expose them. And wherever there is corruption, that should be exposed. I wonder about whether sites like Reddit and 4chan, organizations like Anonymous or any other big internet movement is the best way to do it. Maybe it is, since society has become the way it has, and law enforcement agencies themselves are so compromised. </p>
<p>In its infancy, any movement is bound to be volatile, infantile, and also vulnerable. I think something good is going to come of it no matter what. It's just a question of whether it can live up to its full potential. My motivation in making this post has been to hopefully open some of your eyes to a wider perspective. It is up to you to decide how you use this information to shape how you approach all this from here. I will not be making any other posts, only possibly responses and elaborations to this thread.</p>
<p>Good day. Time for some football and beer.</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Come on. As a gay person, this is totally alienating. "Mountains of evidence"?? Right. You said it yourself, it's a touchy subject, but it has nothing to do with religion, just as the child-trafficking element has little to do with homosexuality. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, the idea that liberal leaning homosexuals connected to powerful people must automatically be connected to pedophilia and crime must seem disconcerting to some.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because it's fucking stupid. Stop lumping the two together, they aren't related. I'm just as appalled by the exploitation of children as any heterosexual here, and your narrative is ridiculous. </p></p>

        <p><p>You read the last part wrong. Perhaps I was not as clear as I could have been. When I said "the idea that liberal leaning homosexuals connected to powerful people must automatically be connected to pedophilia and crime must seem disconcerting to some", that was not a statement that I make a 1 to 1 comparison, it is a statement that gays probably feel more targeted because Alefantis is a representative of the gay scene, being connected by PizzaGate people with pedophiles.</p>
<p>Remember, nowhere did I say that every homosexual is pedophile (I'm sure that by and large, most are not), and nowhere did I say that every pedophile is homosexual. Especially since it happens between grown men and young girls, or grown women and boys. </p>
<p>Still, it is coming out more and more that people involved are often gay or bisexual. There is a pattern. In Hollywood, Brock Pierce who was a part of DEN "Digital Entertainment Network" created shows which promoted young boys being mentored by gay communities in Hollywood and turning against their Christian parents, who were portrayed as bigoted in overly exaggerated manner. Brock Pierce is now owner of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Bryan Singer is well known as a pedophile involved in the same group. The documentary An Open Secret goes into considerable detail on these and other cases.</p>
<p>I have worked with a lot of people in Hollywood and that region in general where gay culture is openly celebrated, and there are multiple occasions where I encountered scenarios where it turned out that they were not only gay, but interested in children in a creepy way. I will not, however, say anything directly about them, because I have no conclusive proof of any specific crimes. This is likely the same reason many others remain free.</p>
<p>Accusers of the Clintons also state that both of them are Bi. This doesn't mean it is true, but it does add to the growing body of information. It's not "my" narrative. It's simply what everyone who bothers to look is beginning to notice.</p>
<p>I understand if that bothers you, but there's not much I can do about that, sorry. And by the way, if the church deserves scrutiny, then so do these industries, and that is the point of mentioning the connection.</p></p>

        <p><p>I think you're distracting from this investigation by making a false correlation between gay people and paedophiles. You could make the same argument if you swapped gay for white. </p>
<p>It's very important to keep the focus on investigating the actual crimes being committed here, and by bringing your political views into it you're diluting the efforts being made. </p>
<p>You're also opening the investigation up to people claiming that this is just the alt right going nuts, which it isn't.</p></p>

        <p><p>If anyone is not willing to look at it in context, and resort to saying I am attacking gays with broad brush strokes, then they are going to say what they say and I have no further reason to respond to it. All it would do is give them the attention they want. This is the last I am going to address the "gay" issue:</p>
<p>Most people here are convinced that there is a large conspiracy going on in the highest levels, but what is the point of it? This may sound convenient, but I am neither left nor right. I have some beliefs which would be considered liberal, and others which would be considered conservative. For me, it's not so much about Hillary. It's about how and why these sick references are so commonplace. Read part VII and VII B and see if you feel differently.</p>
<p>Sexuality seems to be a big part, in their occult belief systems, of what gives them power. Making various forms of sexuality more normalized enables them to carry on more easily. Do you think they want to hide and do these things on remote islands, or in back rooms or underground tunnels? Do you think they're not worried that they'll be exposed? Do you think that this has not been going on for decades, even centuries, and they haven't looked for ways to avoid having to watch their backs?</p>
<p>Fire Island was mentioned for a reason, as well as the CNN article which covered it. It doesn't just promote homosexuality or say "hey, leave these guys alone, they're just normal people." It indicates that they are very well to do people who loved huge sex parties, very similar to what PizzaGate is investigating. And for whatever reason, CNN is defending their practices, just as it defends those involved in Pizzagate and is leading the push to shut down alternative news which it has the nerve to deem FAKE for investigating these people.</p>
<p>Do you really see no relation? And what "actual crimes" are you suggesting we focus on? The whole problem is that there are very few specific crimes anyone can point out, only a lot of dot connecting pizzas and hotdogs with pedophilia. Which isn't out of the question, but again, it's not enough. </p>
<p>If you're not willing to ask the hard questions and risk pissing some people off, then ask yourself if you should even bother.</p></p>

        <p><p><strong>Part VII: How &amp; Why Hollywood outs the elite's sick practices</strong></p>
<p>You've probably noticed, but there are a lot of people who say things like "OMG! This is like that movie, Eyes Wide Shut!" Rich people being caught, or suspected of, orgies and private parties involving children. Was that really what the film was about? Why would the film industry out the powers behind it? </p>
<p>I think that the answer is, sometimes they talk about it to make fun of it, make it seem like a conspiracy, and other times, especially as the directors get more disillusioned with the industry, they look for subtle ways to sneak in references to what goes on, to warn people. Things get through the cracks. Eyes Wide Shut came at a time when this wasn't really commonly done or expected. The only other Hollywood director who is known for "outing Hollywood" really, is David Lynch, as can be seen in Mulholland Drive, and nobody really takes his films literally or as coherent narratives, so there's that.</p>
<p>EWS is indeed a film worth examining. There are a few ways that it alludes to sex with underage children, but more disturbingly, we see how this is all tied together with the "elite" and their occult obsessions. I will also tie it to Pizzagate directly before this is over, and other symbolism that is used besides food. I suggest watching the film before reading this, but it's not really necessary to understand.</p>
<p>So. to start, the direct relations to pedophilia and raising sex slaves. Leelee Sobieski's character, the underage daughter of the costume shop owner, is caught with two old asian men, and it's later hinted that the owner is actually pimping out his own daughter. Also, she whispers something to Bill Harford about what he should wear to the party, indicating that she's been there.</p>
<p>Bill meets a hooker named "Domino" (relation to pizza or the reference to Dominos in the emails may or may not be completely coincidental) who owns a large stuffed tiger doll. Keep that detail in mind, and refer to my earlier post of Dionyso's work. Tigers are major sex slave symbolism.</p>
<p>There are hints throughout the film that Alice Harford may be grooming their own daughter to be the next sex slave kitten, and that she herself actually attends the parties sometimes, but either keeps it hidden from Bill or has disassociated. There are a few ways this is shown, but among other things, again they associate the tiger dolls with the daughter at the toy store as they do Domino, and she also wears butterfly wings at one point, associated with Monarch programming.</p>
<p>There is an unusual detail I have noticed personally, and that is what we don't see talked about on the web regarding this film, as much as what we do see. For example, any image search you do anywhere for Eyes Wide Shut masks, and you will never see certain designs, even though they are prominent in the film. I believe that this is because they are actually used in these practices and it might be censored from search engines. Of course, I cannot prove this but it is unusual.</p>
<p>What you will find a lot of, is the mask Bill wears, all other Venetian masks, Red Cloak's mask, and the ones the people on the balcony wear. What you never see, and can not easily identify, are the two which are semi egyptian looking, with a part which is crownlike, and one which has winglike protrusions.</p>
<p>Again refer to the work of Dionyso who does the mural at Comet, and you will see a similar look on many of the females in the orgy pieces where they are having sex with demons and tigers. Many of these females also have wings sticking out of their heads, and crowns. This appears to have some sort of occult significance, but on a deeper level than is easily available to examine to the public, so much as I can see. </p>
<p>I believe that TPTB were angry when they screened the film and saw such details, but they had made a major financial investment, and Kubrick had such influence that they knew they could not just destroy it. Some offending details such as these particular masks, were so central to the major scene of the film and they would have had to use some major CGI to cover it and it was financially unfeasible. So they left it, and probably hoped that people would ignore it. Other things were removed or censored. Apparently a shot with a large pentagram was removed. For the initial theater release, the hardcore sex was covered by simple shadowy silhouettes. It is believed that somewhere in the ballpark of half an hour of footage was cut out altogether, and the film ended with Alice stating that they needed to "fuck" to underscore that it was really just about their marriage and infidelity, as the book was which it was based on.</p>
<p>Still, likely because of what the film does reveal, two major heads of Warner Bros were pressured to leave, since they were the ones who greenlit the whole thing under the impression that it was loyal to the book and its plot. I believe that they were shocked when they saw the end result. And we all know what happened to Kubrick. </p>
<p>The reason artists such as Arrington de Dionyso gets away with revealing what they do today is because it is "art", and besides this, since EWS entered the public consciousness, the strategy has gradually changed, and revealing some of their beliefs and symbolism out in the open has all become part of the game they play.</p>
<p><strong>Part VII B: The After Party and Real Life PizzaGate Events</strong></p>
<p>People have furiously dug through the WikiLeaks emails for any reference to illegal activity or a smoking gun that would put some behind bars and shake things up. Do we have that? It remains to be seen. Sometimes, it seems a little wrong in itself that the world is now snooping through someones e-mails which originally was used for political purposes. For many, it still is political. But now it's public, and what has been seen cannot be unseen.</p>
<p>It's true, the pizza and food references are all really, really strange. But could it just be a bunch of coincidences? Maybe. We've seen so many strange connections though, that it is difficult to ignore. And what about when we look further into any potential occult practices which thusfar may have been ignored? EWS as a film offers us an important insight into the way powerful people conduct their nightlife.</p>
<p>David Brock invites Podesta to an "After After Party". What is that, you may ask? Well, in EWS, The movie begins with a party which seems on the up and up, but some people are already going upstairs and having sex, including Ziegler. Usually it's kept well under wraps, but since the hooker nearly ODs right there, Ziegler suddenly has a major problem on his hands since he has to also play host and mingle, or it will look strange.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the context of the film, there is the party and the After party. This is where only those in the know go for the "real" action. The occult ritual and huge orgy.</p>
<p>In real life, David Brock of Clinton's campaign invites Podesta to one of these in an e-mail. Podesta politely declines, claiming "Way past my bedtime". He begins to publicly distance himself from Brock. Probably in part because he may have thought Brock was an idiot for sending him such an invite via email, whether he actually refused or ended up going. He clearly did not want to be able to be easily connected to it.</p>
<p>And, that about sums things up. Between Spirit cooking, the connection to businesses using pedophile symbols, connections to people like Epstein, David Brock, Brock Pierce, with detailed accusations by whistleblowers like Cathy O'Brien against the Clintons, and more, we see what is considered normal culture by these people, represented in their art and in their tastes... is Trump involved? I wouldn't be surprised about that, either. It seems unlikely that anyone who manages to become a major presidential candidate, is not involved in some way in things that the average American would find unconscionable. </p>
<p>So what to do with all of these suggestions? Keep researching, and maybe in the process, the corrupt will be taken down. And at the very least, you stand a chance of putting some of the power to control the direction of this country back in the hands of its people.</p></p>

        <p><p>I hope you guys can piece this together, there is a certian group of people (their names echoes) that is always connected to pedophilia. Just follow their trail and you will find pedophile case after pedophile case. I think it all goes back to king solomon and they still follow his sick religion.</p></p>
