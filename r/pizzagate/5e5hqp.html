    The last post she posted was about how she was getting ready to release part 2.

    I have archives of her posts prior to those last posts. Did anyone else archive after me?

      No no they absolutely should suspend these accounts, but they did it all at once.  In one fell swoop they suspended over ten thousand accounts.  What do you think is more likely:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>
        This was the first they were hearing about this massive web of pedophilia across 10k accounts
        <strong>
         OR
        </strong>
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        They knew all along, were ignoring/protecting these accounts and pruning them from getting caught in the search filters.  I mean for fucks sake if you search the wrong term on google you automatically get flagged with the chilling effects link, there's no way these accounts have existed this long without twitter being aware of them.  They are a news aggregate they survive off finding terms that accounts are using to communicate.
       </p>
      </li>
     </ol>

       Could they have been suspended because people reported them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to the election there were a lot of people of the same political affiliation getting shadow banned. It could've been Twitter systematically oppressing political views, but I think it's more likely that people of other viewpoints were reporting everyone they saw with a different viewpoint, and the Twitter system shadow banned them because it got multiple reports. Maybe that's similar to what's happening here.

        25 thousand fucking kiddie porn accounts. Twitter should SHUT DOWN immediately. They need to suspend the entire service and make a pu license announcement inmediately.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pretending nothing has happened is part of the cover up! We should be at twitter headquarters protesting now! We can't wait for the media to decide this is newsworthy.

        Something in the order of 25k accounts?  I don't think so.  When I got my hands on the list I started running them down and a fair number of them were banned, but at least an equal number were not.  Those were the result of people reporting.  The mass banning that banned every single account on the list was clearly from higher above.

        Only that about an hour ago I was sifting through and suddenly all of them are banned.  Not sure how to tell what times they were banned.

         Either way I think it's a good thing they're suspended and pointless to suggest the suspensions are part of a cover up. Having said that, I don't deny the fact Twitter are trying to sweep this under the carpet in other ways and I think we should focus more on that

       Honestly 1. I think it was probably someone at Twitter found out about this, freaked the fuck out over being potentially charged for hosting child porn or even just the potential PR shitstorm, and just cleaned house.

       It's true that aside from the very blatant images which were up-front, there were also very obvious keywords in the description boxes such as "gay kids", shota kids" etc. (that's what I saw from YouAreBeingLiedTo's screenshots at least).
      </p>
      <p>
       How comes that twitter, who wants to ban right-wing accounts (which requires research in order to determine the political opinion of each user) couldn't see the pedo network???? FISHY AS HELL

      They didnt suspend every account on the list. Just the accounts she mentioned publicly. There's over 25,000 accounts not suspended currently. And they also suspended her later not at the same time (so it most likely is a manual suspension or through people reporting her). By coincidence it also lines up to when she said she was going to release part 2 of more accounts.

        This is what I'm saying though, they
        <em>
         did
        </em>
        just suspend them all.  First just the ones that were mentioned on twitter but now literally all of them.

       I've been randomly cherrypicking from the list.  Every single account I found has been suspended.  I had left some open in tabs, refresh, suspended.  They went straight down the list.

        I for one am pretty damn glad they're being suspended. The real story is how they were there in the first place

         And for so long.  I mean come on twitter you are literally a giant word-cloud, there's no way you didn't have something to catch these sort of things.  For fucks sake you were banning alt-right accounts out of the gate but can't find years old pedo sharing accounts?

    i had my doubts on the whole pizzagate thing, thinking it was some stupid alt right conspiratard's delusion....however after reading this sub, slowly and slowly i believe that this might be real. So many things that don't make sense here, so many cover ups...it just makes me very suspicious.
   </p>
   <p>
    I apologize for thinking you were all crazy and misinformed, i believe you are on to something here. Let's hope you guys succeed.

    What her/his list is about? The 15/25k list is about the followers of some pedo tweeter accounts, am i right? And how much are these last ones? because i tried to browse trough many of the master list accounts and i found a lot of porn, but nothing incriminating (though many tweets were deleted or account in private mode). Came too late?

      Many of the accounts were fine, they were just following. Other accounts had regular porn. Then a few I found had some of the really fucked up shit.
     </p>

      Hammers come down now, all the accounts are gone.

     I mean good on free speech and all, but I hope they plan to censor things that are actually disgusting and illegal though. There's probably a happy medium of censorship that is perfectly ok.

      It will come :)  They roll out in waves.  Until servers can handle more.  Slowly upgrading servers.  We have been under heavy denial of service attacks lately, because we are taking on twitter.

    Oh yeah, this idiot is sharing an index of CP and thinks she won't get banned
   </p>
   <p>
    Twitter bans on demand, If you see something you flag not share. If she shared a list, they had the chance to look it up. She still broke the rules by sharing.

    It's good that they were suspended. What's the problem? OK from a LE POV they're no longer up, but it DOES mean that twitter have acknowledged it (they're still cunts) and they and the leaker have details of those accounts.

    Here's more accounts not suspended 
@DailyTwinks
@Liberty4LGBT
@Euroboys
And all other these accounts have thousands of followers plus follow many themselves. I need help reporting them all. Not all are child exploitation but many are. They have to be investigated

    Devil's advocate: is it possible to have just written a script that gave removed twitter accounts that had followed other removed twitter accounts?  I don't believe I've seen anything or anyone with any public credibility confirm these had CP on them.

     They were following pedophiles. So either they're bots or they're real human beings. Either ways, they are following someone who is tweeting CP. That by definition makes them pedophiles. Regardless they are following someone who is breaking the law. (Perhaps not all countries but this is taboo for the majority of people)

       She links the code she used to compile the list. Algo is based off of followers and related followers from what I can tell. A sort of triangulation of sorts.

        how many main accounts where there that were actually the ones tweeting it? and i wonder how old those accounts were. Id imagine they would have to be around for a while to get that many followers, but this could definitely be some sort of targeted way for the government to keep tabs on all the pedophiles around by honeypotting with a few accounts and tracking all the followers.

      Even after the bans half her master list of "suppliers" hasn't been suspended, because oddly enough its not cp. 4 were banned (one of which had no cp but was running an escort service, one locked before I saw it), one is full gay, and 3 remain untouched and will probably stay that way as theres nothing there.
