   <strong>
    "All ages" shows at Cosmic Ping Pong are not necessarily suspicious
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    There are people on here turning up tons of great leads, but i just wanted to interject and state that a venue that has a live band is perfectly normal to have "all ages" shows.  This isn't geared towards 9 year olds.  At least in my experience.  I am sure a lot of people on here have seen it.  I grew up as a teenager going to a lot of punk rock and hardcore shows.  As anyone in any underground music scene is aware, often many of the good bands play in 21+ drinking establishments.  Big bummer for the younger fan base.  So it is totally common for any of these bands to play 
"all ages" shows so they can perform to a fan base that has a lot of 14-20 year olds.
   </p>
   <p>
    That being said, for a place that advertises as child friendly, the artwork is extremely inappropriate and sketchy as hell.

      If you are not a shill, then you have not researched these bands very well.

      The video of Heavy Breathing's lead, Amanda Kleinman, making pedo jokes on stage is the best part.

       I was STRICTLY referring to the nature of all ages shows, and how some have pointed that out as strange.  As others have pointed out as well, the bands themselves can definitely give a hint to what's going on.  I agree, Kleinman is suspicious as hell, and that weird birthday party video is one of the first things after the emails that really sucked me into this story

     Shows advertising as all ages are EXTREMELY common.  One of the local bars in my town always have shows marketed as 21+ because they're in a bar, while one of the venues not in a drinking establishment almost always advertises as all ages.  I'm guessing you're not American?

     I imagine that would be similar to if I was in New York and saw a restaurant bar venue with fliers of a G.G. Allin show coming up.  Yeah, pretty damn inappropriate for my kid to see

     Sorry for the dated reference, but I don't pay attention to who the edgy shitbag is today

     That show didn't start till 10 pm so 7 year olds in attendance is rather unlikely.

    Is it normal to tape toddlers to the table and take pictures to add to your creepy instagram history that is either the least funny joke ever made or evidence of unnatural love for minors at venues that are all ages? If so, case closed.

      That was exactly my point, thanks.  I agree the acts are a bit more troubling, just trying to look at everything objectively.  I would like to hear from someone from the music scene there to get a better gauge of what the vibe there is.  Could be a welcoming and inclusive music scene, or it could be a bunch of sick predators baiting.  Not gonna try to guess without knowing.

       Yes, fine. Let's go with the idea of simple alienating the idea that it's just a free and creative space. The next tier of information pushes this theory on its side.

     Agreed.  Definitely not trying to say "Nothing to see here!", just trying to point out logical explanations when it is appropriate.  It is easy to get caught up in everything, and assume everything is sinister.
    </p>
    <p>
     For instance, to illustrate the opposite, there is no scenario I can imagine where those emails make sense if they were NOT speaking in code

    It's hilarious when I see bands I recognise on fliers associated with this. Namely, Slingshot Dakota and war on women. Trying to find something in nothing all the time with absolutely no proof or anything even mildly suspicious.

    We should treat the shows as POSSIBLE evidence. Too many people here treat them as if they are DEFINITELY suspicious, but they shouldn't be ruled out.
