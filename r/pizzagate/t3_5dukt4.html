<p><p>Has the tide shifted?  Can we win this or is this fight all in vain?</p></p>

<p><p>Absolutely man, this is among the fastest growing sub reddits out there. People from all countries (Turkey, Poland, Egypt, US, England, Australia) are starting to connect the dots. It's an awakening on a global scale. Keep fighting, we are winning!</p></p>

<p><p>Winning really needs clarity. If by winning you mean destroying the US Establishment's reputation on a global level, then you are probably going to win as it inevitably becomes more popular around the world as people come upon it and meme it in their own language.
It's horrible what is happening and it is probably not just occuring in the UsA. It is probably common amongst ,  "leaders" and rich do-nothings, and all this coming to light means they're gonna fight back, indubiously. If the law won't stop it that should be telling enough, and foreign governments have yet to mention anything either, when surely there must be some foreign country which would love to humiliate the USA and somehow justify their own abuses. This probably goes very deep, and it is no coincidence all this Assange stuff happened after the pizza emails started coming out.</p>
<p>With this info out in the light, the establishment goal is not "how can we win the consent of people?" as no sane person (who was presented evidence) would accept this crap, but "how can I maintain control?". </p>
<p>Just my 2 cents. Of course, I am NOT endorsing keeping quiet about it. The truth must be set free despite what happens. </p></p>

<p><p>I agree with this. I think we can "win" in terms of possibly getting this story out there on a wide scale and having a great deal of people begin to suspect or believe that it's all true. But then the real win or lose challenge comes: what will the FBI/DOJ/Trump administration do at that point, when public opinion has truly shifted to acknowledging the reality of pizzagate? Will foreign government leaders say anything, or brush it under the rug because they too are implicated?</p></p>

<p><p>Winning can just be spreading this information and letting people decide for themselves. </p></p>

<p><p>No. Not if "we" means people on reddit. We can make a public case that Tony Podesta is hella creepy; that Alefantis has, at best, weird taste in art and poor taste in humor; that maybe some of these people are more seriously into satanism that most people would find comfortable. Unfortunately, none of that is illegal. Unless somebody has some hard evidence, nothing is going to happen to anybody; hard evidence would require warrants and subpoenas; and warrants and subpoenas require judges and cops. Maybe there is something on Weiner's laptop, or maybe Wikileaks really does have more info to release. Maybe people are holding out until the DOJ starts working again. I don't know. I hope so!</p></p>

<p><p>Indeed. I don't think that reddit/4chan etc will find the "smoking gun" here, but the connections made helps in spreading the message. Have to see what FBI found on Weiner's laptop once they are finished with the investigation. Might be some really damaging stuff, if the rumors about the "life insurance"-folder on the laptop is true.</p>
<p>If one of the people connected gets taken down, then it will bring in more pressure to FBI/NYPD to investigate the people who are connected in some way(using similar code-words found in Podesta e-mails, if they are indeed codewords. Symbolism etc).</p>
<p>edit: I'd like to be proven wrong about the smoking gun, but the people being investigated have most likely deleted incriminating stuff from the internet, if they are using the internet for sending each other CP(Like John.com, or the Upload/Download members-area in the comet's website). </p></p>
