<strong>Let's shine a light on Donald Sussman. Founder of Paloma Partners, top contributor to HRC campaign, media mogul, tax evading resident of USVI, former husband of congresswoman Pingree, associate of Epstien, caught bribing DOJ...</strong>
<p><p>I had never heard of him. </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sussman</p>
<p>Apparently a top contributor to Clinton campaign ($20 million) and owns a lot of media in Maine and Portland.</p>

<p>2012 Bribing the DOJ, VI resident, private plane, shares a lawyer with Epstien. This lawyer Paul Hoffman was a contributor to Chellie Pingree's campaign (Sussmans wife). What kind of lawyer pays his clients?</p>

<p>Donated his private jet after the Haiti Earthquake. Frequently flew the Chair of the Financial Services Committee Barney Frank to his VI properties.</p>
<p>I dunno, sounds suss, man. Got any juice?</p></p>
