<p><p>My apologies, in my haste I mistakenly callled this point of overlap Dupont. It is not Dupont, but an overlap with the Capitol Traction Company street car line. While not a direct "tunnel" in the sense of Dupont, there would undoubtedly be remnants of the conversion to electric tracks. There are many manhole covers in this area. It would be expoloitable.</p></p>

<p><p>This is an updated repost. My original crop of the map was the wrong location. Here is the underground map directly next to the same area on google maps.</p>
<p>This is taken from a much larger map of DC I found when trying to find the other map being passed around. Does this confirm connections to BP/CPP?

<p><p>That map is of the general streetcar network. None of these street cars operated fully underground. I have yet to find any sites that reference the dupont circle tunnels extending more than a mile or two from dupont circle itself.</p>
<p>The dupont tunnels are not really that far reaching since it was a somewhat short section that was put underground so as to not clog up the park space above it.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the location on Connecticut Ave where Comet Ping Pong is is a little over 4-1/2 miles away from Dupont circle. That portion of the streetcar route was above ground according to everything I can find.</p>
<p>If you want to find tunnels under that area in Chevy Chase they are likely to be utilities of some kind or potentially the Broad Branch River Tunnel. </p></p>

<p><p>good point.
The red line (nowadays metro) makes  a remarkable  curve between Tenleytown and Van Ness UDC.  The red Line was all the time on conneticut Ave and from the distance the new stop could ve been on the conneticut/nebraska cross where Comet Ping Pong is. On that cross there are many, many manholes. 2 houses from Comet Ping Pong there is a house that was build 1984. maybe they tried the black line i have painted in the picture.

<p><p>I would not try too hard to prove there is a connection to the red line from the location of Comet Ping pong simply because the metro system is quite a bit deeper under ground than you could ever reasonably reach from anything else without having to excavate an absurd amount of earth. 
The metro was built deep enough as to not disturb the existing public works infrastructure, so there are almost no overlaps or joint connections between the metro itself and other underground networks. It's more realistic to assume that the utility network (which is barely subsurface) would be useful for moving things from one part of a city block to another. So long as you knew when you could get away with doing so.</p></p>

<p><p>You are absolutely right. Sometimes one intends to try to hard bcs a lot of time invested. I don't think there is any prove for underground yet. I do though think to have found evidence that they connected the Comet or one of his neighbours to other facilities there would like to hear your opinion https://imgur.com/a/kRg5B</p></p>

<p><p>If you want to confirm the address that the work was done inside you can use the chamber of commerce site for DC to pull the permit info.</p>
<p>https://pivsservices.dcra.dc.gov/PIVS/Search.aspx</p>
<p>Using it I found the owner of Little Red Fox</p>
<p>Little Red Fox LLC Ownership</p>
<blockquote>
<p>COHEN BARRY R from Bedford, MA</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Buck's Camping &amp; Fishing (5031 Connecticut Ave) was filed by the firm H A GILL &amp; Son Real Estate Service. It has NO PERMITS ON RECORD, so if they did any work in their basement it wasn't done legally.</p>
<p>The same seems to be the case for Comet Ping Pong. They have NO PERMITS ON RECORD.</p>
<p>If James Alefantis took these photos in either location no permit was filed or approved for the work.</p></p>

<p><p>You are on 8ch too? </p>
<p>Nobody seems to get what my pictures where about. I wanted to know WHERE this picture was taken.</p>
<p>Given the fact that there:
- is a door with daylight.
- a steel carrier for the roof (is in comet parallel to conneticut ave)
- and a opened double wall</p>
<p>now look at the "above picture"  you can exclude that this is taken inside comet. </p>
<p>Inside comet it would have to be at the very end of the house to fit the daylight door and steel carrier. (the front it isn't ,obviously)
but then it wouldn't have a double walled door to the right into another house.  </p></p>

<p><p>I'm on both chans. Buck's and Comet Ping Pong both have basements, and I'm not confident that the photo is of a door that leads outside. The photo could be taken in low light conditions and that door might be into a rood with a much brighter light sources.
Comet Ping Pong is also part of a longer building and without recon of the area I'm not sure what the north side of their building is like or if it has any doors from the basement level. Did you try looking at it on streetview from that angle?</p>
<p>It may not matter which of the two the photo was taken in given that the work was done without a permit anyways.</p></p>

<p><p>Whatever work was being done spanned multiple businesses. If this was done in Buck's that would mean that they cut through the wall and into the basement of Besta Pizza.</p>
<p>Which would make sense given that if you look on the shelves through that doorway you see the insulated carriers that pizza delivery places use. And Besta delivers pizza, but Comet Ping Pong does not, so they wouldn't have any of those.</p>
<p>So I think you've confirmed the location of these photos. And SURPRISE Besta Pizza also has NO PERMITS on file when I check PIVS.</p>
<p>These images coupled with the hidden bathroom door at Comet Ping Pong tell me that there may still be a hidden doorway in the basement lounge of Buck's that links it to Besta Pizza.</p></p>

<p><p>The tunnel extends from Dupont Circle all the way to Raven Mountain Complex by PA boreder. If you view on google maps you will find the tunnels exit. This is where President goes as the tunnels heading the other way go to the whitehouse.</p></p>
