    Discovered more weird connections: The office of Clinton's construction company that assisted with shady renovations, Carl Petty Associates, is located 0.8 miles from Comet Ping Pong near another suspicious pizzeria
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I was looking into construction companies linked to any of the pizzagate suspects as I figured there must be some shady contractors helping them build any weird underground sex rooms or whatever you want to call them. I came across these two articles explaining the very rushed renovations done on the new house the Clinton's bought next door to their other one in NY:
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/us/politics/chappaqua-clinton-home.html?_r=0
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.lohud.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/28/hillary-clinton-permit-violations-5-things-know/92895382/
   </p>
   <p>
    The whole thing sounds suspicious. They mention it started out as just a "paint job", but then turned into a full reno? That's odd to me. Anyways, the second article contains a link to the full inspection report which you can read here:
   </p>
   <p>
    https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3197193/Clintons-house-New-Castle-building-inspection.pdf
   </p>
   <p>
    In there I found the names of their director of operation 'Oscar Flores' who oddly enough turns out to be an ex chief culinary specialist for the US Navy Reserve. That in of itself was a bit of a flag to me due to the cooking theories some have about the children. I will try to research him more later. Here's an article on him for those interested:
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/30/that-weekend-the-clintons-took-a-gulfstream-to-honor-their-chef-attend-meeting.html
   </p>
   <p>
    The second thing I found in there was the name of the contractor, Carl Petty Associates to which I discovered have their offices located down the road from Comet Ping Pong. I couldn't find too much more on Carl Petty but maybe someone can dig some more on him. No website for his firm is a bit odd to me as well. Here's his linked in:
https://www.linkedin.com/in/carl-d-petty-p-e-6a955927
   </p>
   <p>
    Then I checked out the Angelico Pizzeria down the road. Nothing stood out to me, but I checked the whois and the registrant name was Angeli on Decatur, which is a pizza place in New Orleans it turns out. I checked the whois for their url, www.angelineworleans.com, and the name is protected but the city and state is Panama. Kind of random! I hit a wall there but I checked out pictures and the menu of the place and it's a bit creepy:
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel baby on the old menu's (they changed in October 2016) https://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/angeli-on-decatur-new-orleans?select=OxK0BFuEG4gEaqx0zoFX9w
   </p>
   <p>
    Some creepy art on walls: https://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/angeli-on-decatur-new-orleans?select=d5LArj4uWw9bEmuwVmAKwQ
   </p>
   <p>
    Lastly, their menu has some interesting demonic pizza names  (see Specialty Pizza's): 
http://places.singleplatform.com/angeli-on-decatur/menu
   </p>
   <p>
    It is New Orleans though where many things are occult so it could be nothing.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sidenote, I also looked into who reno'd the schools between Comet Ping Pong and Carl Petty Associates and it turns out this architecture firm did the renovations for both of them and many others: http://rmc-architects.com/
   </p>
   <p>
    I didn't find anything on the owner Ronnie McGhee though. Looks pretty clean as far as I can see. I would like to look into the people running the schools more just to see.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have to stop digging today, but hopefully this info may help others make more leads.
   </p>

    EDIT ONE:

"A ton (looks like nearly 5 million) of protected domain registrations run though Whoisguard, which is a company that happens to be based in Panama. Private registrations like that hide all of the true registrant's info, that isn't the true city and state 'leaking out'."
   </p>
   <p>
    EDIT TWO:
Upon closer inspection, found a freemason lodge in the same building as the Carl Petty Associates office. Here is there website: http://www.singletonlodge.com/
   </p>
   <p>
    And map location:

    I find it very odd that there's a construction company nextdoor to Comet ping pong.   Nobody would ever think to look inside boxes or crates and see what's inside.

    Jimmycomet instagram had pics of them digging holes in the ground, and what looked to be underground construction.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is old shutdown subway line that just so happens to run right under comet ping pong.
   </p>
   <p>
    Also no construction permits were ever filed for that work.

     Wait, I need pdf's or something of the ols subways... This whole subway Jared shit has got me reeling. I literally think they are using underground netwprls to smuggle children, and there could be a direct line between the Comet area and the White House.

       Carl Petty Associates is right across from the Tenleytown - AU Station. I just discovered a freemason lodge in the same building too. Website: http://www.singletonlodge.com/

    Judging by the names of pizza on Angeli's menu, the owner is either a Luciferian or a Satanist. "Virtuous Angel" = Lucifer in their messed up belief system; I don't need to explain other ones. Definitely worth investigating further. GOOD FIND.

    Interesting, except this bit:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     I checked the whois for their url, www.angelineworleans.com, and the name is protected but the city and state is Panama. Kind of random!
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    A ton (looks like nearly 5 million) of protected domain registrations run though Whoisguard, which is a company that happens to be based in Panama. Private registrations like that hide all of the true registrant's info, that isn't the true city and state 'leaking out'.
