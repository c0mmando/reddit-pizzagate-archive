        <strong>Pizzagate for Dummies? Need help condensing the story for laymen, but more than just a summary.</strong>
        <p><p>Is there a "dumbed down" version of Pizzagate? -- more than just a summary. I know a lot of people on Twitter (and IRL) who don't really understand the overall situation. I've sent them to a few megathreads, but they come away with "It's complicated" or "That's awful! But, I don't really understand."</p>
<p>When I say "dumbed down," I don't mean they're idiots. I only mean they haven't followed along since the beginning and evidently, connecting the dots in one sitting is not for the faint-hearted.</p>
<p>Is there a simplified outline for the novice or layman?</p></p>

        <p><p>Go to top posts last week. There are summaries. You gotta go down the rabbit hole to really get the full picture though.</p></p>

        <p><p>Unfortunately I think some basic proficiency in network, social media, net etiquette, etc. is still required at this moment in time. I think once more damning evidence is leaked, it will be a bit easier to throw in the faces of those not well-versed in net info acquisition.</p>
<p>But that might all change in five minutes when someone finds a smoking bazooka that doesn't have a fog machine behind it.</p></p>

        <p><p>Look at some of the posts from the past few days with pictures in a meme format. They give a general outline of what has been uncovered. Like the one that has police report sketches of 2 people that look like the podesta brothers.</p></p>
