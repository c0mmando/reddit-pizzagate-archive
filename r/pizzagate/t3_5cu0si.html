        <strong>Can we start building a wiki to document all of the evidence in an organized manner?</strong>
        <p><p>We need something that people can reference to quickly and efficiently get up to date on all of the evidence that's been collected. We need to be able to present all of the evidence in an organized fashion. Doing this not only helps newcomers get up to speed, but it also allows everyone who is investigating to have a quick and comprehensive reference, while helping people avoid wasting time digging into and posting information that's already been discovered and analyzed. And who knows... maybe it can even help us connect some more dots that we missed due to the evidence being so disorganized. The mind maps people are making are a start, but with all of the connections we have... it's just not going to be good enough.</p>
<p>I've never built a wiki before and I don't have a good idea of how they work yet, or if it would be a good option for us. Would we be able to restrict everyone except verified and trusted CJs to modify the wiki? What are the potential drawbacks and consequences of building a wiki for this purpose?  If not a wiki, what platform can we use to beautifully display all of the confirmed information we have? Is there a better option? </p>
<p>I'm willing and ready to put the work in on this right now, but I want us to come to a general consensus on the plan before proceeding.</p></p>

        <p><p>The reddit wiki system probably isn't the best system for all of this information. You really need a full on MediaWiki server running to adequately compile all of the information.</p>
<p>I've been researching our options for this and haven't found anything satisfactory that is either free or affordable.</p>
<p>If anyone has any ideas, I'd like to hear them as I think this is an excellent idea.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is why I created the collaboration post. Self hosting would be best but no one seems interested in donating (you can check the bitcoin address and see nothing has been donated) </p>
<p>If there is a free option, that might be cool. I haven't looked into it yet</p></p>

        <p><p>Knowledgable editors are always welcome to contribute to Wikispooks. Just remember that the primary function of a wiki is NOT discussion/hangout or 'breaking news' focussed, rather it is to carefully organise and reference information - and on the Wikispooks wiki, supressed and hidden information that the MSM shy away from. It is also not for people wishing to campaign or make a name for themselves.</p>
<p>Information on the primary focus of this subreddit would certainly be welcome and 'The pedophocracy' page or a sub-page of it is probably the right place to start.</p>

        <p><p>This one is also very informative.  </p>
<p>https://isgp-studies.com/scare</p>
<p>"One thing we can say with absolute certainty is that in high society internationally there is an incredible amount of disinterest in accusations of child abuse against peers. </p>
<p>No matter what the accusations, whether it's fondling a boy or sadistic rape and torture, the career of a superclass VIP never really seems to suffer. </p>
<p>They usually walk away with friends and colleagues in government and big business staunchly denouncing the accusations as "preposterous" or "outrageous" without demanding any kind of serious investigation. It's really quite bizarre. "</p></p>

        <p><p>With a little effort, anything is possible :)  I know it is a ton of information to process. I figured we could start with the evidence that's been presented in the mind-maps first, and then fill in the blanks from there.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yea, I know about the repo. It is very useful but it's still not quite the same as having a wiki-like page. For instance, if you click on the who.is folder on Git, it's a ton of files that one would have to open each and try to figure out what everything means. We need to be able to display the info faster and more beautifully. Most people aren't going to want to dig through every single file on a Git repository, but if it's in a format where they can simply read through quickly it can help in a lot of ways that the Git doesn't.</p></p>
