        <strong>Alan Dershowitz: Constitutional Law Professor, Clinton/Epstein/St. James Isl. connections and allegations of sex with a child re: "Lolita Express"</strong>
        <p><p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Dershowitz</p>
<p>Haven't seen his name referred to outside of the allegation he engaged in sexual relations with a child.</p>
<p>As a Constitutional Law Professor, it seems his expertise and connections to the Judiciary would be of <em>tremendous</em> benefit to "smothering" investigations/prosecution of ranking pols/LEO/CEO etc. </p>
<p>Can someone bring him into the research? Look at connections to known or suspected pedophiles, legislation or prosecutorial actions that seek to obstruct or otherwise neutralize exposure... </p></p>

        <p><p>I think he was one of the attorneys who gave Immunity for Epstein and all of his pedophile friends. Coulter had a good segment about it on Hannity https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vzVHDU6PBs. </p>
<p>What's crazy is Epstein was allowed to go home 16 hours a day during his 13 month sentence. So he was literally allowed to keep molesting people while in jail. He even had a private jail wing all to himself. Lol thinking about it now, he probably never even had to step foot in the jail cell, that's kind of how these people operate, they've been getting away with everything for fucking way too long.</p></p>

        <p><p>read a book called Rulers of Evil - author suggested their work was necessary - along the lines of <em>who better to rule over sinners than Sinners?</em> Not sure I agree but it's thought provoking. </p>
<p>They've just gone too far...</p></p>

        <p><p>Also one of OJ Simpson's lawyers during the famous trial. Along with Robert Kardashian, Johnny Cochran, and F. Lee Bailey(who famously represented Albert DeSalvo, who was convicted of being the Boston Strangler despite many problems with the case).</p></p>

        <p><p>Good link. My guess is he is a 'Saul Goodman' type. This seems like a critical link.</p></p>
