<p><p>The question is... Why are these on the WL server. Was assange digging into the PizzaGate case at some point?</p></p>

<p><p>That is a legitimate question. I was wondering why these files would be on WL also. BTW, does Maddie McCann have any relation to the McCann Worldgroup? I'm pretty sure they do business with the Clinton Foundation. Perhaps there is a connection there somewhere which would explain why WL has files about her. My google-fu is not what it used to be and finding any significant information is beyond me.</p></p>

<p><p>Wikileaks was also the source of the fbi pedo symbols document that has been floating around the internet for like 8 years.</p>
<p>As this whole thing unfolds, I'm realizing these sick bastards might be the real targets.  Like Assange's real targets.</p></p>

<p><p>3rd is summary which also implies the same. What does it really matter if her parents were involved or not? That IMO is a seperate investigation that Portugal needs to figure out. I want to know where did she go whether alive or dead, and why do the composite sketches match up to John and Tony Podesta? </p></p>

<p><p>The problem is the Portuguese Police have a history of pedophilia and corruption themselves:</p>

<p><p>From your link:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paulo Rebelo, an urbane, methodical detective who led the Casa Pia paedophile inquiry, was last night finishing his first week as the new chief of the investigation into the disappearance of the British child.</p>
<p>Rebelo has replaced Goncalo Amaral, the "oafish" local police chief out of his depth in a case that has captured unprecedented world attention, with millions fascinated by the story of the girl snatched from her bed on holiday while her parents ate with friends 200 yards away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just want to point out that the Dailymail describe Gonçalo Amaral as some local police officer, when the truth is his credentials and curriculum are just as good as Paulo Rebelo's. He was ranked higher in the police hierarchy than Paulo Rebelo, actually. Paulo Rebelo took Amaral's position in a rushed promotion that was unprecedented in Portuguese authorities.</p>
<p>Paulo Rebelo was the main investigator behind many polemic cases in Portugal involving the country's "elite" (politicians, celebrities, businessmen, etc.), fraud, pedophilia, State corruption, etc., that have led to minimal charges (or none) systematically. Some of his investigations have been halted due to illegal judicial procedures from his teams, which means the courts immediately drop the cases in Portugal. When the procedures start over it's a big waste of time and the crimes prescribe, ai. the criminals can't be convicted anymore. This is the easiest method cops use to let friends scot-free in Portugal.</p>
<p>Casa Pia, the biggest orphanage network in Portugal,  had a pedophile ring involving dozens of people from Portugal's "elite" that was made public in the early in the early 2000's (years before Maddie disappeared). Paulo Rebelo lead the investigation for almost a decade but only 1 pedophile plus 2 of the ring organizers were convicted, even though dozens of pedos and ring organizers were referenced in detail by the abused children in official testimonies. </p>
<p>With the help of UK influence, the McCanns had Gonçalo Amaral removed from the investigation soon after he made them as part of the official suspects of their daughter's disappearance. the McCanns flew to the UK 2 days after they were made official suspects. 3 weeks later, Amaral was discharged from the force. Paulo Rebelo took over and led the investigation in other directions with no results (as usual). Less than 1 year later (in mid 2008), UK authorities took over, and the McCanns were never questioned again.</p></p>

<p><p>That's some interesting info. Sounds alot like what's going on with Arun Rao in the US. Would you happen to know if the McCanns are aware of the possible Podesta involvement?</p></p>

<p><p>I did a search as best as I could for conventions in Portugal at the time. There was one for hedge funds but I couldn't track it any further because they didn't have any files or attendees listed. There were a few others but they had files and video and I didn't see anything innocuous. Maybe a fresh set of eyes on it. </p></p>

<p><p>The document has already been translated for a long time. Google mccannpjfiles and look for the translations section on that website. You'll find the document and most of the documents pertaining to the Portuguese investigation. </p></p>

<p><p>Wow...ok...so just found here that Elizabeth Bagley was US Ambassador to Portugal under Bill Clinton and also
Bagley is a member of the Board of Directors of the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (ICMEC), a global nonprofit organization that combats child sexual exploitation, child pornography, and child abduction.</p>
