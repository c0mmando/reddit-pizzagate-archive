   <strong>
    Arrest Jack Dorsey for allowing the distribution of CP on Twitter!
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Hundreds... no, thousands of Twitter accounts are being found with CP! Indict every single one of those motherfuckers who own these accounts displaying CP. Arrest and indict Jack Dorsey for distributing CP on his website.
    <strong>
     Justice needs to be served. This can NOT go unpunished.
    </strong>
    Get this to r/all
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Several Twitter users are tagging those with pedo accounts on the website. Tons and tons of accounts hosting, sharing, liking, and retweeting CP. So #Pizzagate is censored on Twitter, but hardcore CP isn't??? What a fucking awful world we live in.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    By the way... Jack Dorsey is on the Board of Directors for Disney.

     That's a great hope and all, but how is anyone going to know if its being suppressed on Twitter and MSM? Hope foreign rags pick it up?

    Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me....
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now, I see.
   </p>
   <p>
    T'was Grace that taught...
my heart to fear.
And Grace, my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear...
the hour I first believed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Through many dangers, toils and snares...
we have already come.
T'was Grace that brought us safe thus far...
and Grace will lead us home.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Lord has promised good to me...
His word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be...
as long as life endures.
   </p>
   <p>
    When we've been here ten thousand years...
bright shining as the sun.
We've no less days to sing God's praise...
then when we've first begun.
   </p>
   <p>
    Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me....
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now, I see.

       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        17 And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:
       </p>
       <p>
        2 With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.
       </p>
       <p>
        3 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
       </p>
       <p>
        4 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:
       </p>
       <p>
        5 And upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery, Babylon The Great, The Mother Of Harlots And Abominations Of The Earth.
       </p>
       <p>
        6 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.
       </p>
       <p>
        7 And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.
       </p>
       <p>
        8 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.
       </p>
       <p>
        9 And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.
       </p>
       <p>
        10 And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.
       </p>
       <p>
        11 And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.
       </p>
       <p>
        12 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.
       </p>
       <p>
        13 These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.
       </p>
       <p>
        14 These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.
       </p>
       <p>
        15 And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
       </p>
       <p>
        16 And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.
       </p>
       <p>
        17 For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.
       </p>
       <p>
        18 And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.
       </p>
       <p>
        18 And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.
       </p>
       <p>
        2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.
       </p>
       <p>
        3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.
       </p>
       <p>
        4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.
       </p>
       <p>
        5 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.
       </p>
       <p>
        6 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.
       </p>
       <p>
        7 How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.
       </p>
       <p>
        8 Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.
       </p>
       <p>
        9 And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,
       </p>
       <p>
        10 Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.
       </p>
       <p>
        11 And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:
       </p>
       <p>
        12 The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,
       </p>
       <p>
        13 And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.
       </p>
       <p>
        14 And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.
       </p>
       <p>
        15 The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,
       </p>
       <p>
        16 And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!
       </p>
       <p>
        17 For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,
       </p>
       <p>
        18 And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!
       </p>
       <p>
        19 And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.
       </p>
       <p>
        20 Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.
       </p>
       <p>
        21 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.
       </p>
       <p>
        22 And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;
       </p>
       <p>
        23 And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
       </p>
       <p>
        24 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.
King James Version (KJV)

       Several others and myself have come to the conclusion that reporting any of this to twitter is completely useless. It's much better to directly report this to the fbi before twitter just scrubs it off for the world to forget. Do remember that these are the people who banned @0hour &amp; several people who made any mention of #pizzagate and took much longer to take action towards the actual CP being posted

    how is he related to clintons? I think I remember him being related to Hillary &amp; her campaign somehow - that would link this to pizzagate potentially
   </p>
   <p>
    &amp; explain why he was censoring us so badly for speaking out on it. UGH

      For sure they are in on it.  It's important to start widening our view of things now.  These corporations don't just rise to the top on accident.  It's not just a "good idea and work hard" that makes you Google and FB and Twitter.  Hell, look at Enron.  Was full of pedos.  George Bush helped get that company off the ground.  Then they bankrupted the public, were exposed as pedos, and it all more or less got swept under the rug.  Citizens are close to finding out their world is fake - edit - not to go political, as everyone may be implicated - but why do you think Bush backed Hillary?  Same crime ring.

       If I were a CIA scumbag, back in the 90's I would have said to my colleagues "hey, we should get into all this private equity and tech investing stuff.  Seems to be the wave of the future and could really help us shape the future and pick the winners"  I would be very surprised if they didn't do that.

       Naturally these creeps would also have their assets all over the boards of directors of key companies.

        Watch the documentary "The smartest guys in the room".  George Bush was bff with these people.  A lot involved Dyncorp as well.  The dude that killed himself from Enron was concerned that he was labeled as a pedo.  Dyncorp ended up being caught red handed with involvement to child trafficking.  It was swept under the rug.  George Bush is a big time player in this pedo ring.

        "After DynCorp personnel were later the subject of several lawsuits related to pedophilia and sex slave trafficking in partnership with local mafia in Eastern Europe,[76] Armitage as a senior official at the U.S. State Department would write a letter in support of large new sole source contracts to DynCorp based on the theory that a company should not lose contracts as a result of the conduct of a few employees. In short, sex slave trafficking and pedophilia in its ranks did not prevent DynCorp from winning significant new contracts, including a $500 million sole-source contract to run police, enforcement, courts and prisons in Iraq."

    Do not post direct links to the twitter accounts.  It is a violation of Reddit's TOS, and will be the end of this sub.  Feel free to discuss!  This is obviously an important tangentially related development.

     So does this mean that any way to find evidence of this is in fact illegal as well? What a perfect crime if that is the case!

    If it should be discovered that Dorsey
    <em>
     knowingly and willfully
    </em>
    perpetuated this, then he should absolutely be arrested.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, we should not be rallying for neutral hosters of information to be blamed for the information shared on said sites. Otherwise, we'd be arresting email founders for its users sending criminal emails, or fileshare companies for housing pirated stuff uploaded by users. This would be absolutely terrible for freedom of speech--the genuine, good kind like we're promoting here.
   </p>
   <p>
    So let us be very, VERY careful about what we wish for.

     In this case, though, it simply isn't plausible that it would have gone undetected for so long. The higher-ups are clearly implicated in some or other way.

     They have arrested the CEO for pimping minors last month. So going after the sites will become a thing if he is found guilty.

    No. There's a reason social media sites aren't held accountable for the actions of their users, and it needs to stay that way.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now, if (probably when) it comes out Dorsey was actively covering up for pedos (or delegating such activities), THEN throw him in prison, where the inmates like to make pedos their bitch (if they don't shank/dismember them first).

     I searched Eclipse_ow on twitter. Even tho acct is banned, some pics came up. Whoever posted them took to them with a black paintbrush to hide the naughty bits. Still sickening though. Shit is real --- yes, you bet your ass it is, and many times come from the people you would least suspect.

    Then you should arrest the admins of reddit too. Is that what you want? Someone can post shit to your site and you get arrested?
    <br/>
    The admins of the site you use and love so much only removed jailbait after it was on CNN. But i don't see you running around wanting the admins to be arrested?

     First of all - any instances I've seen where stuff like this has been posted on reddit has been immediately removed by reddit mods. Example: the incident that happened yesterday with the 2GB dudes. Reddit appears to be actively managing the situation. Twitter, however, is not. Instead of immediately banning the accounts with CP, they banned the ones revealing it! Some of these accounts are said to have been around for even a year. The big difference is whether the site is actively managing the issue or not, which clearly Jack Dorsey is not. If they arrested the owner of Backpages due to prostitution allegations, they certainly need to arrest Jack Dorsey for child porn. It is A LOT fucking worse.

    This is how they control and blacken the souls of our politicians so that they fall in line and are so willing to do wicked things to us, not just in this country but you see the trail of destruction these sick fucks leave in countries like Haiti, Honduras, Venezuela and Brazil with their fucked up policies that only serve to cripple the populations of these countries. These people are fucking sick and need to be disposed from their positions, publicly humiliated and discredited and locked up for the rest of their miserable fucking lives. This is not something we should be taking lightly as a society. Squad up, network and wage war on these sub-human scum. Do it for your country, and the lives of these children. Do it for us, so we can wipe the stain of these atrocities off our souls. They are fucking ruining us every minute we let this go on.

    they are slowly trying to make the masses accept cheese pizza accross the board. Its a long term well thought out agenda. Look at this coming from the UK press. Home Office 'gave Paedophile Information Exchange £70,000': Group allegedly given taxpayers' money between 1977 and 1980.. We must root out these fucking deamons, getting tax payers to pay to promote thier perverted views and nothing has changed to this day. "Dolphin Square, Savile, links to royalty,common purpose,social services,secret courts and child snatching from the state, using boy homes as pick and mix brothles, serving MI5 agentsand beyond, let alone the filming, entrapment and blackmail.THEY (pedos/satanic scum elite) HAVE INFILTRATED EVERYWHERE  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2571632/Home-Office-gave-Paedophile-Information-Exchange-70-000-Group-allegedly-given-taxpayers-money-1977-1980.html

    This is bizarre. How can this have happened without it being detected and stopped? With all the analytical tools these large internet corporations have, why didn't this raise even one red flag?

    I don't mean to be a downer here, but prosecuting Jack Dorsey will be impossible unless he himself is distributing CP from an account linked directly to him.  ToS for most social media sites explicitly prohibit the posting of CP.  So unless you can prove he is personally distributing CP or officially granting CP to be posted to his site, he has a legal umbrella from which to operate.

    Great idea but if they ain't gonna close down 20,000 sick fucks and close down the people doing great, unsung work exposing it, do you think they're gonna arrest and indict him?
