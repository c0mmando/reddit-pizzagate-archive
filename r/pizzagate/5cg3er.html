     100% good Idea. Whatever this is, real or not, questions need to be answered for the people.

     Maybe if you could plant them places they would be noticed like in public restrooms or the like?
    </p>
    <p>
     Try and get the word spreading. If it's all just a crock of shit and everyone has read too much into things, well happy days tbh. But it deserves to be explored. The further down the rabbit hole I get, the scarier shit becomes.

      Do not use a printer if it is linked to you via credit card or IP address.  Almost all new printers have Steganography and use little yellow dots to tie it back to the printer.  That way law enforcement can trace it back to you.

     I love #1 because it's one of those little things that's whack enough that it really gives people a "Woah!" moment while still giving them an out "muh money laundering".  But if you were right about that one, what else might you be right about...?

     Can you provide proof of this? I would assume that printers such as the ones found in Kinkos would implement this, and I just happened to print something from there. It would be nice to see if the printer, added additional "information" to my tax return.

       Yeah, I got a blue light. Unfortunately the ones in Kinkos either do not implement this, or they are using a proprietary technology to is yet to be discovered by researchers.

     probably best to avoid areas that have CCTV altogether. Maybe use gloves when handling things you're leaving anywhere also..

     Go old school. Cut letters out of a magazine and paste them on a blank piece of paper. Then make copies on a Xerox machine at a local church or something.

    Personally I don't think so. You may inadvertently expose people to CP type material (some people can't even read about it) but depends on what you want to achieve. If out of 100 people, 10 people responded and 5 took up like we are, is it worth the effort?

    Don't bother.  Just dig for info, connect the dots.

     Just curious, how do you think we will be able to inform the public? By that I mean how will we relay this on a large scale without it somehow getting covered up

      It's not on you to inform the public.  I would just learn as much as possible right now.  When it is time to inform the public, you are a beacon.
     </p>
     <p>
      It's incredible difficult to believe, digest, and just boggles the mind.  Nobody will believe you unless there's a broader announcement, like from the uncucked parts of the FBI or something.  Probably after Trump is inaugurated.
     </p>
     <p>
      It's also risky to broadcast this stuff because these people are
      <em>
       extremely dangerous
      </em>
      .

      typically, those who would look it up, already are, and those who wouldn't, would think to themselves when it's brought up to the light 'this is just a lame conspiracy theory'

    No. The people who are good at sifting through bullshit and shills are already longtime 4chan and 8chan and irc users. They already know. The next phase (coming soon) is when we want to post on mumsnet and leave notes around the neighborhood. That time will come soon.

    No. There are pedo scandals that have a LOT more evidence.  Both online and in books.  If you did the same thing for, say, the Franklin Scandal, and the Finders and Dutroux scandals, that would be an excellent idea.
   </p>
   <p>
    What we really need to do is implement a 'marketing' campaign for lack of a better phrase.  There are sites that have excellent info in them about ALL the pedo/sra scandals.  We should promote these sites in tweets to journalists and congressmen, and also to specific groups, as someone mentioned in another thread: religious groups and churches are an excellent place to get people to discuss these crimes.  Also colleges.  The point is we need a focused campaign complete with a website as a focal point in order to educate people about what is going on.
