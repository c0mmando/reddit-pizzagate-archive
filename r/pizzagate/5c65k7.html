    Have a listen to his last interview with a Polish interviewer. He talks about paedophiles and underground tunnels connected to churches and nurseries.
   </p>
   <p>
    Around 24:20 it starts to get weird, spiers becomes incoherent and complains that he cannot feel his throat. 
It sounds ridiculous to think that these satanists would summon entities to 'silence' people who speak out against their sick ways but I literally don't know what to believe in nowadays.

    One of the long ball goals (((they))) want to carry out is DNA genocide &amp; that's why you see so many adds for Ancestry DNA, 23&amp;me etc.

      Yeah, just pointing out what other people may have already read. I don't really see any ethical merit in questioning the sanity of people who simply look into things that seem suspicious. If nobody ever bothers, then nobody ever gets rescued, either. I'd rather many investigations turning out to be nothing, than there being no investigations at all. That people care enough to pay attention and look into something is what it is important. People who would mock those who look into something, well they are the same sort of people who would turn a blind eye to child abuse if it were right in front of them. I have known such people. Their opinion is not worth respecting in the least.

        The only stuff that I saw (from people looking into things) that I completely disapprove of were the people who actually went to the suspected's social media and started calling them pedophiles and such. It is an extremely severe accusation to make, and to make it where their friends/family might see it, without proof, no excuse for that crap. But those who have kept a respectful distance while looking into things restore a little of my faith in humanity.

         I honestly think a significant portion of those people publicly attacking are part of an organized effort (I.e. CTR) to discredit the research movement and make researchers look like crazy conspiracy theorists (I'm using it intentionally derogatorily because that's how it is used)
        </p>
        <p>
         Dis-info is very powerful when directed at those who already don't want to believe a horrific truth.

    Keep talking.  Be careful about anything digitally traceable, and make sure you either stab the microphone on your phone, or keep it away from you when you're talking but this shit is real and you need to tell everyone you can.

    Yes, while I also think there is nefarious stuff going on
    <em>
     specifically
    </em>
    here, if you have researched the history of this evil crap, you know they are
    <em>
     experts
    </em>
    and disinfo and disassociation and distraction.
   </p>
   <p>
    And that includes doing things like putting out false info so when people accuse this person, they can turn and say, 'see?  it's all bullshit and people maliciously and falsely accusing these innocent people'.  They've already done this at least TWICE.
   </p>
   <p>
    So, investigate?  Absolutely.  Accuse or contact in ANY WAY?  You're a complete idiot, because not only do you potentially accuse an innocent person, you also DESTROY an investigation at the same time.  Which would make you a compete idiot!  And hence and abettor of child molestation.  Keep your mouths shut please.
