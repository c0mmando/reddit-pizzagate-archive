        <strong>Is this one of the darkest things in modern history with satanic ties or am I going nuts from looking into this too much?</strong>
        <p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BplUD6kQYuU Basically this shit has been going on for so long and <a href="http://illuminatisymbols.info/wp-content/uploads/Illuminati-symbols-Streets-of-Washington-DC-Pentagram-no-overlays.jpg">Washington DC</a> is full of free mason symbols. That artist Kim Noble <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/5671749755_64ff389f0f.jpg">("hotdog" warning)</a> Podesta likes was a victim of mind control. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72OznY9ByZo">Another</a> mind control victim from the occult. The way they get the control of these people is through extreme brutal childhood trauma (stories have been told about witnessing unborn fetuses ripped out infront of them) that splits personalities.There's literally a <a href="http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/112178416.jpg">giant pagan temple</a> with what looks to be a huge underground complex that was owned by a convicted pedophile the Clintons have been to multiple times. Is pedophilia really a privlege among the elite? Kubrick had a lot of big Hollywood ties to Warner who also use one of those <a href="https://consumermediallc.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/timewarnercablevan.jpg">pedo logos</a> on their stuff. Was he really trying to expose it in his film Eyes Wide Shut but died before the film was released?</p></p>

        <p><p>Can't stress this enough. Take a break. I was helping spread this when the story was being pieced together and started breaking late last week, over the weekend I said to myself "fuck it. No more conspiracy stuff for a few days. This shit got real dark, real scary, real quick." I've just come back today, and I'm so happy to see how wide an audience this has already reached! And it has its own subreddit! Great work to everyone who is spreading this ad much as you can. Visibility and exposure are key to this. But if you start getting anxious, worried, or scared for your own mental health - take a break. Go do something you enjoy for a few days. The movement is still moving. This is a group effort. </p></p>

        <p><p>Same here, I'm fearless but I needed a break. I was developing too much of a sense of urgency and I wasn't sleeping. We can do this if we have each other to lean on.</p>
<p>Unlike the kids living this fucking nightmare as we speak.</p></p>

        <p><p>Same here. Had to take a break. Was spooked by every noise in my home. Haven't slept for a couple of days. Keep imagining what these children are going through. Just being cut apart and tortured. It is insane. And friends and family won't believe it. Most of the public is still in a trance. </p>
<p>But one by one, they look at the evidence and start seeing it. So it is working. </p>
<p>I do believe we must be fearless and proceed ahead together. We need to make all of this super viral, 24/7, because it cannot be debunked. It is real. And that means kids could be trapped as we speak. Eventually, if we are loud enough, there will be an awakening, possibly the largest in human history. </p>
<p>Keep going. We can exorcise this darkness.</p>
<p>And if you are not a theist, now might be a time to reconsider, and begin praying to whatever God there is for help. I know I have been. </p></p>

        <p><p>I'm not a theist in the traditional sense. I believe in "God" as Buddhists relate the word to mean "the universe", but that being said I also believe we're all here and brought together for the same purpose. Call it fate, synchronicity, God, whatever you want, but fuck me if this isn't significant. </p></p>

        <p><p>Nice! I got into reading about Buddhism about a year ago, the eightfold path to end suffering, and about siddhartha gautama and his life and it all just seemed to resonate really well with my core beliefs add a person. Helped me on my way to veganism and the truth movement; I want to study it more as well as Hinduism which I hear it's quite similar in philosophies.<br>
By the way, is my understanding of theist wrong? I thought theist meant you believe in a "God" as in the traditional sense of a sentient creator, but I don't believe in that, and as far as I'm aware that isn't really what Buddhism is about. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, you are correct about that being theism. 😊 My own core belief is that there is a higher power beyond my own highest power. I'm not sure what purpose it serves, but it seems to care about me and other people very much. I read a theory once that said that what we perceive to be God is actually our highest self, the part of us that exists outside of time and knows why we chose this particular life, and will help us navigate it through mistakes or hardship. So since I kind of equate that with God in a slightly more traditional sense, I think of myself as a theist. But I have absolutely no problem with other beliefs so long as they stick to kindness, compassion, and responsibility for our own actions, that kind of thing. I hope that makes sense!</p></p>

        <p><p>I really like that! Yeah it totally makes sense. The "higher self" rings a bell to me, I think I must've read something about that once since it seems familiar. In a way it actually reminds me of scientology, since I was reading about that only last week and it sounds similar to what they call the "thetan self" I think. The thetan self is like our ultimate consciousness and goes about the universe inhabiting these physical bodies throughout time and space, forgetting what it actually is. But what I believe is that consciousness does transcend what we know as life, I totally believe death isn't the end and is simply just a transitional phase to what reality consciousness exists in when not in a physical body. I like this because it's kinda liberating. Takes a bit of weight off your shoulders to think that this isn't everything. This is just a little bit of what's really out there, so just enjoy and do the best you can while you're here :)</p></p>

        <p><p>That's what kills me. Half the people I know won't believe this stuff. Too much cognitive dissonance. All I can think about is what all those kids are going through right now, and it keeps me awake. Ultimately, I don't care what this does to society, or the economy, this has to end. We have to end it. </p></p>

        <p><p>The ones who refuse to believe it the most are people who were child victims who are in deep denial of what happened to them. Beware of triggering  them. You don't want to go there. It is better to just leave them alone. </p></p>

        <p><p>The media are corrupt.  They won't print or broadcast this because it implicates so much of the government.  Small-time newspapers won't pick it up because mainstream won't run it (thus making it a "conspiracy theory").  A D.C. newspaper did mention it, but they just basically called it a crazy conspiracy theory, and got Alefantis to comment on it.</p></p>

        <p><p>If it's not real, it wouldn't continue to unravel like this. I wonder how many people know about it, which people, how long they've all been keeping each other quiet. It reminds me of the story "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas" by Ursula K. LeGuin. </p>
<p>"They all know it is there, all the people of Omelas. Some of them have come to see it, others are content merely to know it is there. They all know that it has to be there. Some of them understand why, and some do not, but they all understand that their happiness, the beauty of their city, the tenderness of their friendships, the health of their children, the wisdom of their scholars, the skill of their makers, even the abundance of their harvest and the kindly weathers of their skies, depend wholly on this child's abominable misery."</p></p>

        <p><p>Agreed. When going down a rabbit hole, if you are being sensible and objective and there's no validity to the subject of your research, it will dead end or debunk itself.</p>
<p>Everything I have checked on this pedo stuff has lead to another connection. Even my check of a random name from the "pizza extravaganza" email turned out to be some lady tied to a worldwide childrens talent agency. </p>
<p>This is some sick shit. </p></p>

        <p><p>EWS is filled with background imagery of Xmas... people traditionally assuming this is a literal reference to signify that a lot of the evil in America is based around consumerism.... but Kubrick is more complex than that...</p>
<p>The Xmas imagery signifies that is was HIS GIFT to the world</p>

        <p><p>You know I've heard really good theories that it was a misdirect so he could be "killed" and work on 9/11.  </p>
<p>At the point he made it he already had a cult following of people analyzing his movies insanely.  </p>
<p>A stand out point in the film is when tom cruise character is told to "stop looking for meanings in things."</p>
<p>This always rang out as disinformation to me.  Why would we ever stop looking for truth?  Kubrick is CRM114</p></p>

        <p><p>this is the truth. You are nut going nuts. What you see have is clarity. It is startling, uncomfortable and overwhelming. Yet c'est la vie. At the end of the day you need to take your medicine to heal. Satanism goes back a lot longer than America (New Atlantisdeclared its independence in 1776, the same year of the Bavarian Illuminati was established), Free Masons, or pizza. To think America is beyond the true struggle of good and evil is true hubris. Find strength in knowing he truth sets you free and the strength you have gained to get here is that which makes you strong enough to go on.</p>

        <p><p>To anyone new to this realm of stuff, Gunderson takes a little bit of digging before you see fellow researchers warn against him, but he attaches himself to as many related cases from the time as he could. He dated one of the McMartin Preschool (good place to start for newbies) mom's, and is said to be romantically involved with others related to the case as well. </p>
<p>AND most importantly, I've heard several times that he was in daily contact with Lt. Col. Michael Aquino. Aquino is a Psy-ops general who has been connected with MK Ultra and it's related pedo-rings since running ground operations of Psy-ops in Vietnam. </p>
<p>I'm certainly not saying to stop looking at Gunderson, but make sure you look closely and critically. </p>
<p>EDIT: As for the Kubrick stuff, it's clearly laden with occult symbolism from the very first Star of Ishtar that you see. I am a former film major, and at least to me, the very well-laid symbolism does a great job at hinting at MK Ultra and Pedophilia being at the background of everything. If you freeze frame on mostly unimportant stuff, like the other articles on the newspaper that Bill looks at, you can tell Kubrick was learned in the darker part of Hollywood that plug right into MK Ultra.</p></p>

        <p><p>We create a smokescreen. Basically, we post these photos and articles and links every so often on Twitter and get hashtags trending. If we make enough noise, and keep making more and more noise, two things happen: a) we raise a ton of awareness, and b) make it a lot easier for field agents to maneuver and root this shit out without getting killed or worse.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is so sad. I have learnt a lot from this election. I wasn't even into politics until I randomly watched the first debate.. I'm not even American. Once I found out about Wikileaks I was hooked. And then it just got so much worse.</p>
<p>I got hooked on true crime books last year, and the one recurring thing that gets me every book is when detectives do a bad job and fuck up a case/don't pursue justice/try to frame the wrong person, and then someone else has to go above and beyond to make things right.</p>
<p>This new information on pedophile rings/satanic history/elite people I haven't heard of, is going to consume a lot of my time! There is so much I don't know. I hate this feeling of not being able to fix something that is so inherently bad/broken, which is why I never wanted to get into politics in the first place, lol. </p></p>
