        <strong>Bizarre Chinese Powerpoints on Wikileaks possibly containing hidden content. Possible embedded materials?</strong>
        <p><p>https://search.wikileaks.org/?q=johnson_lo%40mail2000.com.tw</p>
<p>I think we need to take a look at this now. These strange Chinese emails with PowerPoint files that have NOTHING to do with the DNC or politics are very out of place here. Some are flowers. Some are paintings. Someone on reddit said that there was one with kids but I haven't look through all of them yet. My Chinese friend says that last slide of the flowers one tells a story about Wu Ze Tian, the first female emperor. There's another that's called "It Takes Two to Tango" and it's just loads of birds in pairs. pic related. They're all just weird generic slideshows and this is what concerns me. We've seen that some images have embedded materials in them, so I think we should check this Chinese PowerPoint guy out. It seems this guy is associated with some insurance company though. Google Translate in one of his regular emails lead me to the website for Cathay Life Insurance but it won't let me post the link here. Just google it and click the first link or whatever.</p></p>
