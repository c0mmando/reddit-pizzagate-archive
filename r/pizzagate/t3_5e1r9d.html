<strong>After our latest 'honey pot,' can a cyber security pro give us a run-down on the possible legal ramifications of digging around? Questions inside.</strong>
<p><p>Should we be using a computer or mobile [redditisfun] for digging around?</p>
<p>Is it recommended to use a VPN?</p>
<p>I've taped up my PC camera. Should my mobile be covered, too?</p>
<p>Should we purge personal information on our terminals for safety? Social media, photos, etc.</p>
<p>Does possessing copies, screenshots, etc. put us in legal danger? Should they be removed from devices and left in drop boxes?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help. I am just a concerned citizen trying to help.</p></p>

<p><p>If you download child porn onto your computer, that is a CRIME.   </p>
<p>It can be retrieved by authorities using special software as well.</p>
<p>They (authorities) have also created websites with child porn on it and it contains viruses that'll send your name/address to authorities.</p>
<p>So, yes, don't click on blind links or download anything that you think crosses a line.</p></p>

<p><p>Of course. The only information I've saved are screen shots of screen shots and some of the information maps for quick reference.</p>
<p>My next question is, could those image files contain malware that could infect a computer or mobile?</p></p>

<p><p>I posted elsewhere: </p>
<p>If you need to remain anonymous, then you need to not: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use the same computer you always use. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the same internet connection. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the same browser, with the same cookies, tracking, and other fingerprints. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>TOR is owned top-to-bottom, left-to-right but is probably worth using. </p>
<p>People who are serious about anonymity don't make the same mistakes DPR made. They don't use the same connections and they don't use a computer purchased digitally which can be tracked; at the very least, they buy computers in cash, anonymously. At the very least you should use a VM with a USB wireless card (which has a NEW MAC) and on a new connection unrelated to you if you want to get into the nitty gritty; however, that's dangerous and you might stumble upon CP or worse if you dig too deep in the wrong areas. I'm more inclined to let other people dig and then, myself, verify. I do not want to get popped for anything.  </p>
<p>I'm willing to bet the majority of people here have little-to-no background in Cyber Security and need to be far more careful in their actions. </p>
<p>Recall that anonymous got people in legal trouble with LOIC. Not trying to scare people but just be aware of what you're doing, everyone needs to be informed about their actions and what they might do. </p>
<p>Click the wrong link, you've accidentally downloaded CP; open the wrong PDF, owned; browse the wrong website, get drive-by or watering hole popped; have JavaScript enabled, instant malware install - this happened during TORpedo aka tor pedo - hunting pedos on TOR. </p>
<p>Dig, research, but KNOW how to partially obfuscate your actions if need be. Please do research before acting. </p>
<p>Don't DOX, beware of accidentally participating in raids or attacks as you can be tracked and punished. </p>
<p>Be smart; analyze everything - slowly &amp; methodically. </p></p>

<p><p>My dox was a factory reset on mobile. Is that excessive? </p></p>

<p><p>You said don't 'DOX.' I am not computer literate. Is a DOX on mobile just simply factory resetting?</p></p>

<p><p>mh im no expert, but what i have seen here is for e.g. that someone says he saw something suspicious on a twitter account which was new, and clicking onto this link led to cp. Maybe he was just a bit careless or just ctr trying to lure us into illegal stuff. be careful</p></p>

<p><p>Either way. I think this is a good opportunity for us to take a step back and remember that if indeed there is such an evil force, then that's the one were up against.</p></p>

<p><p>I quote you the right column of the sub:
"ATTENTION: Make sure you protect your anonymity. This is not a joke. For at least 30 years if not longer the things we are researching have perpetually been covered up by all of the most powerful people and organizations all over the world and has lead to people disappearing! | I highly recommend using Tor and a VPN, a reddit throwaway account is not a bad idea either!"</p></p>

<p><p>If it truly is, then its a stupid honeypot. They would have kept the link up longer and tried to leak it under less suspicious circumstances. Hardly anyone will go near that shit with a 10 foot pole. Honeypotting with an entire description that what they will be downloading is legit CP and from such a seemingly unexperienced source... Yeah i'm not buying the honeypot sliding threads.</p></p>

<p><p>Spin up virtual machines, use proxies, set up some sort of a vpn probably. The important thing is to not save anything directly on a local drive. If you find documents, only download them in a virtual machine so you can hopefully encrypt the virtual hard disk file.</p>
<p>You absolutely have to understand legal ramifications. Arguing white hate hacking from this point of view could be incredibly difficult. If you get yourself in the wrong position, you could be facing serious criminal charges.</p></p>

<p><p>I am not an expert, but I will comment on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does possessing copies, screenshots, etc. put us in legal danger?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Possession of child pornography is a crime.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is a crime that is favored for taking down people who are doing things that more powerful people do not want done.</p>
<p>Digging into CP is a massively risky game.</p></p>

<p><p>I'd say "this is the US Govt, the people capable of Stuxnet." Beware leading people into other conspiracies when they are unrelated. You don't want to turn people off who may otherwise be sympathetic to the "cause."</p></p>
