   <strong>
    Announcement: Flying to DC for 2 Week Private Investigation into PizzaGate.
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Hey Guys, I will be flying out to DC this Wednesday 11/16/16 to investigate some of the claims posted here for 2 weeks. I have 2 friends that Live in Boston who will be joining me on this trip.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are a few leads of my own that I feel can guarentee me some great intel.
   </p>
   <p>
    I want to be transparent with each and every one of you.
   </p>
   <p>
    I was able to Geo-Locate some gay dating apps in the recent days to mark my location as if I was currently in DC. Most of the individuals related to the accusations tend to be Gay/Drag crowd. I have garnered quite a few messages from individuals who want to hook-up. I will use my looks to get me past the traditional hang-outs and more into the "Hidden After Parties"  most of which are UnderGround.
   </p>
   <p>
    [I will NOT be having SEX with anyone]
   </p>
   <p>
    I want you guys to know: This is a different route for information seeking, I get it. I am here to look for answers in the unsuspecting ways.
   </p>
   <p>
    My Opiniated Theory : An underground possibility.

   <p>
    The church has always been suspected of involvement with Pedophilia, Not this church in particular but I am not leaving any stone unturned. There are 8 different "Gay Bath Houses" Hidden and aligned in significance to Conneticut Ave. Only one of those Bath Houses is legally listed. The fact that Tunnels can easily connect these different locations."
   </p>
   <p>
    "The Crew DC Bath House"
   </p>
   <p>
    DC has lots of people that require intense Discretion. Why travel and be seen above when you can be free below?
   </p>
   <p>
    I have been to a few bath houses before and the clientel are most oldermen with money and family men. There are some that come off completely shady which I feel are going to be the ones that are unlisted.
   </p>
   <p>
    I will do what I can to find these tunnels. They exist and I am betting they are connected. Check this tidbit out.

   <p>
    I will also be attending a very exclusive Politcal Fundraiser this Saturday with an older gentleman of Significance in Lobbying area of politics. I am a very attactive guy, these older guys cannot walk away if they think you have any sight of interest in them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Feel free to check out my other posts. I am here to help with a different point of view. Use the info I give you to open your mind and run with the possibilities. After I provided the groups Tumblr page we were able to disect some more info.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you guys can help with some donations that would be epic.

    Also PM with suggestions on some areas of interest. We will be visiting the Office of Public Records to pull documentations of Business and Land Records.
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit: It was my intention to announce my plans. My approach is different than anything you are doing. Chill the fuck out. They are already in the news, Social Media Accounts made private. Unless you know my identity among the millions of tourist/residents/Anyone it is just a regular day.

   </p>
   <p>
    You realize a lot of the perps are watching here right?

    Congrats on just blowing your entire investigation

     I don't like to use ad hominem attacks OP, but..... this was pretty stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even though you likely ruined it, I hope this serves as a lesson to anyone else reading:  If you are going to do something that the receiving party doesn't necessarily like, don't announce your plans that will find its way back to that entity.  Said entity will be aware of a threat, and take measures to mitigate and eliminate all potential damage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Look at the military.  The only warning some of our enemies get of a plan against them is half a second of whooshing air until a missile hits their building.  You're facing prepared adversaries, you should act the same.

      Just so you know, we cannot recommend that people message you or donate to you. There are a lot of shills and trolls on here, how do we know that you're not one of them (or worse)? As it stands, we don't.

    OP I totally understand your not wanting to have sex with men. Having said that you might need to suck a dick or two to really get access. Don't worry, we won't judge. You'll be celebrated as the man who took a bullet to uncover an underground pedophile ring that could take down large portions of the government.

     This is how it should be.  Don't donate to someone cause they say they are going to DC, donate if they provide any evidence.

    Hello:
   </p>
   <p>
    Please ignore the ridiculous posts.  This is something that needs to be done, and I think you are using an excellent angle on this.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you are going down there, could you please purchase a flir mobile phone thermal add-on?  And inspect the inside of Comet Pizza?  Using thermal you should be able to detect any false doors, etc.
   </p>
   <p>
    Also, using thermal may help you in investigating the underground.  Temperature changes in walls tell stories!

    A word of advice: do NOT meet up with anybody claiming to be from this sub in person.  Opsec is vital and right now you're on your own.  There's no way to verify anybody's identity or intentions from this sub so under no circumstances should you make physical contact with anybody offering to help, etc.

    If only 5% of our suspicions are true "they" would rather kill ten remotely suspicious people before letting one have a glance at what they're up to. Your approach sounds sensible, though.

    All jokes aside, watch out for getting drugged if you go into the gay club scene. Not to disparage all gays at clubs, who are predominantly good people who are out to have fun in a friendly environment.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is a seldom talked about issue though, as men tend to feel immune to getting drugged. Watch out for your cornhole.

    In at least one of the emails there's a list of invitees for one of the possible spirit cooking dinners that James Alefantis was involved. 10-3-15
   </p>
   <p>
    There are lawyers, business owners, etc.
   </p>
   <p>
    Maybe select a few that you could stop by their place of business. And ask if they'd been to it. .
   </p>
   <p>
    Observe their reaction.   Listen to their response. Denial?  Surprise?  No big deal?  Willing to describe it in detail?
   </p>
   <p>
    This would reveal if these are just something a tad bizarre but not as bad as it sounds.
   </p>

    To be perfectly honest, it may be a good thing to announce that he is going.  Usually when suspects know that people are after them they get nervous and are much more likely to make a critical mistake.

    Not a good idea dude. These people are billionaires or at the highest levels of government and the intelligence services. They know the email you registered your throwaway with, they now know who you are and you're coming to them.

    You're an idiot for announcing this.
   </p>
   <p>
    You have no idea the kinds of tools they have at their disposal.
   </p>
   <p>
    They've probably already identified you and will track you (at best) the whole time.

    Hi.
   </p>
   <p>
    Honestly the best idea, would be to get a 1 year old baby and put a superficial undetecable chip on him and leave him at some "hot spot" and see if the gets kidnapped.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then you follow the lead.
   </p>
   <p>
    Of course this is not plausible and it's only an idea that occurs to an autist like me, but hey.
