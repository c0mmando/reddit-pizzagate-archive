<strong>Arch-paedophile Jimmy Savile had a reputation for groping teenage girls at his favourite restaurant, Flying Pizza, where he spent much of his time socialising</strong>
<p><p>Pizza clearly had a different connotation for him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sickening pictures show arch-paedophile Savile rubbing himself on the teen and touching her bottom in front of her mother, who he is believed to have known, at the Flying Pizza restaurant in Leeds in 2001.</p>

<p>He also groped my friends bum when she worked in a caff on street lane when she was but a teenager.</p>

<p>Hmm, he has a long running reputation for that sort of thing. Another reason never to go in the Flying Pizza.</p>

<p><p>From wiki: "During Savile's lifetime, sporadic allegations of child abuse were made against him dating back to 1963,[97] but only became widely publicised after his death"...... after his death.... surprise surpise, media actively kept this story under wraps (BBC radio interview that they edited is one example of this). I actively want to find something which makes me think nope, this is not true, but the more you look, the more coincidences you find, the more that it seems you cant deny that something big has been happening and is still happening. </p></p>

<p><p>It goes all the way back to the Trojan War. Look at the stories of Agamemnon and Iphigenia and the stories of the House of Atreus. </p>
<p>The way she is described as behaving before his court. </p>
<p>The way he sacrificed her to appease Artemis in order for the Achaean ships to be able to sail to Ilium. It's all there. </p>
<p>Aeschylus' Agamemnon is the best source I have for these stories; the Iliad does not discuss them except in passing (and maybe not even then, it's been a while since I've read it). </p>
<p>I came to this revelation on the walk back to my apartment. I had to stop in the middle of a sidewalk to collect my thoughts. </p>
<p>The House of Atreus, Agamemnon's family, had a "curse" placed upon them where a family member would murder his brother's children and then feed the brother or another entity the children. The story that I immediately thought of what that of the Feast of Thyestes (sp?). </p>
<p>The House of Atreus was one of the great ruling families of Ancient Greece, Agamemnon and Menelaus were the two heroes of the House at the time of the Trojan War. </p>
<p>The accounts of the Achaeans' journey to Ilium have been lost to the ages. </p>
<p>Scary. </p></p>

<p>Joe [audibly]: "you're a good little girl"</p>

<p><p>13 year old girl (playing with her tits?) talk to my (daughter?)</p>
<p>What's creepy is it seriously sounds like your interpretation.</p>
<p>Edit: DEFINITELY SAYS Talk to his daughter (ashley) that's how I heard it and sure enough after looking it up that's his daughters name.</p>
<p>Edit2: Almost 100% sure he says "By the way, do you know how horny I get when a 13 year old girl has to stand in front of me, talk to my daughter Ashley."</p>
<p>Edit3: For the sake of integrity I tried to think of what else he might be saying that wouldn't be so blatant.
could be "By the way do you know how hard it is for a 13 year old girl to have to stand in front of me" idk audio is too fuzzy could just be very unfortunate sounding audio.</p></p>

<p><p>The word "Comet" has connotations within the occult.</p>
<p>http://www.occultopedia.com/c/comet.htm</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comets have always had an ominous reputation. In ancient times they were regarded as messengers of impending doom, such as the end of the world. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the political arena, such signs presaged a change in sovereignty, or the death of a very famous person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure if it means anything, but since we're laying out coded words and symbols, I figure it fits right in.</p>
<p>Also, the initials for CP. That's a thin connection IMO, but it is what it is.</p></p>
