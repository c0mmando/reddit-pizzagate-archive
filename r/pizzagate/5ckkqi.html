    I was looking into health inspections as a "secret" means of tracking where to go... What you said supports my idea that health inspectors are involved. Here's a repost of something I posted yesterday...
   </p>
   <p>
    Conspiracy Theory - The Dept. of Health was involved in some aspect of the food related child trafficking. Certain ratings like
    <strong>
     C+
    </strong>
    would be reserved only for perv restaurants and most people in the know could look for that
    <strong>
     C+
    </strong>
    to find a place nearby
   </p>
   <p>
    Folder of random pictures I dug out of a podesta spam email url
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.aeroelectric.com/Pictures/Misc/
   </p>
   <p>
    Picture of some place called 209 Curry Lane that was in that folder... baby pics in there and airplane parts too.

    Sketchy review of a "curry lane" on trip advisor
   </p>
   <p>
    "I was once on a bank/appraisal inspection on a building I was working on for an owner on East 6th Street and I'll tell you I will never eat there again. The restaurant was very small and narrow with only a stove in the rear. And I wondered where's all the food and refrigerator. It was lunch time and I kept seeing waiters coming up the stairs from the basement. When we went to inspect the boiler
    <strong>
     I opened the wrong door and there were a swarm of flies inside around a light bulb. In the room was a table with meat on it, in the open, and just sitting there.
    </strong>
    I can't believe these guys could pass a city health department restaurant inspection?"
   </p>
   <p>
    I think that is the one dude that had a legit review

     There was another thread which had a strange website with hidden pictures of food with lots of C+ ratings. I forget which site that was now. It was a child care site. I'm too tired to remember now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Do you have anything to back up with C+ claim?

      It's thin, but "+" = "plus".
     </p>
     <p>
      Plus starts with a P.
     </p>
     <p>
      So, C+ = CP.

      Who would be proud of a C+ rating?  A low rating of C+ also might scare away normal people expecting regular service.  The best front operation is going to be very slow.

     Hope you're archiving this stuff - I wish we had some sort of collaborative archiving/compilation system to keep track of all these leads and protect any online information from being scrubbed... granted, it may be too late for that sort of hindsight.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm still waiting for some real "hard evidence" to come to light though - so far we have a mountain of circumstantial evidence, but not a single video, image or "anonymous whistleblower" has shown up in this specific case, which you'd think would happen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Granted, we've had FBI Anon and a few other possible LARPers speak up and tell the /chans that they are on to something... but still no evidence.

      Tune into Foxnews... That Neil Cavuto guy isn't even really trying to cover that pizza means pedo anymore... I think if you eat the pizza on TV it means you would rather die than get caught or something. Some how today magically became National Pizza Day - Everything Except Anchovies.

        Different guests all bring it on to him and he says he's not going to eat it... and they keep urging NC to eat a slice and he always says he won't cause "It's cold." He teases some of em and asks why they don't like pizza... most that don't eat it say "I don't like pizza, I like meat." I've heard 3 guys say they prefer meat. (gay sex?)
       </p>
       <p>
        One girl guest he asked if she liked pizza and she said "yes" and they giggled then she said something like... "are you guys talking about something else?"

         I can't watch this right now; but I'm infuriated with the fact that they are making a joke of this! It's the same BS that they use to discredit UFO sightings. I'm doing my best to hold back a rush of profanity for these assholes! I only hope that there is a Hell, and that they get an eternity of what's been done to these children!

         WFT! At the end, there was a pizza slice image with the illuminati pyramid AND the eye!!!!
        </p>
        <p>
         The writing on the pizza before said "S8 or PI". WTF! There is a coded message here, for sure. Not sure how relevant this is now though....

          It was SK8 or Pi... Like Skate or Die... but I have seen the that SK8 thing come up in conjunction with the Pizza Pipeline

          The S8 PI text also above brought me to PI TRUCK PIZZA:

          Some more pics of children with strange reviews as follows:
         </p>
         <p>
          "Toddler approved Pi! If you have toddlers you know how hard it can be to get them to eat. Both of my children loved Pi truck pizza but it was the first time my almost 3 year old son actually ate his pizza. With each bite he exclaimed Yummy! Pizza!"

          Not sure anything particularly relevant here, but the illuminati image got me curious.

           Well, what do you know... As it turns out, kids like pizza.
          </p>
          <p>
           Or does it mean that if your kid likes pizza, then that means that your a pedophile?
          </p>
          <p>
           C'mon guys! I do believe there's something bigger with Comet Ping Pong, but this is just ridiculous. Sometimes, a pizza is just a pizza.

             I just don't think that every pizza place is a front to some pedophilia underground. We should probably get more evidence before we start accusing businesses and people for something as serious this.

            Tough telling... I'm too far down the rabbit hole and too unfamiliar with children to know if this behavior is normal... or part of some brainwashing technique.

             The symbol is interesting, then again, people love using satanic symbols (pentagram and ram's head, for instance) even if they don't necessarily believe in it. His subscriptions are worth looking into, though. One of them, at least, seems to be devoted to mysticism and stuff like that...
            </p>
            <p>
             As for the video itself, I don't see anything wrong with it. It's a kid that likes pizza. You'd be hard pressed to find a kid who doesn't love pizza. She's young, so she wouldn't be able to fully construct sentences or articulate her thoughts yet. I don't see any real evidence of brainwashing going on, and don't know why anyone would need to be "brainwashed" into loving pizza.
            </p>
            <p>
             It has only 12 views, so it was probably posted to show their family (grandparents) a video of the girl. If it was for pedophilia purposes, it would probably have more views.

           The comment by Dawn Ott Knapp is curious too. Look at her page, a little suspect. Baby pin in profile pic right over the eye (covering one eye is known secret society/occultic "tell"), halloween theme, works at Women's Opportunity Center and look at that logo!

         Yeah... its the first "National Pizza With Everything (Except Anchovies) Day" suspiciously absent from calendars until very recently... I honestly don't think it existed until Nov 9th... which was also a National Pizza Day.

          Its not the very first. Just a few comments below you is someone linking a youtube video from 11/12/14 about "national pizza with everything except anchovies day"

          I think the the CP stuff is real, but we're barking up the wrong tree here

           Weird... cause I posted that link below... and I swear it said 2016 when I did it... but now it says 2016, the account creation dates for the comments on it don't contradict that, so I'd guess I was just mistaken.

            Oh ok, sorry I don't pay attention to usernames as much as I should. I agree though, if they just made that day up today it would be suspicious to say the least

    Only reach-in refrigerator and fridge. I remember seeing the photo of the walk-in cooler, but was it linked to comet ping pong?. Atleast it was in their instagram, but it strips off the exif data, so can't know the location for certain i guess, unless they talk about it in the comments of the pic.
   </p>
   <p>
    Do you have a link for the pic in instagram?
   </p>

      Then again, if it was the owner of comet ping pong who uploaded that picture, where else he could've built a walk-in freezer.

       Right.  I
       <em>
        assume
       </em>
       it is part of the restaurant but you never know.

        Don't they own another restaurant like 2 doors down? Bucks or whatever? Could have been there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Could also just have been shopping, looking at a buddy's new freezer at another restaurant, etc.
       </p>
       <p>
        Or, it could be a secret basement freezer located 1000 feet below the surface of the earth.
       </p>
       <p>
        Problem is, nothing is too speculative for this story... the sorts of shit we're hearing about leave a LOT of room for the imagination to run.

         I know! And that's what's so "fun" about poring through all this research theyre doing.  It gives you an excuse to just concoct the craziest theories and instead of saying "Pssh, yeah right" you're saying "but what if though.."
        </p>
        <p>
         Tunnels and secret passages are completely, completely within the realm of possibility considering we're talking about DC.  I guarantee you there are tunnels leading into and out of the white house.  Where they lead or end or what parts of the city are accessible through them is anyone's guess.
        </p>
        <p>
         But we're talking about people with money, LOTS of money at their disposal.  The cartels have been building advanced tunnels for years.  You're gonna tell me the people that run the country can't figure it out? They probably have some of the best engineers in the country down there.  Who knows?

         Yes. However, they often lead to other theories and bring people together with unique perspectives and resources. Knowing how insanely corrupt health departments can be, I think there are some good leads shared, here.

        The actual freezer/fridge photo makes it clear the walk in is old. Not sure if he owns it, he just said "this looks like fun" or something similar and then commented #murder after people mentioned a kill room.

        I know lots of wealthy folks and nobody has anything close to this. It is even very oversized for a an establishment like CPP.

          Honestly I cannot think of a reason person would need that big of a walk in. Also think of the true cost and if not used, waste. It really seem like it is for something creepy. It could very well be inside the building that is not officially a part of the restaurant. My grandmother had a little small town hair salon and an apartment above it. That apartment was never subject to any kind of health related regulations.
         </p>
         <p>
          This very well could be sectioned off. Also remember the digging... They literally could have installed that cooler and connected a drain line directly to the city sewer system. So that comment about "hosing it down" and killing floor could be literal. THEN take that in context with the creepy video. A quick flash of light reveals the person on the mic is wearing sunglasses and a face covering and a scarf AND a wig. They possibly did not want to be recognized. What if what they were discussing was a pedo snuf show, or event.
         </p>
         <p>
          You really would have to be writing a horror movie to think of this shit. Yet there it is.

      Owner of comet ping pong is James ALEFANTIS. Which turns out is REALLY close to the french meaning of "i love kids"

      Some anons had an idea that his name might be pseudonym and translated the owners name, and translated i like kids and it was pretty damn close to james alefontis the owner.
     </p>

      He wears shirts that in french would basically translate to 'i like kids' https://i.sli.mg/ON22AY.png

       To be fair, the shirt is in reference to

        L'Enfant Cafe &amp; Bar

        Was just about to point that out. Though it might be worth seeing if they sell shirts or other merchandise like that. I can't find anything on their website, but it could be an in-store only thing or a promotional item. /shrug

       It translates to "I like the kid". It could also be some place called "L'Enfant".

        Except for the fact that his shirt is referring to L'Enfant Cafe &amp; Bar, not children. It's in the upper right of
        <a href="https://i.sli.mg/ON22AY.png">
         this photo.
        </a>
        . It does not translate to "children," it means "the child." As observant as you all think you are, you still overlook some very obvious things whenever they don't confirm your suspicions. Bear in mind that when you blow up something insignificant, or worse, something false, you only serve to discredit yourselves.

          Yeah sure, so this guy takes a photo with 2 gay men and with a shirt that correlates with all the content on his instagram and you call it a coincidence.
         </p>
         <p>
          The shirt says "I love l'enfant"-- let's do "j'aime l'enfant"
         </p>
         <p>
          Look..it translates to I LOVE CHILDREN.

           The shirt was presumably bought at the cafe they were at. The cafe was called "L'Enfant" If it comes out that James Alefantes changed his name to "James Alefantes", then I would say its pretty damming. But right now, it seems like there's a reasonable explanation as to why his shirt would say "I love kids"

    This place sounds disgusting. They essentially followed no hygiene rules and if I'm read this right, they didn't have auditable records of all their sales and purchases.

     Doesn't that bring into question whether the place is even profitable? Or if it isn't just a propped-up business that serves a secondary purpose.

      I mean we'd probably need more than a 1 page health inspection record to know for sure. But yeah the impression I got is that they didn't have records surrounding their ingredients at the very least.

      As I mentioned somewhere else, I don't think we can draw an iron proof conclusion on a one page health report, although my boyfriend is a chef and he said that it's a pretty detailed report compared to what he gets out here in california. Regardless, it does indicate a poor quality of hygiene and management and I'm left wondering how the hell this place is so popular, especially among children and gov't officials.

    Do you have any other restaurants that do have a walk in to compare?

    The "Kill Room" on JimmyComet (Comet Ping Pongs Owners) Instagram had no

     mention of it being Comet's walk in

     Every restaurant that myself or my boyfriend has ever worked in had a walk in. Even dairy queen and denny's have walk ins. Domino's does too. I'd assume this applies to pretty much all restaurants with any kind of volume, and comet ping pong seems fairly popular.

      I agree.. i use to work at a popular fast food restaurant and they had a walk in too, BUT it was no where the size of the one James posted. Maybe it was only 1/4 of it, and it was a much busier place that was open 24/7. Unless it's not for comet ping pong, the size is very suspicious.

     It's not unusual for a restaurant that uses fresh, local ingredients to not have a giant walk-in. It mentions a reach-in. So that makes the IG pic even more suspicious. I used to manage a Quiznos. We had a freezer walk-in and a refrigerated walk-in. The size of the one in the pic is ridiculous. It looks like a walk-in that a butcher would utilize.

      Yes. I've been in restaurants that do $200K per week witha walk-in half that size. High end pizza, too.

      Most places that serve a lot of draft will have a special cooler for that. But that was a very large cooler, either way.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Edit:
      </strong>
      Don't see any draft on their menu, so if it belongs to that location, it's for food. Inspectors don't look at coolers they don't know about (obviously). I know somoene who keeps food in the beer cooler, and inspector never goes in there.

     Very few restaurants do not have a walk-in. I've been in at least 60, and have only seen one or two; and they didn't do well.

      The ONLY DJ I've seen is related to Google Street view, of a black truck on the adjacent street. Black and red are associated with satanistic coloring schemes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The stickers on the back of the truck say,
      <a href="https://i.sli.mg/y3bfNM.png">
       "DJ ALAS"
      </a>
      or DJ something or other, I can't be sure. Its a far stretch, I know, but it looks like there are
      <a href="https://i.sli.mg/sytoPY.png">
       two K9 unit escorts
      </a>
      in front of him and a
      <a href="https://i.sli.mg/QR05Xl.png">
       white van
      </a>
      which incidentally, does happen to have a "Leviathan/satanistic" emblem on it. Look around on google street view.
     </p>
     <p>
      Just throwing this out there for analysis, if warranted.

       One of the commenters on many of the Alefantis Instagram pics, and associates of Alefantis was Arun Rao, DOJ chief of the Southern District. His purview? Child Sex Trafficking.
       <a href="https://i.sli.mg/c551rN.jpg">
        Ref 1
       </a>
       <a href="https://i.sli.mg/ltwY5Z.png">
        Ref 2
       </a>
       <a href="https://i.sli.mg/s5xPgP.jpg">
        Ref 3
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the eyes on the child in Ref 3. Those look like the eyes of child who has seen trauma. Why would a prosecutor from the DOJ like that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Incidentally, when these images went live on the chans, the threads immediately started getting 404'd.

      From what I found it means "What Would Donald Judd Do" where he's a minimalist artist.  So you have a minimalist blank slate how would Donald build this out?

     yeah, we need someone to go down there.. at least first to scout it out. Act like a normal customer, buy a pizza and leave.. go back next day or so.. use bathroom, "get lost", walk around.. and so forth. need "boots" on the ground.

      Holy shit - no to your Day 2 Plan.  If Pizzagate is for real, then keep in mind these fuckers have no problem killing CHILDREN.

      To start snooping around, you need at least 3 buddies, armed with firearms and well trained in close quarters combat.

    A lot of news breaking in the past few days about inspections of pizza places... I think thats the media sending out the "we're busted... run!" alert.

      They don't realize thousands of people are looking into this and reporting back. Even with a massive smokescreen and red herrings, we're still on the right track.

    Just saying.  I used to work at a pizza place when I was younger with pretty high traffic, and as far as I know there was no walk in fridge.  Just closet sized fridges where they stored the dough and ingredients.  Im not suprised at all that they dont have a walk in fridge.

     I think the reason this is shocking to some is because there was a photo of a walk in cooler/freezer on that eerie Comet Ping Pong Instagram... but no reference of it here in the inspection.

     I've worked a lot of restaurants before and that is the LARGEST walk in freezer  I've seen. That's a freezer for a large butchering facility not a restaurant.

     I don't know. But I think the contention is that the most sinister elements are in a secret underground area. It would probably take an inside, undercover operation to get into the belly of the beast, so to speak.

    Speaking of "Walk in coolers"...
   </p>
   <p>
    The IG post that "JimmyCommet" shows a WALK IN COOLER (and describes with #Murder) The IG poster MoChef103 ("Mo"= Molester) says "But its so big" to which GordysPickleJar says: "Mama Big".
   </p>
   <p>
    It is a reference to MamasMidwives.com.
   </p>
   <p>
    I am willing to bet there is a channel or facet of these fuckers that are selling harvested organs after the fact A la': Planned Parenthood.
   </p>
   <p>
    I am willing to bet there are some links there.

      If I have to connect the dots, the bad guys are going to take the shit down. Fuck it- This is my contribution:
     </p>
     <p>
      http://mamasmidwives.com/our-families/
     </p>
     <p>
      Go to bottom of page...
     </p>
     <p>
      http://mamasmidwives.com/maeve-chaim/
     </p>
     <p>
      Then read this email:
     </p>
     <p>
      https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5252
     </p>
     <p>
      That is the SAME Maeve that is going to be "in that pool"... the one who is "almost 7".
     </p>
     <p>
      http://mamasmidwives.com/maeve-chaim/
     </p>
     <p>
      They are fucking BREEDING THEM... and harvesting them. I am sure.
     </p>
     <p>
      So... maybe that cooler is a cooler. For the tissue they harvest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Holy shit- ONE OF THE COMMENTS MENTIONS HOW IT LOOK LIKE "A sheet over a pile of money"...
     </p>
     <p>
      Sheets over bodies- like a morgue. They are going to harvest and store tissue. Just like Jimmy Comet mentions kids and BUSINESS... he is mentioning here how a big secret cooler (Mama big!) that "looks like money".

       1) Chill pill, bro, no need to call me 'you fucks'
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I've seen that email, it's highly suspicious, but I don't see how the Mama's Midwives page adds anything substantial. The grandmother also maintains a blog, as far as I can tell the only thing these sources add is confirmation of who the children in the email are. What are you seeing there that I'm not? Is the age of the child significant to you?

        own the "Farm" that is being discussed elsewhere.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have Jimmy Comet, who welds child sized coffins for fun, showing pictures of a huge cooler that he does not have a permit for. He used the description #Murder in the IG post. He also says how it looks like it is hiding a "pile of money".
       </p>
       <p>
        Then GordysPickleJar says that it is "Mama Big"...
       </p>
       <p>
        In Jimmy Comets IG posts: Babies= Money.
In the real world: Dead Babies=Money.

         The recut to hell PP vids from the Breitbart 'journalist' with the history of altering evidence to misrepresent his subjects and support his unfounded narratives?
        </p>
        <p>
         Look, I think it's super weird that a Chaim is became a Luzatto, that grammie L keeps a grandbaby blog, that the family has political connections all the way up to Podesta, that those kids were brought up to the farm via Uber without their family, but have you considered taking a step back and reassess your evidence. What is clearest? What is more of a maaaaaybe? What is most tenuous?

         We're all on the same team, let's be sure we don't miss things that might be more significant by jumping to conclusions.

      Big coolers like that get delivered via oversize load. They have drains for the condensation, and massive power and ventilation needs.
