        <strong>David Brock was blackmailed via paedophilia into switching sides and working for the Clintons. Discuss.</strong>
        <p><p>Anyone else think this guys sudden about-face from conservative journalist to grovelling lackey of the Clintons seem really suspicious?</p>
<p>Roger Stone said he thought it was all about "the money". Starting to think they had major dirt and turned this guy into a pliant stooge.</p>
<p>In fact, I'm starting to think everyone connected to the Clintons is a compromised pedophile. </p></p>

        <p><p>Look into Christopher Ruddy, the guy who runs Newsmax. Used to be heavily right wing. Hell, he wrote the most famous book on the Vince Foster case in the 90s.</p>
<p>However something seems to of changed his mind, as he gave 1 million to the Clinton Foundation.

<p>He is even pictured with Bill Clinton in a few photos.</p>
<p>I think you're on to something. </p></p>

        <p><p>Really interesting.</p>
<p>Just checked wikileaks for Ruddy's name. Yep, he's in contact with Podesta, writing articles about how great the foundation is. PUKE.</p>
