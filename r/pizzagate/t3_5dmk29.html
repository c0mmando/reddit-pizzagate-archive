<p><p>Hey, looks good!</p>
<p>I'm wondering if we can do something to make it catch people's attention more since it doesn't exactly scream pedophilia. I have seen a few people suggesting that we even change the hashtag to #pedogate. There are so many ___gates out there that it may come across as just some money scheme involving pizza. It also looks like it could be a pizza company. </p>
<p>Wonder if there is something child related you could add to it without cluttering the image too much, cause I really like how simple it is.</p></p>

<p>Good suggestion, I was thinking the same thing.  I can actually kind of agree about how #pedogate might be better, but we should keep in mind that this whole thing started with the weird innuendos of pizza in the emails.</p>
<p>edit: http://i.imgur.com/dNqr8Q9.jpg larger version if printing ever comes into play.</p></p>

<p><p>That looks awesome. Can you add a teardrop to her face? Or something to signify that the child is sad. Maybe add a little emotion to it, make people wonder "Why is this little girl with a pizza on her head sad?" Instead of wondering "Why does this little girl have a pizza on her head?"</p>
<p>Just a suggestion. But as it is, I think the logo looks great.</p></p>

<p><p>What about with a backdrop of D.C. monuments or The Whitehouse. Might be starting to become too much, but it would be cool to see what you could do. </p>
<p>The pickets on the gate look like The Washington Monument. Just an observation.</p></p>

<p><p>i was kinda going for lining up the fence lines with the facial features, having the gate in line with the chin curve, and having the black negative space of the gate opening be at the center weight of the head.</p></p>

<p><p>Get rid of the pizza. Seriously, just listen. No matter what, this will never be taken serious with a pizza slice right there, NO MATTER WHAT PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS CORRELATE A SLICE OF PIZZA WITH YUMMY FOOD. Not to mention the hundreds of crazy theories that hold no value or substance being related to it (thanks to CTR, Shills..etc) now </p>
<p>I'm not sure the answer, if we can some how take the Idea of the pizza and turn it into something the public will take a bit more serious. As everything stands right now this is the face of it, but we can change that. We have new info and we know WHO/WHAT (clinton foundation) organization this surrounds. Lets use that to our advantage!!</p>
<p>I know there is a genius out there who can do this.</p></p>

<p><p>Yea, having slept on it, I kind of agree a new direction should be explored.  I've got a new idea, a bit more technical in execution, but anyone feel free to take a stab.  It'll be a giant uncooked disc of pizza dough draped over the form of a child's lifeless body like a white sheet at a crime scene.  And sauce, cheese and toppings will be carelessly poured overtop.  And the child's hand is peeking out from underneath. </p>
<p>That said, I still think a simple logo has its place.  The one I originally posted is a good template if people want to make construction paper signs if this ever gets taken to the street for example. </p></p>

<p><p>Not a bad idea, if you can some how maybe mix the child in with the Clinton Foundation. Do you know what their logo is..actually maybe it can be a spin on that!!?</p></p>

<p><p>Pedogate is a much better hashtag, and that's why I think we should hold off a bit before using it. Hear me out. We're getting glimpses of just how big and far-reaching these rings are, but we're still waiting for actual trails that connect global figures to all of this. However, I believe this might be coming soon, either from our own research or from leaks within the gov't.</p>
<p>I think #pizzagate is good enough for referring to the Podesta/Alefantis/Clinton connections and the information that kicked off this whole investigation. But if/when we get a major lead that shows the global nature of this, we need to push the pedogate hashtag hard.</p></p>

<p><p>Definitely.  No reason we can't pivot to a new hashtag as things develop.  Or use both. </p></p>

<p><p>A couple of things to consider:</p>
<p>1) "Pizzagate" is burbling in searches, obfuscating the real "pizzagate" with another eponymous named scandal involving the soccer team Arsenal.  It's probably the way the algorithm works - digging up something old.  But you never know;</p>
<p>2) "Pizzagate" unfortunately, sounds too innocent.  However, the name has taken root at this point.  Hell, I can't even enjoy pizza the way I used to;</p>
<p>3) #Pedogate should be tandem tagged to #Pizzagate.  The "pedo" is for shock.  It is needed in the narrative.</p>

<p><p>A comment above makes the argument that this investigation hasn't enough evidence to push into the public eye yet, we still need to dig deeper if we want to be believed; THEN we can worry about marketing. </p></p>

<p><p>Depends which direction you're going to take your video, but the Illuminati trading card "Pizza Party" is pretty damn impressionable. </p>
<p>I have no idea whether it's real or fake though. On the internet I could only find a picture in bad resolution and I've lost it. I didn't bother to confirm whether it was a legitimate card in the original series. Looked real though.</p>
<p>Logo looks awesome by the way.</p></p>

<p><p>In the near future, we will have enough preponderance of evidence and have compiled it in such a consumable format, that we will be ready to go full force on the awareness campaign.  Until then, we need people digging and people assembling what's been dug. </p>
<p>And I know you're well intentioned, but if every police department and intelligence agency in the WORLD has been quiet about this for decades, and if everyone who investigates it gets murdered, no one in their right mind would take on that job alone.  The investigators need to be basking in the full light of the public eye.  That way they will not be able to murder anyone without the world knowing the jig is up. </p></p>

<p><p>While I agree that bringing in an outside agency could be a huge mistake, I also still think we need local Gumshoes on the ground at least tracking POI's current movements and activities, eyewitness accounts and whatnot. We simply cannot rely on any media source for information on these people.</p></p>

<p><p>All this does is add on time to an effort folks at the grassroots who are already doing this.  In my humble opinion, this year alone proves the grassroots force, strength (ex. the_donald and 4chan) and ability to permeate mainstream normie world and MSM. </p>
<p>Do you honestly expect to find a private eye who would take this on? No, i suspect investigators want to keep their lives. Pizza/pedogate is too big and risky for your option -- again, imho.</p></p>

<p><p>You should change the background to the color of cheese and use that red for pepperoni.</p></p>

<p><p>Check out my revision in the comment above.  I think it hits the necessary bases.  Does that fit your suggestion?</p>
<p>Also, since you mention it, I think we should generally avoid trying to sensationalize the story with a sinister style.  When I watch conspiracy videos, the hardest thing for me to get past is the dramatization, spooky effects, and orchestra stabs.  When the message is packaged in a loaded intention, people turn away because they don't want to be told what to think (at least that's my gut reaction).  I personally don't think this story needs any embellishment.  This is as fucked up as it gets and I feel like the facts stand on their own.</p>
<p>Although, now that I see that new banner, that does look pretty solid.  I'm open to suggestions.</p></p>

<p><p>Excellent idea! I like the logo you've created, but I would remove the pepperoni because it takes away from the code word "Cheese Pizza". </p></p>

<p><p>Small suggestion,  why not have a "mascot" as part of this "brand"  cartoon mascots have been used to relay messages for years.  </p>
<p>You could go on graphicriver.net find gaming characters with useanle photoshop files for around $10 bucks. The gaming tiles would give you psd files and premade poses for the character. This character can help disseminate and break down issues for normies. Anyone see that Black Mirror episode withbthe bear?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the fencing makes it a bit complicated and no lie, i first thought of football and the fences fans hold up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the silhouette, pizza and gate art styles and color scheme are a bit disconnected, meaning, it clearly like like 3 separately sourced design elements layered one on top of another. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keep the gate. Instead of wood, use pizza toppings, toys and words like "help me" "im here" to form the shape of the gate (collage art). Alt, you could find a pizza topping psd or ai pattern to start from. Just add kid toys and words).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have a small kid behind the gate. This should be a fugure without any features and details. If the figure is detail-less, it could be anyone (congruent to the fawkes mask idea.. we are everyone)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>play with contrast</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use bold, well contrasted font to set text over the new pizzagate.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider a  tagline at the bottom of it
  -- it should be emotional
  -- it should be a lead in statement
  -- it should be compelling and persuasive (start the story just enough  so the viewer is curious enough to seek  information... taglines in the form of questions generally perform well in these scenarios)
    --- if you want to be reallllly spicy, the tagline statement can be from the pov of a child, asking the adult viewer for something,  like help</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea of giving this investigation a brand is powerful. Awesome job doing this!! I think folks should take it seriously. And it'll be easier to help this go viral. I just think given the nature and gravity of Pizzagate, a few more iterations, maybe a new option b mock could be good.</p></p>

<p><p>thanks for the detailed input!  I think the latest version with the tear is getting to the right place with your guys' help. </p>
<p>I think a walkthrough mascot would be inappropriate for this subject.  I think our common humanity pierces right through the screen with pizzagate. </p>
<p>The tagline is a good call.  First one that comes to my mind would be <strong>"A Parent Never Stops Looking."</strong></p></p>

<p><p>here's my contribution:</p>
<p>how about we consider: pizzafiles ? maybe pezzafiles? maybe have a word begining with D above the "zz" e.g. 
Disturbing
Pizzafiles 
(this way maybe the mind can subconsciously substitute the D for ZZ and make it pidafiles or pedafiles)</p>
<p>Another suggestion: on the slice of pizza, give it a face - eyes, sad face, maybe a tear. maybe give it a skirt and a balloon but the string on which its held is actually used to tie the hands - these hands are holding the bars on the gate. </p>
<p>All in all this will link Pizza to something human. </p></p>

<p><p>its alright but i think my suggestion makes it a bit more powerful. raises questions of:</p>
<p>1) why is there a mixed message of happiness (i.e. balloons, maybe add something else) vs tears? tied hands? 
2) gate is locked = trapped.
3) why is this pizza so human? </p>
<p>whilst i like your newer version better it sort of reminds of some board game from back in the day (cant rmb which one) and doesn't raise any interesting thoughts. </p>
<p>this is what im thinking off:
1) BUT SAD FACE (maybe with some semblence of clothes? skirt? perhaps some blood on floor? sad face etc obvs)</p>
<p>http://us.123rf.com/450wm/lemonoff/lemonoff1609/lemonoff160900106/63226374-3d-illustration-slice-of-pizza-funny-cartoon-character-pizza-with-eyes-hands-and-legs-cartoon-style.jpg?ver=6</p>
<p>2) this is what i mean by tied hands  --&gt; but literally more like handcuffs (perhaps several ballons? maybe a message on them too?)</p>
<p>http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/df778f1078bb4606ab6b4761bed93234/a-womans-hands-tying-a-balloon-string-on-the-wrist-of-a-young-girl-bxfgr3.jpg</p>
<p>and again, bump for my pizzafiles (with a word begining with D above it, e.g. Disturbing)</p></p>

<p><p>I think the balloon hand cuff thing might actually work.  I'm picturing a black silhouetted boy on his knees facing away slightly with the balloons yanking up at his hands, centered atop a pizza cut in a pentagram pattern.  Thanks for the idea!  </p>
<p>As for the cartoon pizza, I'll let someone else take that up as I just don't see a pizza guy evoking a meaningful emotional response, but I'd be glad to be proven wrong. </p>
<p>Thirdly, I think Disturbing Pizzaphiles sounds a little clickbaity.  the convention of #____gate is pretty established at this point and would get more clicks imo.  Not trying to be a dick, but that's my honest impression.  I appreciate the discussion!</p></p>

<p><p>no worries. its mostly because they began raising the Arsenal vs Man Utd pizzagate story. as an Arsenal fan i can admit that it was real and i remember it from back in the day. knowing Googles algorithim fucking we might need to consider doing a seperate tag or do 2 at same. Also i said "pizza FILES" not philes. so its really subliminal with the D replacement. </p>
<p>perhaps maybe combine them? pizzagate the Disturbing story of Pizzafiles </p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>pizza guy is meant to be really really sad (obvs couldnt find one like that on google) but as i have 0 skill in this area all i can offer up is suggestions.</p>
<p>good luck and god speed.</p>
<p>dont go to gym any time soon. </p></p>

<p><p>Also, it just struck me, the subliminal thing you're going for works well for the UK pronunciation of pedophile (<em>pee</em>-dah-file), but at least in the states it's <em>peh</em>-duh-file.  I agree on your point about using 2 tags.  Pizzagate will stick around for a while in the discussion, and will be known as the origin, but whatever we pair it with will take off as the main tagline. </p></p>

<p><p>my old ass version of Illustrator doesn't seem to have helvetica, but I'm searching for an appropriate one.  It's kind of tricky to choose one that properly captures the seriousness of it.  suggestions or images of your own fonts are very welcome.  Also, if you guys like the tagline I mentioned, "A Parent Never Stops Looking." you can send it along with your own tagline ideas. </p></p>

<p><p>Nice effort, I think the white picket fence looks a little dorky though. It needs a gate that is satanic or evil looking. Like from castlevania: </p>
