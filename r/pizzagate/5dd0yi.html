    Hello lads.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm looking for links between James Alefantis and Jeff Koons. I know Alefantis posted photos of Koons' art on his IG but I am looking for something less tenuous. I remember hearing they were members of the same art associations/clubs/groups, can anyone confirm that?
   </p>
   <p>
    Any help is greatly appreciated, I'll be rolling out my latest research soon so if you'd like a cite for your efforts let me know.

    A couple weeks ago or so there was a PDF of everybody who was paid by Correct The Record. I think it was a tax filing. It was on The Donald. Jeff Koons was paid $50,000 by Correct The Record (and CTR's David Brock's former boyfriend is the Comet Pizza guy).
   </p>
   <p>
    Jeff Koons's name and the address of his studio were listed. Why was he paid $50k by CTR? For what purpose?

     Any chance you could direct me to that PDF? That's exactly what I was looking for.

     EDIT: Found, thanks.

      Way more disturbing is the logo on page 19... wtf.

       Got to find as many links to DC as I can, Alefantis/Podestas/David Brock. I'm pursuing the lead till it's exhausted.

        James Alefantis/Comet Pizza mentioned in WASH 2010 on Page 58 by Joe Ireland (has this name been investigated?) - http://digital.modernluxury.com/publication/index.php?i=9968&amp;m=&amp;l=&amp;p=96&amp;pre=&amp;ver=swf
       </p>
       <p>
        Joe Ireland (Principle, J.D. Ireland Design)
The Spot: Comet Ping Pong.
The Seat: "Any seat in the house. All the table have been custom-made to resemble ping pong tables. They also have a really cool, beautiful bar that has a velum back and a pink glow."
Time of Day: "In the evenings, with clients or friends."
The Order: "Comet's thing is brick oven pizza and I go with the Ace: Roasted eggplant, peppers, onions, mozzarella. It's got a great, smoky taste to it. And root beer. That's the only place I'll drink a root beer."
The Scene: "It's cool and relaxed, and the interior is completely different than anything else you'll see in DC. The owner, James Alefantis, is heavily involved with Transformer Art Gallery and other arts organizations in the city, so you get a really coo mix of artists, business types, and young families there."

        James Alefantis in WASH 2008 Digital Luxury - http://digital.modernluxury.com/publication/?i=9965

       <p>
        Article direct link: http://digital.modernluxury.com/article/Aesthetes_In_Residence/88866/0/article.html
“To understand gallery guru James Alefantis, you’ll fi rst have to translate his mile-a-minute monologues. Th e board president of the nonprofi t gallery Transformer also co-owns the super stylish restaurants Comet Ping Pong and Buck’s Fishing &amp; Camping. But it’s his red-hot love aff air with DC’s art world that he sustains with a self-proclaimed case of adult ADD and an entrepreneurial energy that never runs dry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Home for the local boy is a six-bedroom manse in Kalorama with his partner, writer David Brock. Styles merge as Brock favors chintz and Alefantis leans modern. Together they’ve covered the place with quirky found objects, patterned antiques and work from rising stars Lucy Hogg, Scott Treleaven and Piero Passacantando. “When I started working with young artists, suddenly all the great crosscurrents between diff erent creative worlds merged together to become a single unique community,” he says.
       </p>
       <p>
        Armed with his crop of artful endeavors, the curly-haired comedian turns the spotlight on the city’s low-flying artists any way he can. Beyond the shows at Transformer, he slated Dupont tech-master James Huckenpahler to curate a show for the opening of Buck’s and closed down Comet to host fêtes for Meat Market gallery, the Washington Ballet, Gypsy Eyes Records and the entire 2008 Corcoran graduating class.
       </p>
       <p>
        The former thespian has a knack for design beyond his home. He helped fashion the blueprint for his pie joint with CORE Architects’s Peter Hapstak. He also renovated Strand on Volta, where, during a three-year stint as gallery director, he cultivated crowds so large they spilled onto the street. “I saw the value in supporting the more avant-garde expressionists,” he says. “I’ve gained more than I could ever have imagined.”

    Koons is on the board of some missing children foundation.  Art is used for money laundering also.  Alefantis is top 50 influencers in Washington, so I'm sure they're cosy.
