        <strong>What happened last night?</strong>
        <p><p>Some shithead anons claimed to have 2gd mega dump. We freaked out for a while - the mods acted weird, flagged it as a honeypot and erased it. 
1) If it was actually a honeypot it would of been much different i think, the retarded whistle blowing anons won't be an effective way to charge people - they can claim it was for anything but the CP / only download the pdfs or whatever </p>
<p>2) I (heard from a friend) about a fuckload of horrible CP on /pol/ last night being posted in the /ewo/, /pizzagate/, threads. Rather than /pol/ mods deleted the CP, they would prune the whole thread. He says he hasn't seen CP out in the open on 4chan like that since the pre-jail bait ban on gif. (when they really started cracking down)</p>
<p>ANYWAY - wtf happened? just retarded anons? FBI trap? sketchy fake mods reking honest warriors? </p></p>

        <p><p>It is a fine line, fellas, between censorship and an outright conspiracy clusterfuck.  We are walking that line as carefully as possible.  The "hoax" was at least interesting to watch develop, no?  </p></p>

        <p><p>I am very happy we were allowed to see this to completion.  It should be up to the community to decide what is a hoax, not the moderators.</p></p>

        <p><p>agreed, we are trying to curate stuff, and be relatively hands off.  occasionally we need to intervene to make sure we fall in line with TOS.  Also there is obviously disinfo and shitposting galore, but the sub is active enough to downvote most of it so we can maintain a level of credibility</p></p>

        <p><p>posting CP was a crazy strategy at the start.  Then it just got more and more incompetent when they had no clue about encryption standards...</p></p>

        <p><p>Ok ok you're right. We spent a little too long (as most of us were) trying to figure out if there were any good leads (and there were) but in the future this is a wake-up call to all of us.</p></p>

        <p><p>I watched it all go down in real time...got my hopes up that it was about to break and then nothing.</p>
<p>The only thing I don't understand is what was the goal of this?  A honeypot would have been better coordinated, and posting highly illegal shit just to get attention does not seem logical.</p>
<p>Could it have been someone connected to comet trying to make us look like we were just targeting innocent people by introducing WTP as a red herring?</p>
<p>Something else I wonder...I am pretty sure that the FBI keeps a database of known child porn images/video.  I wonder if this was known or unknown content?  The implication if it was unknown could be a big deal.</p></p>

I just can't imagine 10 pics of kids like that all for a hoax.</p></p>
