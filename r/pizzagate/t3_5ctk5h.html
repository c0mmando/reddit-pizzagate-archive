<strong>(Newbie here) Can someone cherry pick and compile the most compelling pieces of evidence?</strong>
<p><p>So I read through the links on the sidebar, but there is so much information that is either so deep or so circumstantial I feel lost.  There are some major red flags that seemed very suspicious (to me at least), such as the emails that make no sense if not speaking in code (the "playing dominoes on pizza or pasta" or something like that, the map drawn on the handkerchief, etc...) and the really creepy spirit cooking.  Can you guys point me towards some other major ones?  Thanks in advance</p></p>

<p><p>i try to stay as open minded as possible, but there are some huge leaps in logic being made</p></p>

<p><p>Perhaps this has already been addressed but I certainly haven't seen it - can anyone prove that it is the <em>SAME</em> Ibrahima Diallo that owns Besta Pizza and is connected to the Clintons? And not just two people with the same name.</p>
<p>I ask this because if not, throwing in the Guinean left-back would have the equal result.</p></p>
