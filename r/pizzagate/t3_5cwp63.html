        <strong>Remember those "cages?" I don't think they are cages. Gotta burst this bubble, sorry.</strong>
        <p><p>I think they are proofing racks, racks where you put pizza dough on so it can sit around and, with time, the yeast causes it to rise.</p>
<p>They seem to be the correct height for proofing racks, but not for any cage I've ever seen. It doesnt seem to have vertical bars, only horizontal ones, which doesnt often correspond to cages but certainly would be correct for proofing racks. You put the dough on these plastic trays, then they slide in vertically, then you put em in a cooler for a day or so, and then they are ready to become pizzas. </p>
<p>And thats the final nail in this cage's coffin. It could only be a proofing rack for pizza dough if it's a pizza restaurant, which it is. If it were a sandwich shop, they would have no need for a pizza dough proofing rack, and it would be suspicious. But it IS a pizza place, so it just fits too well for me.</p>
<p>I'm sure if you google these racks you will see what I mean, but I can't paste links from this phone for some reason and I'm not dedicated enough to proving my thesis that I will type out those huge strings of letters and numbers that they use for urls.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work guys.</p></p>
