        <strong>A few thoughts...</strong>
        <p><ul>
<li>
<p>One week ago I accurately <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5ct0cw/how_the_media_will_approach_this_story_if_and/">predicted</a> how the media would respond to Pizza gate.   Not that this required any great powers of foresight on my part.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remarks by Alefantis and Kleinman have strengthened my suspicions, not lessened them.   They didn't even try to address any of the relevant information.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next up will be accusations of a "witch hunt."   Ironically we appear to be hunting actual witches (as they exist in the popular imagination and horror films, as opposed to benign Wicca types).   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm glad to see that posters are demanding that the suspects not be harassed.   Unfortunately there will invariably be a few overzealous and or/not-terribly-bright people who do exactly that.   It is even possible that counter-intelligence efforts are underway involving false flag harassment of innocent business owners.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another clever counter-intelligence effort I have noticed on r/conspiracy: the least credible information will be heavily upvoted until it gets to r/all.   The top post will be a debunking of said information.    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Case in point: there is a post on the front page about kids screaming in Comet Ping Pong.   Anyone who has been to a playground knows that kids constantly scream when they play.   I mean, it <em>could</em> be something sinister, but it hardly constitutes evidence.   Also, David Icke and reptillian aliens?   This shit sounds crazy enough as it is.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In contrast to that weak "evidence," there have been huge breakthroughs concerning <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dfiek/master_thread_pizzagate_needs_to_delve_more/">Luzzatto</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Luzzatto angle is by far the most incriminating evidence we have yet uncovered imo.  Even more so that Jimmy's Instagram and Podesta's artwork/Hastert link.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No need for embellishments.  I keep seeing people in compilation threads <em>starting</em> with false leads like the Comet ping pong logo.   Said logo does not resemble a butterfly and in fact is basically a variation of the <a href="http://tennis.sporting99.com/wimbledon/gifs/wimbledon-logo.jpg">Wimbledon</a> symbol.     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The food references are indeed strange but do not constitute substantive evidence.   Imo we should keep searching for pizza/food links but not use that info as a main talking point.   They should be referenced primarily to help people understand how the investigation was launched.   People should stop coming up with elaborate theories about handkerchiefs.   It's a waste of time.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are shills posting on this sub.   They all use the same talking points.   Easy way to spot a shill: they tie themselves into pretzels trying to explain away every aspect of Pizzagate.   References to "conspiracy theorists", "tinfoil" etc.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remain skeptical that the FBI is going to do its job, if for no other reason than this scandal could dramatically alter the entire power structure and create profound mistrust toward the ruling class.   However, assuming Trump isn't himself implicated in this stuff, he could use it to destroy his political enemies.    Pizza gate appears to involve the entire upper echelon of the Democratic Party and presumably much of the establishment Republican party as well.   Hollywood too.   I really hope Trump didn't strike a deal with Hillary to bury pizza gate in exchange for her not rigging the election.  Remember that during the primary with Bernie, some of the exit polls were off by a ridiculous 12 percent.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The more I think about Pizza gate the more it makes perverse sense.   If I were among those who ruled the world I would want politicians who were obedient.   I would want a politician who was heavily compromised so I wouldn't have to go through the messy business of assassinating him/her if they stepped out of line.   There is nothing more compromising than pedophilia.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You guys are doing God's work, and I say that as an atheist.    </p>
</li>
</ul></p>

        <p><p>Just to expand on a few of the points I made...</p>
<p><strong>Poor way of introducing this stuff to newbies</strong>: "We found a reference to a black-and-white handkerchief with a map that was 'pizza-related.'   We think they were referring to sadistic pedophilia and that Podesta left his semen on a handkerchief.   Also, we think 'pasta' refers to little boys even though we have zero proof." </p>
<p><strong>Good way of introducing this stuff to newbies.</strong>  "We found numerous strange food references in the emails that didn't make much sense.   The Podestas seem to be obsessed with pizza and pizza parties.  Here is some of Tony Pedosta's artwork.  One pizza place in particular kept coming up: Comet Ping Pong.  The owner of Comet Ping Pong is James Alefantis, ex-lover of David Brock (who ran Hillary's Super Pac Correct the Record).   Alefantis has inexplicably been described as the 49th most powerful man in Washington D.C.  Here is his instagram, which contains pictures of children and babies accompanied by sexual references.   </p>
<p><strong>Poor way of introducing this stuff to newbies</strong>: "Here is the logo for Comet Ping Pong: two ping pong rackets.  It looks vaguely like a butterfly though not really.   The butterfly is listed as a symbol for pedophilia according to the FBI."  </p>
<p><strong>Good way of introducing this stuff to newbies</strong>: "Here are various images posted by Comet Ping Pong: they contain explicit sexual imagery and often sexual imagery involving pizza and children.   This establishment is advertised as 'family friendly.'   We found that another pizza place two doors down has a "boy-lover" symbol for its logo, and that a business on the same block also linked to Hillary Clinton has a "girl-lover" symbol for its logo.   This may be a bizarre coincidence, but the 'coincidences' are becoming too numerous for us to ignore.   </p>
<p><strong>Poor way of introducing this stuff to newbies</strong>: "we believe that the upper echelons of the Democratic party and the elite in general are involved in a pedophilic satanic death cult.   It is probable that Hillary Clinton herself is a top witch in this cult, and has sacrificed and eaten newborn babies in occult rituals."  </p>
<p><strong>Good way of introducing this stuff to newbies</strong>: "We have found numerous references to the occult.   This is consistent with past pedophile scandals involving elites.   Here is a picture of a Temple on Jeffrey Epstein's island.  Epstein is a billionaire hedge fund manager and convicted pedophile.   He ran an international child trafficking ring but was given a slap on the wrist.   Florida police found hidden cameras throughout his Florida home, which strongly suggests that he is involved a honey pot operation (blackmail) for some intelligence agency.   Bill Clinton took two dozen flights on Epstein's private jet, nicknamed the 'lolita express.'   We are uncertain what the 'Satanic' or 'occult' angle implies.   Some elites may believe in the occult; occult ceremonies may be being used to create in-group bonding, like the 'Sull and Bones' fraternity at Yale, or the annual retreat at Bohemian Grove.   It is also possible that these rituals are used to traumatize children, and to make them look crazy if they ever come forward.   This is exactly what happened during the 'Franklin coverup' in Nebraska during the 1980's.   Here is a documentary on the scandal, 'Conspiracy of Silence.'  </p></p>

        <p><p>YES! This is really what we need to be focusing on, presenting it calm and reasonably.  It's all just so absurd that people are bound to believe it's made up at first, especially if  they see the whole "satanism" thing or just the fact that it's political. People will think it's just left over bitterness from the election.</p>
<p>This is all very real, and we need to present it as such, with as many facts as possible. No conjecture, guesses or code words. We have enough evidence now that we can nearly do that</p></p>

        <p><p>Look at reddit, they are pushing that me_irl subreddit to the front page this is so sick, that subreddit was actively trading children up until someone discovered it last week and now they are shoving our faces in it. That entire subreddit was scrubbed, before it had tons of posts openly trading children like this https://i.reddituploads.com/7174197bdeee43d2a244affc06c79277?fit=max&amp;h=1536&amp;w=1536&amp;s=5e9997c080e5ae0cb92f6988f1a501c4</p></p>

        <p><p>That was just the example I screenshotted, the top post there last week was a picture of a young child, had like 10000 upvotes and 1000 comments sexually fantasizing about it.</p></p>
