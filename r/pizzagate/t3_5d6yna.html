        <strong>Protip: Begin with the most damning and controversial evidence thus far when contacting media or sharing with others</strong>
        <p><p>Focus should be put on using the most damning evidence first when trying to spread the word. </p>
<p>In my opinion that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The image with the girl's hands taped to the table</li>
<li>Besta Pizza using pedophiliac symbols in their logo, only to change it after the investigation began</li>
<li>The entertainment and interior design of Comet Ping Pong. </li>
</ul>
<p>There may be more to this list, but it would be nearly impossible for a rational adult to not be seriously disturbed after seeing that picture or the other things listed. Proving why this should be pursued within the first 10 seconds is absolutely essential.</p></p>

        <p><p>That these people could get the nation's eyes on them if they spoke out but haven't.Almost 9,000 people accusing you of horrific crimes and you refuse to present evidence to the contrary in the public eye its not unreasonable that people draw the conclusion that, for whatever reason, you don't want the attention. That this is safer for you than speaking out.</p></p>
