        <strong>Comet Ping Pong, Besta Pizza, and the Psychiatric Institute of Washington. The Rabbit Hole Goes Even Deeper!</strong>
        <p><p>A based chan anon pointed out that the Psychiatric Institute of Washington is only 5 minutes away from Comet. It’s 1 of 6 psychiatric institutions in America that treat ritual abuse and dissociative disorders. </p>
<p>http://psychinstitute.com/</p>
<p>It may currently be ran by Dr. Howard Hoffman whose “clinical interests include the treatment of couples with sexual dysfunctions”. </p>
<p>https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=dl_tBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR9&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;dq=dr.+howard+hoffman+psychiatrist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QpQb9KqbdI&amp;sig=1ItF2wYEMzrNeqK-RlgVRBJKOls&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ2tGvpbDQAhUKi7wKHeooAgY4ChDoAQgeMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=dr.%20howard%20hoffman%20psychiatrist&amp;f=false</p>
<p>Located within is The Center. </p>
<p>http://thecenteratpiw.com/about-the-center/</p>
<p>The heads are Joan Turkus, MD (an expert in dissociative disorders) and Christine Cortois, Phd, author of Healing the Incest Wound and Recollections of Sexual Abuse.”</p>
<p>From the site: </p>
<p>“OUR FOUNDERS </p>
<p>Joan A. Turkus, MD Dr. Turkus has extensive clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of posttraumatic conditions and dissociative disorders in inpatient and outpatient settings, in both the private and public sectors. Dr. Turkus frequently provides supervision, consultation, and teaching for therapists locally and nationally. She maintains a private practice in general and forensic psychiatry in Falls Church, Virginia. Dr. Turkus has authored or co-authored several articles and book chapters on posttraumatic and dissociative disorders and has developed expertise in the psychopharmacological management of complex posttraumatic conditions. </p>
<p>Christine A.Courtois, Ph.D. Dr. Courtois is also a psychologist in private practice in Washington, DC. Dr. Courtois has received numerous professional awards including the 1996 American Psychological Association Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology as a Professional Practice. She has authored three books, Recollections of Sexual Abuse: Treatment Principles and Guidelines (1999), Adult Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse: A Workshop Model (1993), and Healing the Incest Wound: Adult Survivors in Therapy (1988), in addition to numerous articles and chapters on related topics. Dr. Courtois conducts professional training locally, nationally, and internationally and is a member of the Board of Directors of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies. "</p>
<p>Turkus was John Hinckley Jr.’s psychiatrist at St. Elizabeths Hospital.</p>
<p>https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1984/10/04/hinckleys-clinical-condition-improving-psychiatrists-say/fe13db9b-a836-4890-bc42-66ae1c6db47b/</p>
<p>http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-25/news/8601220230_1_hinckley-st-elizabeths-hospital-mental-illness</p>
<p>Here is where conspiracies collide. </p>
<p>I quote:</p>
<p>“St. Elizabeth’s Mental Hospital had been a covert MK ULTRA institution for decades”</p>
<p>https://mindcontrolblackassassins.com/tag/office-of-strategic-services/ </p>
<p>“The primary goals of the MKUltra experiments were to test the effects of drugs, namely hallucinogens, and other forms of psychotherapy – including electroshock therapy – on humans, and to research and perfect methods of torture which could best be used to create Manchurian candidates, or mind-controlled persons, who could be programmed to carry out any number of harmful acts, up to and including assassinating presidents of the United States…”</p>
<p>http://www.infowars.com/new-dhs-headquarters-was-an-mkultra-test-facility/</p>
<p>It was one of 80 institutions. Georgetown University Hospital was another:</p>
<p>“The involvement with Georgetown University Hospital, which served many of Washington's most powerful figures and treated the son of the Senate Health subcommittee chairman, Edward M. Kennedy, for cancer, was the most illustrative of how the C.I.A. operated. The agency was seeking an institution where its own personnel could test a wide range of drugs including a “knockout pill.”</p>
<p>http://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/04/archives/80-institutions-used-in-cia-mind-studies-admiral-turner-tells.html</p>
<p>Dr. Turkus graduated from Georgetown University Hospital. </p>
<p>http://health.usnews.com/doctors/joan-turkus-47316</p>
<p>She was also there during the 60’s and apparently went by Joan Sheets after marrying Jim Sheets:</p>
<p>http://www.potomacvalleysams.com/Rememblog.html</p>
<p>More proof she is Joan Sheets:</p>
<p>http://www.ljubimci-forum.com/index.php?topic=37543.5;wap2</p>
<p>I made the connection after reading this post about Cathy O’brien:
https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5deqjr/firsthand_account_of_what_hillary_clinton_did_to/:</p>
<p>The book is MKULTRA and Trance Formation of America By Cathy O'Brien with Mark Phillips: </p>
<p>http://static.everdot.org/ebooks/english/Cathy_OBrien__Mark_Philips_-<em>Trance_Formation_of_America_MKULTRA</em>-_1995.pdf</p>
<p>Strange no?</p>
<p>To make it even stranger check out this address:
3920 W St., N.W Washington D.C. </p>
<p>It’s 10 minutes away from Comet and it’s also one of the supposed locations of the Finder’s cult.</p>
<p>“Upon contacting Detective Bradley, I learned that he had initiated an investigation on the two addresses provided by the Tallahassee Police Dept. during December of 1986. An informant had given him information regarding a cult, known as the "Finders" operating various businesses out of a warehouse located at 1307 4th St., N.E., and were supposed to be housing children at 3918/3920 W St., N.W.”</p>
<p>https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Document:Finders_Keepers</p>
<p>“The information was specific in describing "blood rituals" and sexual orgies involving children, and an as yet unsolved murder in which the Finders might be involved.”</p>
<p>http://educate-yourself.org/cn/ciadrugsabusemurder.shtml</p>
<p>It wouldn’t surprise me if after all of this we learn that Reptilians are behind 7th floor group, Big Foot is real, and Tupac is actually alive in Cuba.</p></p>

<p>Add: Dr Warren Klam to the mix - he was the head Dr there in the 80's and 90's - he's the brother of the actor who played "Guido Sarducci" on SNL.</p>
<p>Also, note the reference to Tallahassee.  Tallahassee is not too far from Marianna, FL - home of Florida School for Boys aka Dozier School for Boys.  Do a quick read if you wanna know why this is significant.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is a big lead. I can't even keep up anymore. </p>
<p>I'm sure glad I don't live anywhere near Connecticut avenue. This place is fucking scary.</p></p>

        <p><p>I stand corrected.  It was Dr. Joseph "Joe" Novello, who is the brother of Don Novello (Guido Sarduci).  Joe Novello's wife was the Surgeon General.</p>
<p>Point being out of all of this is there is an awful lot of "nepotism" going on here.  And all in close proximity.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Also, on all the info i can find for Klam, it's obvious he spent plenty of time in the DC region, but no work citations.  Trying to find a connection between him and Gottlieb.</p></p>

        <p><p>I have no doubt that there is a full Belief system is in place to groom the Children, but at this point the odds of an Intelligence test to make dissociated (triggerable) Children to use as Phsyco Agents. If dissociated when young there is still enough adaptablity to turn it into a mental advantage. Similar to desensitization, used on Soldiers.Remember: "Empowerment" is the secret ingredient, at Comic Ping Pong</p></p>

        <p><p>This wouldn't surprise me at all, the same persons who benefit from drug addiction are the same persons who profit every time someone checks into rehab; classic Rothschild hedge betting, "heads I win, tails you lose" philosophy.</p></p>
