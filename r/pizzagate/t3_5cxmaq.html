        <p><p>It is also on Youtube but the original version was censored so I don't even know if the ones up currently have everything.  IT IS BANNED IN THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE BECAUSE IT HAS 100% PROOF WITH PHONE CALLS, PEOPLE GETTING LOCKED UP, WHISTLEBLOWERS ETC.   HOLLYWOOD IS RAN BY PEDOPHILES.</p></p>

<p>not banned. Pretty sure they had a defamation suit and it was settled so that parts would be excluded.</p></p>

        <p><p>People in the USA can not watch it on Youtube.  That is censorship.  The lawsuits are a bunch of bullshit.  The pedophiles and judges are all connected in hollywood hence why these sick fucks got such light sentences.</p></p>

        <p><p>This was posted a few days ago via Youtube link and people in the USA could not watch it.  The point I am trying to make is they are trying to prevent people in the USA from watching it for good reason.</p></p>

        <p><p>Along with this documentary, I would also recommend the following two: Witch Hunt, and Capturing the Friedmans. The first is actually an expose of the bogus charges filed against people in what was known as the "day care sex abuse hysteria" of the 1980s. Very clear evidence of sloppy detective work pushed by ruthless government officials that ultimately resulted in the imprisonment of numerous innocent people for many years.</p>
<p>The second is a quite interesting sort of expose on a more clear-cut case of child abuse that, once again, blew up into far more grandiose charges than any evidence seemed to show. Nonetheless, it helps in terms of analyzing people who have actually engaged in this conduct and how they respond.</p></p>
