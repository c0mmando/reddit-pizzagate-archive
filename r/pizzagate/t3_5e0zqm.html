        <strong>Why was the first wethepizza guy's post removed?</strong>
        <p><p>I'm just wondering why it was removed. It's weird they removed his post but not the we the pizza guy #2. 
Could the 2nd guy be trolling to distract us from the 1st post? </p>

        <p><p>IIRC, the post wasn't linking to CP but in his comments it was. Why didn't they just removed the comment linking to CP instead of removing the actual post?  </p></p>

        <p><p>~~&gt; Could the 2nd guy be trolling to distract us from the 1st post?~~</p>
<p>~~I think this is a subtle point that's been totally overlooked throughout this whole ordeal.~~</p>
<p>I think we need to clear the air and start collecting the facts about this:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/iHaveDamningEvidence">OP1</a> posted a thread with the claim that he obtained <strong>2GB's</strong> worth of incriminating data from <a href="https://archive.is/f0POR">WeThePizza.com</a>'s server.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dzxtw/holy_mother_of_god_guy_who_claimed_to_find_2gb_of/da8kvj6/">his post</a>, OP1 suggested he would only stick around for a maximum of 30 minutes to talk about what he had found</li>
<li>During that time, OP1 posted a link to an archive of legitimate cp. But no documents to conclusively prove that he obtained them from WeThePizza.</li>
<li>The hosted cp archive was deleted after a relatively brief period of time.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dykv3/i_have_cracked_into_an_unidentified_pizza/da8bu0h/">This</a> was OP1's last comment, only <strong>1 hour</strong> after his initial post.</li>
<li><strong>4 hours later</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wethepizza_the2ndGuy">OP2</a> made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dzwji/hi_i_am_the_guy_guy_2_that_hacked_wethepizzacom/">his post</a>. In it he complains about OP1's conduct, yet seems to be actively creating a lot more of a commotion than OP1 did.</li>
<li>OP2 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e0i3m/here_is_the_encrypted_client_list_for_we_the/da8poip/">claims to have cloned WeThePizza's hard drives</a> in addition to the 2GB of cp. OP1 never mentioned this.</li>
<li>OP2 mentioned that the client data he had was encrypted. OP1 never mentioned anything being encrypted.</li>
<li>OP2 said that he stole <strong>the software</strong> WeThePizza used to keep track of their clients, not just the client data itself.</li>
<li>OP2 posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e0njl/monthly_client_listexe_is_leaking_the_private_key/">the PGP <strong>public key</strong> to a Windows executable file (.exe)</a> that supposedly contains the client data (presumably the executable for the software he claims to have stolen)</li>
<li>OP2 has posted no <strong>private keys</strong> to verify the original PGP keys with, nor any actual files (encrypted or otherwise) to go along with them.</li>
<li>EDIT: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e189p/what_kind_of_evidence_do_you_guys_need_from_us/">OP1 now confirms</a> he's working with OP2 and backs his claims</li>
