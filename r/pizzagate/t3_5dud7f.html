<p><p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: This is a SAFE imagehoster! Uploaded the map again, but it expires again in 1 hour!
Save and upload the map to imgur and/or sli.mg and post the link here! Im using TOR could not manage that quickly. Check all profiles, upload to archive.is and make screenshots of suspicious images, before they delete!</p>
<hr/>
<p>I found a new connection between <em>pandaheadmag.com</em> , Alefantis and Amanda Kleinman.
Alefantis is a supporter of pandamag. His name can be seen there (not clear if he is donor)
Looking around i found this picture showing <strong>"pizzaparty“ on a letter and a "white rabbit"</strong>: https://www.pandaheadmag.com/issues/two/0_intro/main/index.html
Two persons are involved in making this image.</p>
<hr/>
<p>First one is <strong>Erik Loften</strong>. He is Motion Graphic Designer and works currently as broadcaster designer at msnbc news. <a href="https://facebook.com/eloften">Facebook</a> . He liked Comet Ping Pong and a site called brightestyoungthings.com (seems that some persons of pandaheadmag work there too). Something like a gay magazine. Checking his vimeo chanel i saw videos of him and his girlfriend/wife. So not clear if he is gay/bi  or has other connection to this mag. Making a whois i find out that the person(s) behind pandamag don't want to be known. They anonymize their registry data.
There are two interesting videos made by him full of symbology (<em>pizza, hotdogs;very political</em>) which you should check out.
Monster reel video 2013: https://vimeo.com/81215335 . Starts with a <em>giant pizza</em>
Monster reel video 2016: https://vimeo.com/166421528</p>
<hr/>
<p>The other guy is <strong>Christopher Chen</strong>. He works or is owner of a place called flurcafe. He is friends with Amanda Kleinman on flickr. </p>
<hr/>
<p>Then i went on checking <strong>Amanda Kleinmans flickr account</strong>: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/kleiny41/">Flickr</a> Found some suspicious accounts there.
First is <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/bloodypowers">Flickr</a>
There are a bunch of photos of her with members of different bands. On the first page you can see a band named „Man forever“ using a logo whick looks very like the FBI pedo logo. Check it up guys. Another image shows a shop called „Big Daddys Porn Shop“. She is from Pittsburgh, perhaps  the shop is situated there too. Someone check this up. There are some pictures showing her with a satanastic band too.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The following guy follows A.K. and is followed by her: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/andyjay/">Flickr</a>
<strong>Andrew Hawkins</strong> lives in NYC and works for the verge magazine as transportation reporter. There are videos and pictures showing him in the underground of ny and on some conference where you can see underground plans beeing discussed.
The photos on the first page are lets say not so normal, i don't know, is it normal to make and post publicly photos of his own naked baby?
The question here is: Why is he somehow connected with A.K.? 
Should mention too that Mr Hawkins follows some strange people like: Dawn Manees Grzesik :flickr.com/photos/damghotthang1 which is at the same time: flickr.com/people/hugznluv1 . This person has strange profiles and gives some additionally contact infos to yahoo, youtube and snapfish accounts. The thumbnails on youtube indicate that there is gore, but can't view them. Somebody should check all the profiles. There are much other shit profiles in his list.</p>
<hr/>
<p>There is something else. A.K. has a follower named <strong>Alex Vidales</strong>. He only follows her and has no other follower. His account was set up in 2015, but his only 6 photos were posted in February 2016. These photos show a church and medical center. I could get any further infos out of them.
Profile: <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/135513384@N08/">Flickr</a></p>
<hr/>
<p>And not to forget <strong>John Sonderman</strong>: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnsonderman">Flickr</a>
This guy had contacts to the white house. Visited it 6 times in 2009 (check log list). He catched a photo of EXACTLY the PEDO FBI LOGO. Its on a giant dragons head. He made several photos of this thing and named them „catharsis on the mall“. Somebody check up what this thing dragon thing is. Seems there is a bus underneath. And check this symbols under the tent!
He uses a panda as profile image. Im sure i have seen somewhere that something about a pandamask was mentioned. He is member of the Group „DCExposed“.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 1</strong>: Remember that we are only looking for new valid connections. Everybody in this pizzagate case and everybody who is connected to them is innocent until proven different.</p>
<p><strong>Further infos (James Huckenpahler and Team-Sasha-Lord) on the map!</strong></p></p>
