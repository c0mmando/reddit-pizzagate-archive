    Wiki leaks emails and Podesta emails talk about code words like "hot dogs and pizza" and dominoes and shit like that but they use the words completely out of context it's so obvious it's code for something. Use the Reddit search function and just go through some old post inbhere.

     Is the NY Post giving cryptic "Pizza" messages?? Seems odd to me.

       The fact that a company uses a spiral in its logo isn't proof of anything.

         I have seen all of this. There is absolutely no proof whatsoever. What you presented isn't proof - it's random weak connections.

         The only reason this whole conspiracy makes sense in your eyes is because you've already made up your mind about what is the truth.

          Well for starters you're wrong because it doesn't make sense in my eyes what so ever. 
What I do know is that it is very very fucking weird and there's way too many connections to call anything a coincidence.

           I've spent the past 5 days reading every single thing that has been posted. I still disagree that this adds up to compelling evidence. No one wants to hear that, for some reason.

             There are too many giant leaps. I am curious about the Podestas--mind you, curious only. It's still just "this could be a code!" Maybe it is. Maybe it's not a code at all. Maybe it's a code for something else. No one here will explore or acknowledge those possibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
             After that, the leap from the Podestas to Comet is akin to "he has weird art and shows kids on his instagram!" Especially when those kids have been proven to be the kids of his good friends/business partners.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, no.

          And I'm not just going to rule it out as conspiracy because it's too hard to believe... that's what idiots do, listen to others without doing their own due diligence.

          There is more evidence to explain that there is a pedo ring or some sort of fuckery going on than there is evidence to definitively say that there is not.

        There is no evidence if you don't read anything. It's all been gathered and organized. Click the link in the sidebar.

        If you won't bother reading anything then of course you'll be unconvinced. We all realize how insane it all sounds. But we can't explain the evidence any other way.

        I'd love for any of these people doing these extremely suggestive things to somehow explain themselves. Oh wait, all they've been doing is playing catch up by selectively editing and deleting their social media shit and changing the pizza joint's logo. This shit is creepy and strange at best. But either way, all of these connections certainly warrant investigation. We want an explanation. But if they even acknowledge anything, they know it's over for them. Think about it. Don't dismiss what may just seem crazy and look at facts with an open mind.
