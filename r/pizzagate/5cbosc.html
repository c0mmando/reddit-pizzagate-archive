    I dont mean this in a condescending way, but you guys are young, arent you? I remember when this happened.
   </p>
   <p>
    I guess it's a good idea for us older folks (I assume there are others here) to remember that there are probably a lot of younger or newer members here who are unaware of Aquino &amp; the Mc Martin preschool scandal, the Franklin coverup, etc.
   </p>
   <p>
    It's really refreshing to see the younger delving into  this subject matter with new sets of eyes. It is
    <em>
     hands down
    </em>
    <strong>
     the hardest subject matter
    </strong>
    you will ever look at. 99.8% of the population can't or won't. And that is exactly why things like this go on and stay hidden in the shadows for generations. It's just too damn difficult and disturbing to thnk about.
   </p>
   <p>
    I commend each and every one of you for being here, for being willing to look &amp; investigate. You have my utmost respect.

     The McMartin case in particular was not real.  Read the wikipedia article about it and it becomes obvious.  People like retired FBI chief Ted Gunderson and other shills are spreading this story to try to lead us astray so we'll look like wild-eye crazies. There are real cases like the Dutroux affair in Belgium, Saville in England, and so on.  The so-called "Franklin coverup" also appears to be disinformation.  The grand jury actually indicted the accusers for perjury.

    When you look into the backgrounds of the founders of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, which was set up to disprove allegations of child abuse, it all starts to look very suspicious.
   </p>
   <p>
    These people had a vested interest in casting doubt on children who claimed to have been abused. Several had been accused themselves. One even did an interview with a pro pedophile magazine indicating that he believed children and adults could have consensual relationships.
   </p>
   <p>
    I read that one or more of the kids involved in the McMartin case had an Std so if that's true obviously there was abuse somewhere. Whether it was on the scale it was claimed or took place in the school I'm not sure. There certainly seems to have been an element of hysteria there.
   </p>
   <p>
    Probably a discussion for a different subreddit though :)

     A child had an std? This makes me sad. Not only do they live with emotional scars, they have to live with whatever std keeps coming back to haunt them

     My immediate reaction when I read that in Wikipedia was to laugh.  It isn't impossible though and that is what is troubling.  These accusations need to be investigated but people's lives cannot be ruined over false accusations either.  It is a really trying endeavor.

      Because there is no such thing as a repressed memory. It makes not evolutionary sense. The whole idea is Freudian nonsense.
     </p>
     <p>
      And you would be shocked to learn how malleable memory is. It's easy as fuck to plant a false memory. That goes doubly for children. I minored in behavioral neuroscience. This required some classes in psychological pathology and human memory and learning.
     </p>
     <p>
      Trust me. Research debunking repressed memory is robust.
     </p>
     <p>
      I know people who have been fucked by psychologists who saw satanic ritual abuse everywhere they looked. The shit is fucked. There are also parents from broken homes who plant memories of abuse in their own children so they no longer have to deal with them.

    What else? I've spent so many months of my life just absorbing information, I thought I was pretty informed. Now I'm flying down a rabbit hole I just discovered.
   </p>
   <p>
    And yeah, a lot of us are probably young. Growing up on the internet does give a different perspective and analysis, old and young help to complete the puzzle.

    JESUS guys. I'm saying look into this. Hundreds of cases and all of them are just thrown out saying "oh well, must be just false memories".
   </p>
   <p>
    It's easier for the public to believe that hundreds of kids had the same false memories than then being actually correct. scary.

    i hear that they went to dig tunnels, and they purposely dug in the wrong areas. Sonar confirmed tunnels actually existed near this.

    Easy easy everyone. There is a lot of evidence that shows the Mcmartin case is bullshit. Please read and research all sides! But before you downvote the shit out of this, remember, it could be a "false flag" type of thing to cover up/discredit the real thing!

     The case was started by one crazy lady, and these
     <em>
      toddlers
     </em>
     were asked leading questions, so of course they made up stories to give the interviewers what they seemed to want.  Read the wiki.  They claimed to have been flushed down toilets, to have see witches fly, ride in hot air balloons, etc.  This looks like an
     <em>
      actual
     </em>
     case of false "memories."

        /u/EagleGod is right.  Read the wikipedia article about the McMartin case.  The lady made the accusations based on her son having had disrupted bowel movements.  The interviewers asked the kids leading questions, and the toddlers made up stories like being flushed down toilets and riding in hot air balloons.  Read the wiki.  This was a real case of false memories, and people like retired FBI chief Ted Gunderson and other shills are spreading this story to try to discredit us.  There are real cases like the Dutroux affair in Belgium, Saville in England, and so on.

          What are you basing that on?  Wikipedia is crowd-sourced.  I mean, shills could go on there and edit things, but so can people pushing from the other end.  It's moderated and everything has to be sourced.  The proceedings of a court case are a matter of public record, so it's not like they can just make it up and it would stay on wikipedia.

            Well, you have a point there, but the difference with 9/11 and JFK is we know of evidence contradicting the official story.  We have no evidence to support the McMartin case, and all that I've read on it seems to show the accusations were false.  Feel free to dig and find something on it, but for now, I think it's disinfo.

            I'm not a shill.  Read my post history.  You shouldn't go accusing someone of being a shill unless they try to dispute
            <em>
             obvious
            </em>
            evidence or have shown a pattern of posting bad evidence (disinformation).

    this is actually true, though.

   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Transcripts and recordings of the interviews contained far more speech from adults than children and demonstrated that, despite the highly coercive interviewing techniques used, initially the children were resistant to interviewers' attempts to elicit disclosures.
