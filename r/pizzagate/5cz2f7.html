      Search ALL the Podesta e-mails, and sort by creation date. You will notice a huge gap before the 4th.

    This is a great tactic.
   </p>
   <p>
    Write a personal blog. Suddenly, there are four. Always better if they have a clear and concise infographic.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then share these four with the infographic to fringe websites with a little more reputation. Hope they go with it. If so, share everywhere.
   </p>
   <p>
    Keep the pressure and public sharing going and hopefully it hits the mainstream.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nice going.

    The sketches are of a single person: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/madeleine-mccann-latest-are-police-any-closer-to-knowing-the-tru/
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Mary and Martin Smith, from Ireland, told police they saw a man carrying a child matching Madeleine’s description at around 10pm on Rua da Escola Primaria, 500 yards from the McCanns’ apartment. He was heading towards the beach, did not look like a tourist and did not seem comfortable carrying the child, they said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their evidence was compelling, but it was only in October 2013 that two e-fit images of the man, compiled by police from descriptions given by Mr and Mrs Smith, were released by Scotland Yard to coincide with a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction of Madeleine’s disappearance. He remains a suspect.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    edit: Don't downvote. Provide evidence that I'm wrong, but don't downvote the truth just because it doesn't validate your fantasies about an easy lead.

     I read this, but then someone said that they'd been seen at different times, or something along those lines. Can someone clarify?

    So what's the link between the Podestas and Portugal? Like where did they enjoy vacationing to inside of Portugal? Who did they know there?
   </p>
   <p>
    It's not just a coincidence that they enjoy vacationing there people! What person or persons do they know there?

     Two leads I am aware of are
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <p>
       Tony and John Podesta operated the Podesta Group during this time frame. Tony still runs that business today which is a very profitable political consulting firm. John's involved tapered off once he became part of Obama's transition team in 2008. According to FEC filings one of the customers of the Podesta Group (to the tune of over $600,000) for that calender year was Tyco Electronics/Connectivity which has three commercial addresses in Portugal within a 3 hour drive of where McCann went missing.
      </p>
     </li>

      <p>
       The
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161115030608/http://www.hotelnewsresource.com/article23106.html">
        WTTC Summit 2007
       </a>
       , which was held in Protugal of that year. The venue for that event also is a 3 hour drive from where McCann went missing. The entity that sponsors that summit and participates in it is the Trilateral Commission, of which John Podesta is a member (though I can't figure out what year he joined it). That summit was scheduled for May 10 to May 12 2007 and Podesta may have helped plan that event in advance of its scheduled date, but we cannot find anything to confirm this.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     With or without the above information we need some more information that shows that one or both of them traveled to Portgual within the first week of May 2007.
    </p>
    <p>
     John Podesta was back in DC by May 11th 2007 and was recorded in a committee hearing as well as being photographed outside of the PAC he worked for.

      And if it were possible, the number of seats booked under his reservation on flights out.  Though, having thought about this for a little bit... he likely would have driven her to Spain, or farther, before ever risking putting her on a plane out.  Girl likely crying, and also splashed on every television in the country.  Best case would be finding flight manifest with him even in Europe, but also, assuming he was, when he left and out of which country.   My guess is MM never made it on a plane and was trafficked through rural areas with the assistance of women (better concealment) and - assuming Podestas involvement- he'd have distanced himself from her once capture and transition to handler was complete.

       Given his likely financial resources (and those of his brother) it would make more sense that they took a private flight.

    Only John Podesta really matches.
   </p>
   <p>
    I don't think the other photograph is Tony Podesta. I think it's Eric Knaus a.k.a. the Great Zucchini - a D.C. 'children entertainer' who has performed in the White House, is a frequent visitor to Comet Pizza, a friend of Alefantis and the one sitting to the right of Podesta in the photograph with the 'card game'.
   </p>
   <p>
    Which is key.
