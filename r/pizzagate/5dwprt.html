      Use this tag! It's attention grabbing. If I didn't know what pizzagate was I'd never think twice about it if I saw it in passing. But pedogate? Everybody will know exactly what's going on from a single hashtag.

     Quick question. Is this another satellite sub for The_Donald? Do you guys actively ban and censor disagreement just as much?
    </p>
    <p>
     It seems like the type of place where you'll get brigaded with downvotes just for asking questions.

      T_D is censored like that becuase the purpose of the sub is to be only for Trump support. There is r/asktrumpsupporters for discussions, questions, and yes, even dissent.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is a large crossover audience and just about everyone here is a Trump supporter. But we are here for a very specific reason. We are all very wary of outsiders gaining entry to the sub to derail it and slide important information, to the point where they've removed mods just becuase they were unsure of their motives. We can not be subverted.
     </p>
     <p>
      I've posted logical, normal explanations to things here that people proposed to be something fishy, and I wasn't banned or downvoted. People responded positively to my skepticism. Posters here appreciate Occam's razor. Red herrings are a possibility in researching this, and we don't to waste time on dead ends while children are being abused. As long you are respectful of the reason why we're all here (there is good reason to consider all details around pizzagate to be suspicious), offering common sense explanations or being critical of theories won't get you thrown out or shut down. But dismissively saying "Nothing to see here, move along lads" definetley will.
     </p>
     <p>
      We are all here to expose this and stop this, period. We can't waste time with either concern trolls or red herrings. You can point out the latter without being the former.

       There is no evidence for that.   I'm not a Trump supporter.   Many posters here aren't even American.   Claiming this is a strictly partisan affair is not only wrong but will drive people away.

        The investigation started on 4chan, was posted to The_Donald and then a member of The_Donald created /pizzagate because it was taking over The_Donald message boards. So, this sub started with a whole bunch of Trump supporters and now has gained many more followers. So, yes, there is no proof that the majority of the subscribers here are Trump supporters but I think that is why the poster said that.

       Yo i am in no way a Trump supporter. I voted Johnson. But I've been involved in this for weeks now. I think it was popularized from T_D but I don't think we're all autists.

        I know there's plenty of you aren't. From my perspective this sub was created because it kept blowing up in the_donald and needed it's own sub. I'm glad we have all kinds of people here.

         I actually discovered this from a FB share, it's exploding onto other social media platforms as well.

       AskTrumSupporters censors and bans almost as much.
      </p>
      <p>
       And uncensorednews, ironically enough, does it even more. Even wikileaks has gone on a full censorship tirade ever since their recent mod change.

       I've already seen several people mention inconsistencies in the conspiracy theory and be called "CTR" or a "shill" or a "troll." It seems anybody who disagrees in any way is labeled as such. Which would make sense for one of T_D's satellite subs.

         Others had different user names and were still labeled CTR trolls for questioning the narrative or providing opposite evidence.

        <p>
         And yes, I'm one person. So unless you think I have thousands of alts and that I control every single person who disagrees with the narrative, you should consider that maybe, just maybe not everyone who disagrees with The_Donald conspiracy theories is a "troll."

       Just don't be naive and think they don't have some serious blackmail-worthy shit on Trump too. Sibel Edmonds knows what's up, the Deep State has shit on everyone and you need to be dirty to get put in any major office (see: the fix on Bernie).

        I've heard that Epstein had secret recording equipment all around his properties that he used to gather blackmail on his guests for performing sexual acts with minors. If true, I still wouldn't expect it to ever reach the public, but boy would that 'out' a LOT of important people.

        Yep, I know there are lots of you who aren't. In the 12 short days this has been a sub it has grown to have a broader audience, but all I saw was that this sub was created because the posts kept blowing up on the_Donald. Just my perspective but now I see people coming here from all over, Facebook etc. It was mostly 4chan/t_d subscribers in the beginning (less than 2 weeks ago) so my comment wasn't based on nothing, but now I see the broader reach. And that's a good thing, we need all kinds of people here.

      Considering some of the people implicated in the scandal are people that Donald Trump has considered appointing, it would be pretty funny if they thought this was some kind of pro-Trump scandal

      not sure what youre talking about but no, not aware of any pro Trump subs. all the specialised things like Wiki, Soros &amp; child stuff are in their own subs now.

        you are either onboard with this after having seen the research or you are not. not wasting any more time on you and putting you on ignore list. too many people trying to derail the conversation.

        No we are not all Trump supporters. Plenty of other people here, Johnson, Jill, Bernie. Even saw one or two HRC supporters that became interested. Personally I am a Berner and most friends/family I know are engaged in researching this. They are definitely not all Trump supporters.

      No, we have people here from all over the internet and are not all Trump supporters. We have even had info posted on Trump before. I've personally done my best to spread this to the Bernie community, haven't had any issue w/censorship

      Look at the posts, all of them in the same format as the trumpets, lots of words in all caps, things like "100% indisputable TRUTH" followed by a meme that is easily debunked, constant name calling of "shill" or "ctr" even if some of the people don't think it's a trump sub, it is.

       And now I get why hardcore BLM supporters get pissed off. I think they approached it all wrong, but it does distract from the issues to say ALM.

        except Police Brutality affects people of all races and popularizing BLM only services to create racial division and tension.

        here we are focusing on something specific.

        in either case...this is not the subject being debated at hand. you can post alllivesmatter if you want. its not something im arguing about.

        Such as the issue of BLM being funded and created by an old Jewish billionaire named George Soros who helped confiscate belongings from other Jews in Nazi Germany?

      Omg, why would a pizza place have a walk in freezer? Must be for pedophilia! This is a pretty thin theory... also, they are willing to believe that obama flew in children to fuck at a white house event, but not break the rules on outside food? Who are these nutters? Also, waitresses was likely in quotations because they were probably banging hot and more like models than food servers.

      Edit: lol just realized i wandered into this sub from /r/all, sorry for disrespecting your space but based on that graphic your theory is fucking stupid.

      It also uses 4chan posts... Christ.

      Last edit: why am I being upvoted and by who? I expected to get cornholed with down votes and hate after I realized my mistake. Also the arguments are surprisingly cordial minus a couple guys.

         See that's where your wrong. Multiple convicted offenders being connected to this group, that's more than coincidence, no?

          What group and what convicted sex offenders? Do me a favor, actually look up the sex offenders in your area. There are likely thousands. If you own, operate a business a sex offender is likely frequenting it. You have probably interacted with a sex offender without even realizing.

           Ya and maybe even a murderer too (SCARY I know)! Get over yourself everyone understands there are messed up people doing bad things sprinkled throughout society, that's not a surprise at all to anyone.
          </p>
          <p>
           I really doubt you would spend the time to actually read all the posts your self, since you seem to shut down ideas that seem a little bit of a reach to you. I digress, the point is HOW they are connected and WHO all these people are. They aren't nobody's.

            I read the sidebar posts, they are a lot of vague information, and coincidence being interpreted by someone who doesn't seem to have left the basement in a while. The amount that all this relies on a very weird interpretation of innocuous stuff should concern you. It's all also demonstrates a very poor understanding of how sex offenders, traffickers, as well as normal people function. Point out one thing that doesn't have a reasonable explanation?

             Sidebar posts won't explain to you well enough the information most of us have ingested and digested over the past month.
            </p>
            <p>
             Look into the Franklin cover up. Look into the Hampstead children. Look into Cathy O'Brien. Look into Kim Noble and Rhea Pratt. Look into Jimmy Savile. Look into Laura Silsby and the Clinton Foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
             The list goes on. Please don't be so dismissive without being informed.

             It is vague for sure. People cover their tracks and want to flaunt but not to get caught.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's the cumulative effect when you factor it all in. Like a court getting a statement on a person's demeanor but for the whole group. It looks really, really, bad. The jimmycomet Instagram account was creepy as hell I know that's not evidence enough for jail but it's something for sure. The undertones of the posts and comments are surreal.  The in appropriate art on the walls in comet. Depicting kids being abused, on top of a handkerchief. That connects to the emails as well.

            then why not update the infographic into a coherent narrative that actually explains your positions, because as it is, it reads like a bunch of disjointed nonsense. telling someone to read "all the threads" is about as useful as handing dolan trump a science textbook and telling him to read it.

            I find this theory intriguing and I subbed so I wouldn't miss any of the serious details or a smoking gun, but so far I'm only mildly amused

           If you bothered to look it up, you would find that John Podesta is close friends with three
           <em>
            convicted
           </em>
           sex offenders (one of them raped his 3 year old daughter for example). He also has plenty of artwork in his house depicting pedophilic imagery and relating to serial killers that were known pedophiles.

            I keep hearing this. 
Who are talking about other than Hastert? What evidence is there that these are close friends rather than just loose aquaintances in the circles of the powerful? And who raped whose daughter?

           <p>
            I am disregarding the "smoking gun" of the artworks. Modern art is always trying to be shocking. Just because you find it distasteful proves nothing at all.

           Well here in rural America we do look up who's sex offenders and totally outcast them sooo, sorry if you're in a big city that can't keep up with the amount of sex offenders in your area but we do here and we punish them and push them out of our society.

           Dude Laura Silsby, caught trying to take 33 kids out of haiti, gets off by the clintons when bill become president. Her lawyer was also a convicted sex offender. NOW she works for the company in charge of Amber Alert. She changed her last name to Gayler.

          If you live in a city, your food establishment is probably frequented by rapists, drug dealers, murderers, etc. It doesn't mean anything about your establishment other than they are people and as such they like food. It doesn't mean your dominoes is part of a giant drug ring if dealers eat there.
         </p>
         <p>
          Every piece of evidence presented that I've seen has logical other option for what it could mean. I mean it's not that surprising that a pizza place uses a pizza shaped logo or talks about pizza even if those things are related to child abuse in certain circles it is far from proving a pizza place is involved in it.
         </p>
         <p>
          Should this be investigated? Sure. Even if there are logical arguments against the evidence, there is still a possibility that it could be something else and should be looked into deeper, but nothing presented is actual hard evidence at this point, and it is pretty thin tbh. I'm all for police doing due diligence though.

           Hit the nail on the head. I'm not trying to force people to believe these allegations are true, but there is enough to investigate for sure. I don't even know if it's all true obviously!
          </p>
          <p>
           The fact that another business uses another logo same street that is involved with these things is curious as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           And the fact that a Haiti Relief operated by the Clinton's same street uses even ANOTHER logo is even more curious.
          </p>
          <p>
           TL;DR someone needs to seriously look into this shit on a professional level.

         Buddy, if you spent literally 10 minutes looking into covered up cases involving children talking about the same exact ritualistic abuse over and over and over, you could very well find more than a handful.
        </p>
        <p>
         You walk in from /r/all and dismiss all of this based on one subpar graphic? Listen, it's one thing to call the image stupid but it's another thing to mock and undermine the efforts of everyone here. There is so much more to this than James Alefantis and Comet Pizza. At least do some research before you go off calling us stupid -- don't be an ignoramus.

          Except there are never any actual convictions of Satanic ritual child abuse.
         </p>
         <p>
          Because it's not a thing except in TV and movies - and because it's such a popular element in media, children commonly seize on it as a way to invent a child abuse story they think adults will find believable. With a child's lack of understanding of sex and sexual lust, weird magic is basically the only reason they can think of for an abuser's motivations.

           ...... Did you just somehow blame children for their lack of understanding of sex? And ritual Satanic abuse is "popular" in media that children watch?? Normal kids have no fucking idea that ritual Satanic abuse EXISTS let alone think, "Ah, I have no idea why this person is raping me, let me conjure this elaborate religious plot as to why they are doing it even though I have never been exposed to Satanism before."
          </p>
          <p>
           Ritual, fucked up child abuse is a thing just like parent's abusing their own children or letting their romantic partners do so is a real thing because the adult's are fucked up in the head. As someone else posted before, these things happen whether they "make sense" or not. A woman raped her one year old on webcam for a police officer's viewing pleasure not because it made sense but because SHE thought it made sense.
          </p>
          <p>
           It doesn't matter if there are convictions or not. Plenty of rich people get away with things because they are rich. You would be naive to think that a lack of conviction means there is no ritual Satanic abuse anywhere, ever.
          </p>
          <p>
           And as a personal note, I know two people that were impacted by this shit as children and WERE ritually abused. Like it or not, it exists!

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaVeyan_Satanism#Basic_tenets">
             actual tenets of Satanism.

            I don't understand how it's a shock to you that children have access to media that they're not supposed to; they don't live cocooned in bubbles that only Spongebob Squarepants is permitted to enter. For that matter, there's plenty of Satanic ritual abuse scenarios in even "kid-friendly" media, not graphic ones of course, but all you need is the
            <em>
             idea
            </em>
            of occult abuse of a helpless victim to start spinning these tales. Especially when there's a willing and eager audience, which was the case during the Satantic abuse panic of the 80's and 90's. And now today on Reddit, I guess.

            I'm not saying
            <em>
             sexual abuse
            </em>
            of children doesn't take place. Of course it does. What I'm saying is that
            <em>
             Satanic sexual abuse of children
            </em>
            has not ever actually been known to take place. Why would it? If you're the sort of pedophile who finds
            <em>
             gratification
            </em>
            in the sexual abuse of children, you don't need the excuse of being a (fictional) Satanist; if you're just a regular person, the very
            <em>
             idea
            </em>
            is so abhorrent that you'd simply abandon the cult.
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean we would hardly need to look very far in DC or in any American city to find a network for trafficking young people, especially young women, for purposes of sexual abuse. You just wouldn't look in a fucking
            <em>
             neighborhood pizzeria.
            </em>
            You'd look for connections to the
            <em>
             other
            </em>
            thing that gets trafficked beyond the eyes of the law: narcotics. Sexual trafficking of children occurs parallel to the
            <em>
             drugs trade
            </em>
            , not parallel to
            <em>
             campaigns for the office of President.
            </em>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             And as a personal note, I know two people that were impacted by this shit as children and WERE ritually abused.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I notice you drop
            <em>
             Satanic
            </em>
            and
            <em>
             sexual
            </em>
            from this, specifically. That proves to me that you're attempting to misleadingly offer some unrelated (but tragic) abuse as an example of what we're talking about, when it most certainly isn't.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or, I mean, you're just lying.

          Yeah buddy the shills still around, with usernames likes literallyashill. They for sure really shills. You aren't crazy just everyone who disagrees or even questions your opinion or this sub's is obviously a shill.
         </p>
         <p>
          I mean there's maybe a tiny fraction of a fantasy's chance that these ARE shills but their goal must not be to discredit the subject but discredit YOU by making you look paranoid and crazy calling everyone shills.
         </p>
         <p>
          But chances are they just trolls/people who disagree. Because believe it or not mentioning pizza in an email is hard to connect to pedophilia. I mean how about some ACTUAL proof. You think if you hacked a shit tons of emails you'd have some actual proof and not just talk about pizza that you have to decrypt.

            Well you actually should try and think about it like that because it makes sense and even if it's not true it's what the common perception of you is going to be so perhaps you'll need to work on it if you want to convey your message.

         You guys make yourselves completely clear when you do "call me out" or whatever.  It's really lame.  Whenever i call you fuckers out,  there's plenty (like you) that keep piling on,  which confirms my suspicions in the first place.  You guys suck.  To any other shills reading this,  I know it's hard out here,  but please consider getting a real fucking job. Even a crack dealer adds more to our society than you spineless,  nauseating pawns.  But imma let you finish...

          I guess it's actually pretty pointless to even argue with you, because you already believe that I am in some sort of network trying to talk some sense into you.

       Its not just based on that graphic theory. It takes some time to really understand it as its pretty complex. However, with the new leaks from Podesta's mail, its now looking extremely likely. Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCPKcw7WX7Y

        It really seems like people are so uncomfortable with this topic as a whole they write it all off as "fucking stupid". It's sad to see such a small amount of critical thinking is stopping them from seeing what a scandal of epic proportions this really is.

         I don't think people think it's stupid because it makes them uncomfortable. They think it's stupid because it's fucking stupid.

          Ok. What is stupid about it? There is enough evidence saying there might be something going on, at least enough to merit an investigation. Is there an actual counter argument to not look into this and why we should just bury it as stupid?

           The part where you lost me was the logo symbolism. I think it's fucking stupid. Whole thing reads like a bad DaVinci code/illuminati conspiracy.

            The logos are a real thing though. Just because you view it as fake because the same premise has been loosely used in a movie doesn't actually make it fake.

             Apparently american dollar bills (also come on, use real metal coins for dollars, I know the American Mint makes them, but they're more for collection than anything else. Like the Kennedy half-dollar) don't exist.

            You realize that the symbolism you're sneering at is recognized by the FBI? This isn't 4chan bullshitting, the symbols used by these venues (which coincidentally are all near each other) are literally known pedophilia symbols. They use symbols for obvious reasons; to signal to others that they are "in the know". How else would you do it if you were a pedophile?
           </p>
           <p>
            Furthermore this isn't even the first time a pedophile ring involving politicians was on the brink of being busted. Britain suppressed multiple investigations as did Belgium, through a combination of the subjects of the investigation having the political clout to shield themselves, and others being afraid to reveal such flagrant and rampant criminality to the public out of the fear of inciting rioting.

             Yes, but nobody knows that except pedophiles. Which means a lot of people will use something that accidentally looks similar to that logo because they had no idea that was something to avoid.

            Which logo? Because one of them is CLEARLY a pedophile symbol, the one for little boys in the Pizza. What is the likelyhood of ALL of the other findings occuring and they just HAPPEN to have the symbol for little boy lover in their pizza logo? I'm not squinting my eyes to see it. It's blatant. The butterfly/pingpong one is iffy, the double heart one is iffy, but the Pizza triangular spiral is not iffy. IT IS the logo. You can't deny it.

            Just because you don't use symbols for pedophilia doesn't mean pedophiles don't. These are officially recognized by the FBI. Sick fucks use these symbols and other variations in order to communicate to other pedos.

           It's stupid because there's no place to start, here - there's no complaining victim, there's no story from anyone involved to corroborate. Just the purely circular reasoning that because there's no evidence of the crime, that proves the cover-up, which proves that the crime must have occurred.
          </p>
          <p>
           The whole thing falls apart when you realize a "pizza-related map" is just a map of DC's good pizza spots. Maybe that's strange if you live somewhere where there's only Dominos?

             Red Bull and beef jerky. You eat those foods and then you play dominoes.

          Even if it was fake, there are some pretty interesting coincidences.  That instagram alone is incredibly creepy.

          Don't be so naive as to dismiss all these possibilities, brother.  I understand it'd make much more sense for them to have just banged your hot 'waitress'.   Who knows, to have all those hot dogs and pizza flown in doesn't seem too fishy to me as it's happening IN the White House.  The other stuff however is too CRAZY coincidental.  One has to keep in mind, these terrible people are on a whole different kinda mental level.  Like a few users mentioned below, I'd highly suggest you take a look into what others have already suggested.  It's pretty wild :/

           No external food is allowed in the White House, not even sauces, they have to make everything from scratch in there.

            Behind close doors who knows man.  I understand there are protocols involved, and I'm sure, heavily enforced (with POTUS involved) but there have been many protocols broken before.  People get sloppy and lax bro, not to say we're not onto anything definitive or anything, but sometimes things like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E548-OkACkc occur and then we find ourselves on the path to the truth.  Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction man

            ? How is that not obvious to you? I'm not really buying into this shit yet either but it's certainly fishy enough to at least look at it seriously.

            I can't tell you how to live your life brother, but for one to do so under ignorance, is to be chained and shackled to the idea of thinking he/she  is a free person.  The same way I am asking others to look into this with an open mind, is the same way I'll be if this turns out for this not to be true.  Hope I made sense.

         I ran a treatment facility for girls who had been trafficked and abused for 2 years, I can assure you my thoughts aren't coming from being uncomfortable with the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will throw you guys this bit if you are really that concerned about this plague. More kids are being trafficked through your city than you realize, that hotel you got for a great deal has been used for these purposes, your local cops know about the problem and some are helping. Perhaps even more disgusting is there are cops who handle these cases who know other cops are involved but can't/wont seemingly do anything about it.

          Well if that's the case and  you agree that it's already happening under our noses, THEN YOU SHOULD AGREE THIS ISN'T STUPID AND SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO.

             I thought it was interesting when it first came out, read a bit about it, but reading this sub has brought me to that conclusion, yes. There are groups of elites out there abusing kids, and hell the people connected to this could even be abusing kids, but the opinions put forth on this sub are not evidence to support it.

            So, you admit that police and other officials are involved. You also admit that hotels are involved. And yet somehow a PIZZA PLACE being involved is insane? When food joints have been used in the past as a front for criminal activity? Other pizza places around the country have also been found to have been used to produce CP as well.

         People don't want to believe that there is systematic child abuse within the upper echelons of society, especially that of politicians. It alters their worldview on a base level so drastically that they'd rather sweep it under the rug. Getting redpilled isn't easy.

         You're saying people not believing in this conspiracy theory need to be better at critical thinking? I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be the other way around - you guys in this sub have absolutely zero critical thinking.

       Hey, I know that a few clips of oddness aren't convincing. And each little thing taken alone seems coincidental. It's the entire package which makes it very odd. There is definitely pedophilia rings within the government. 
What has been found from this source: http://pastebin.com/ZykxjTRL
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a bunch of links which repeat information, some dive deeper some not so much, but i'll try my best to sum them up here:
-The children trafficking in Haiti that involves Hillary. A woman who was investigating this tying to the Clinton Foundation was just found dead last week.
      </p>
      <p>
       -The largest pedophile ring exposed that was covered by abc news coincidentally after Anthony weiner's laptop was taken.
      </p>
      <p>
       -John Podesta's brother, Tony Podesta's affinity for provacative art which includes statues of Jeffery Dhamer's victim's pose and young children naked. Tony Podesta is a lobbyist in Washington, and is an employee of the Saudis who also have issues with Child Trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       -References to Moloch and sacrifices of chickens found in the emails of the DNC staff.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Marina Abromovic and her spiritcooking which is satanic in nature along with John Podesta's invite via email. Marina stated on an AMA that in private dinners, it's NOT art.
      </p>
      <p>
       -References to pedophilia in the podesta emails, such as the hankerchief pizza/map being left behind. Along with a bunch of other code words like: playing dominos on pizza or pasta?
      </p>
      <p>
       -References to Comet Ping Pong found in the emails in DC which is the restaurant that high ups are close with along with a couple other restaurants nearby with possible pedo connections and galleries where Hillary is seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Comet ping pong having creepy stuff such as the owner posting disturbing images on his instagram (a child taped to a ping pong talbe, marina abromovic, child with money in their mouth, "Infant Lover" t-shirt).
      </p>
      <p>
       -Comet Ping pong's favorite friend for entertainment, Majestic Ape (of Heavy Breathing), which is an artist that has provocative music with artwork that involves both children and sex (words "All the Chidlren" with babies crawling, and a child with a phallic toy in its mouth, mentions of pedophilia in captions, cartoons of sex artwork).
      </p>
      <p>
       -Comet Ping Pong having a pedophilia symbol in its logo along with the nearby restaurants having other pedophilia symbols (the triangular spiral, the butterfly, the heart).
      </p>
      <p>
       -An abandoned, unknown but verified, underground tunnel system that runs right underneath these restaurants and connects them
      </p>
      <p>
       -A government official commenting on the instagram of comet pizza happens to be involved in convicting pedophiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Etc.. etc..

         For me, the biggest things are the pictures of the children on instagram (taped to the table, money), and the pizza-handkerchief emails.
        </p>
        <p>
         Even trying to stretch to give the benefit of the doubt, I can't think of reasonable explanations for those things.
        </p>
        <p>
         I retained skepticism that Clinton was involved, but if it's true that that woman was investigating the Clinton Foundation for trafficking, then her death is extremely suspicious.

        Just read, even thinner and even crazier. This reminds me of that nursery that redditors terrorized. There is legitimately not a shred of evidence someone not crazy can explain. The symbols offenders use are intentionally innocuous and supposed to fly under the radar. Those crossed ping pong paddles are more like crossed swords. A pizza place being a dive is a rule not some sort of abberation. Their social media belongs on /r/oldpeoplefacebook.
       </p>

        Listen, I have worked with kids who have been abused for 10 years. I specifically work with girls who had been trafficked for 2. It is a real issue and is far more pervasive than people realize, but this is just a witch hunt

         Look at the pictures of babies and children with them and tell us they look fine. One peculiar thing is that they all have darkened under-eyes, like if they were not 40 year olds drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes like crazy sleeping 3 hours a night. Anyone can claim to be a child protection worker. The CPS in the US is actually a bad thing, stealing children from people without any reason, in fact they don't need any. Also it doesn't take 14 minutes to start believing this, I know it took me a couple days and pretty much a week of research to have no doubts, now what we have to find out is that place in Hawaii in the underground where the dead children might have been sent, how there's wifi coming out of the ground of somewhere near that factory of this guy selling junk hard drives with rave reviews on amazon, which of course nobody would buy a 20gb hard drive from a company that doesn't exist anymore that mostly broken, except for a TrueCrypt volume with a bunch of CP from the regular to the horrendous.

         Next leads are still likely available in the Podesta wikileaks. I'm worried about Assange though. He didn't say if that was the last of it. James Alefentis and TONY "pedophile picture in the dictionnary" Podesta is even more important to investigate than John. Wish somebody hacked his shit...

          Yeah, I'm going to call BS on that. I have family that works with CPS, and there are plenty of good reasons to take kids. If one was wanting to actually kidnap children, CPS would be a pretty shitty way to bring them in. I do however agree with the rest of what you said

Schaefer authored an investigation in which, among other findings, revealed the following: “…the separation of families is growing as a business because local governments have grown accustomed to having taxpayer dollars to balance their ever-expanding budgets. The Adoption and the Safe Families Act, set in motion by President Bill Clinton, offered cash “bonuses” to the states for every child they adopted out of foster care. In order to receive the “adoption incentive bonuses” local child protective services need more children. They must have merchandise (children) that sell and you must have plenty of them so the buyer can choose. Some counties are known to give a $4,000 bonus for each child adopted and an additional $2,000 for a “special needs” child. In this document, Schaefer makes it clear that organizations, such as The Second Mile, procure their underage victims by making children wards of the State. CPS has unchecked legal authority to remove children, with or without cause. Subsequently, CPS and their partners, the corrupt juvenile court judges can place these children wherever they see fit (e.g. The Franklin House, Boys Town, Elm House, The Second Mile Foundation) where unimaginable horrors take place.

           Schaefer and her husband died under very mysterious circumstances at their home in Georgia in March of 2010.

            Yeah, except they have over a million children in the foster care system that are "ripe" for adoption purposes. Additionally, if you would pay attention, I said I agree with the rest of your point. You aren't going to win any allies telling people to STFU when they AGREE with you.

           Bad choice of words. What I meant is that some things are now not even open for debate, the first stuff that was uncovered, now the very many peripheral avenues that go from this have to be scrutinized with an objective, scientific mind.

            The human mind is adept at finding elaborate patterns--often of things that aren't actually there. Finding patterns is easy--testing their validity with skepticism, counterarguments, and logic is the hard part. Great! You found a pattern! Now try to disprove it every way you can think of. If it survives that test, then and only then do you have a strong case.

             You're going out of your way to defend John and Tony Podesta is all I can see from this and HerRoyalCunt, of course. Leave it, you think I haven't read this sort of thing before? I've done enough LSD and shrooms to understand patterns and fractals, that I still remembered when sober. The logic, non-emotional part, I can apply now, I was shaken like anyone normal when I read what's on pedocrats.com. Until you read what's on there and in the order suggested, don't bother bro.

             That's all very nice, except you haven't really disproved anything. You also haven't answered to the multiple pedophiles that Tony Podesta associates with along with artwork of child abuse in his home, the connections between the Clintons and human trafficking, this "pizza restaurant" that posts pictures of children taped down to a table, a walk-in freezer with comments talking about "hosing it down after use", etc. The fact that you aren't even a little worried by this means you are either a shill or just a fool.

             Do I think people should go to jail for these kinds of evidence alone? No, of course not. But the behavior and associations by those involved are disturbing and highly suspect.

         Can you talk about some specific criticisms/rebuttals you have rather than ad hominem attacks on the credibility of the users here? This type of posting where you talk a lot about the redditors/subreddit without any specifics about what is being discussed is a common discussion derailment technique.

        One of the emails says the following exercpt:
        <em>
         "the realtor found a pizza-related map on a napkin"
        </em>
        , can you give me any ideas as to how that is literally not a code for something? And that's not the only instance in which stilted, nonsensical language is used in emails between these people.

         Why would "pizza-related map" be "code for something" and not just refer to a map about pizzerias?

          It was not at a pizzeria. It was sent to John Podesta and it was a hankerchief. Please also explain "Do you think I would play dominoes better on pasta or pizza?"

           Then it was probably a pocket square, which is an item that can be screen printed with a variety of graphics, and a foodie might well have one printed with a novelty map of DC's pizza spots. Thrillist has a map of burger joints, for instance. I bet I could get it printed on a pocket square in 2 workdays.

          Why would the realtor deem it necessary to notify a client that they discovered a napkin at a residence, and why would they be so specific about the type of napkin they found? I guess napkins are REALLY important to rich people, huh

           It sounds like it was a pocket square, actually, and like a nice tie, those can be expensive enough that you'd want them returned if lost.

       Probably being upvoted by the scared pedophiles lurking this sub to see if it actually blows up. Anyways I've been following this from the beginning.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        It started as 4chan anon telling everyone to focus on the human trafficking bit when researching the Clinton Foundation
       </li>
       <li>
        Next someone discovered Comet Ping Pong as being a money-laundering operation, more likely a human trafficking front (lots of money exchanges involving the DNC and even Soros donated $20000 + undisclosed amounts to this "pizza" place
       </li>
       <li>
        People cracked the code words these criminals use for hiding their human trafficking in plain site, a lot of podesta emails seem to confirm this
       </li>
       <li>
        Next the Comet Ping Pong owner's instagram was discovered with all types of dark shit, little girl taped to a table, baby's first pizza, murder room, some more stuff, it's all archived somewhere.
       </li>
       <li>
        Next people found the super creepy Amanda Kleinman videos and her "pizza-party"
       </li>
       <li>
        nearby pizza places (besta pizza) use obvious pedophile symbols in their logos
       </li>
       <li>
        lots of bizarre websites found that seem to be trafficking fronts like http://drpong.net/manifest.php linked to Comet Ping Pong
       </li>
       <li>
        someone also found the Lauren Silsby connection although I can't recall exactly what it was
       </li>
       <li>
        someone else found the madelyn mccane connection with the podestas, it's not like the podestas have come out yet and said this is all crazy, the Mccane connection seems obvious, the whole case was a mess and Venezuela even claims to know who the kidnappers are but they couldn't pursue
       </li>
       <li>
        some more stuff, this is really simplified, all from just off the top of my head
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Anyways I've been following this for a while and the evidence just keeps stacking up to indicate this thing is huge. It goes a lot deeper than the pizza places but this is a good focal point for busting the dam open. This happened a few years ago with pedogate in the uk, it's not so crazy once we realize that, also turkey is literally trying to legalize pedophilia right now if you marry the victim afterwards. Pizzagate is blowing up there the most according to twitter and google trends. You've gotta realize that the fbi can't do anything about this and you won't hear it on the news. This and 4chan and 8chan are some of the only ways we have to try and spread this information.

       I've looked through a majority of your comments on this post, so I'm aware of your background with this kind of stuff. You do not see people out marching on the street against the suspected people, because they know as well as you do there is not enough evidence. Just as it would be extremely difficult for investigations to prove what hotels are used for trafficking, yet details lead reason to suspect, that is the same case with this.

       Hysteria, you've got it. No wonder on 420 we tell people to go back to Reddit...although I know that chans and reddit crossover a hell lot depending on the subreddits. Which makes somethingawful even less relevant, which is good for everybody.

      That image host was specifically promoted by ciswhitemaelstrom, a self admitted rapist and white supremacist, and his ilk as an alternative to imgur. It was one of The_Donald's mods first money grab that caused them to doxx and blackmail each other over control.

       Are you actually criticizing the server used to host the image while ignoring the image itself. You are either a shill or incredibly fucked in the head.

      Btw just because it's a "conspiracy theory" doesn't mean that it isn't real. Taking a decent look at the evidence and it becomes quite clear that st the very least, there is something very not right going on concerning some key members of the Clinton staff.

       With conspiracy theories, there's always a thread left to unravel. There's always some "evidence" that is ignored by the general population because "WHY DON'T THEY SEE WHAT I SEE?"
      </p>
      <p>
       And you can't talk such people away from it. They don't want to hear it. Every rebuttal of evidence is met with another circuitous reach of logic.

       If you're becoming Charlie looking for Pepe Silvia, you've gone too far.

        I'm just saying that some of the stuff that's in the Wikileaks emails for everyone in the world to read is pointing to something rather unusual and shady particularly involving the Podestas and possibly more people.

         Except that whenever the actual e-mails are posted it's clear that the conspiracy theorists pushing a narrative are misquoting and misinterpreting them on purpose.

         You THINK it's pointing to something.

        <p>
         Everyone THOUGHT the emails about the art exhibit were to do with ritual human sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
         Please excuse me if I don't immediately get super scared about another unproven conspiracy theory from people reading into super secret "codes" from e-mails talking about nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's reaching. It's looking for something to be afraid of. It's searching for that ONE thing that's gonna be the smoking gun and tip the scales and then everyone who is "in" on the pizzagate gets to be the hero.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's happened a thousand times before. People are connecting things that don't exist.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 5 years, you're gonna regret getting into this. Not in a "the government will make you regret it!" way, but a s aperson, I think you'll age out and look back on it and go "yeah.. we did sort of fill in our own blanks".

           I've lived through a few of these. It's nothing. It's always nothing. I've been a PART of my fair share of conspiracy theories and such. It's people creating information and connecting dots that don't exist.

           I am 100% okay with not being liked for a cynical opinion about it.

           Hey if it's a real thing in 5 years after all these people have been prosecuted or not, we'll have another chat and one of us will be right and the other will be wrong.

            There are way too many people looking into this at this point and way too many dots connecting. I think it may take some time to reach out to the broader public but yes I do think that this scandal is quite real.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember the entire Jimmy Saville scandal a couple years back? Remember how they mentioned that supposedly hundreds of people in high up positions in government and royal society and elites were involved but gen the investigation just magically went nowhere after Saville died?

             Hey, this guy is a troll. Don't mind him. There have been many times when "conspiracy theories" turned out to be more than nothing and we all know it. We know that the Clinton campaign paid internet trolls before the election so we know they are doing it now to save face with John Pedosta. We can't even call this thing a conspiracy anymore. There's too much proof and the fact that the news, which we know now for sure is pretty much fake, is now focusing on "fake news", they are panicking. No news channel is showing the mugshots that look like tony and John, or the Instagram pictures of alefanis, or talking about Monica Petersen. These are the main things that make this so real, and they're leaving that out on purpose. If the owners didn't have something to hide, they would be reporting on this shit all day long.

             Honestly, that shouldn't be a reason to discount someone's opinion. Their statements can stand or fall on their own merits. Either they're factual, or they aren't.
            </p>
            <p>
             For instance, something y'all are forgetting is that throughout an investigation you should always remain skeptical. You should leave room for the fact that the original theory
             <em>
              could
             </em>
             be full of shit, and then let the evidence prove to you that it's in fact true. Beyond a reasonable doubt.
            </p>
            <p>
             Instead you're going in reverse order, found some circumstantial evidence that formed a story, and now you're digging for evidence to prove it. I don't see many skeptics anymore, and anyone who remains skeptical gets tarred and feathered.
            </p>
            <p>
             A lot of stock has been put into the "let's get pizza for an hour" statement, translated to mean they were molesting a child, but the pizza joint was also a ping pong palace, so maybe they had an hour to kill eating pizza and playing some table tennis? As soon as a 'sport' is involved you can add a timeframe and it doesn't seem that unusual, but instead, without context, it's a damning piece of evidence (who eats pizza for an hour?).
            </p>
            <p>
             Before I get tore up here I will say that I see some really weird anomalies in the interrelationships between the people being investigated, but I'm also keeping a healthy dose of skepticism (as we all should). I'm not going to say that you all haven't found anything, because there's definitely evidence worth exploring, only that there's enough bogus evidence lumped in with the legit stuff that it kinda taints everything.
            </p>
            <p>
             And I'm a partial believer. Sooner or later the community will have to sort through what you've found to determine if the evidence is legitimate, and if not, discard it and focus on the other leads that are paying off.

            Oh so because it's happened 'a few' times, that means all similar future events hold the same fate? The lack of logic in that  statement is staggering, and leads me to believe you are a shill or just plain retarded.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just because conspiracies 'fall flat' with no-one being prosecuted, that does not mean they are not true either.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, what about the many 'conspiracies' that were proven to be true?

            Sure, there are people who might be getting ahead of themselves but you can't dismiss an entire theory because a few people aren't on the right track. You have to explore every available piece of evidence if you are doing a proper investigation, after all. To say that we are all connecting 'dots that don't exist' is extremely misleading. We are at the point where you have to be mentally challenged to not see the connection between some of the available evidence and pedophilia.

             The internet helps spread information. Not all that information is going to be verifiable. There's no "this MUST be true" requirement for people to share it online. Some of it's gonna be just plain wrong and even sometimes created by people who know it is wrong for views, money, attention, whatever.
            </p>
            <p>
             And all the different avenues people have online are part of that. Even just youtube itself has maybe millions of conspiracy videos.
            </p>
            <p>
             Never before have humans had a way to share information so quickly with each other. It's responsible for quite a lot of new phenomena just by people being able to connect with each other instantaneously and on a massive scale.

           I just went through the image posted. It's a fucking joke. This pizza parlor has a heart in the logo, well a heart is a sooper sekret logo for pedophiles so because there's a heart it's obviously related.

          Golf of Tonken being fake is REACHING. The sterilization and experimental science done on people that were label to have psychosis is REACHING. The way our Federal reserve was put into place by a handful of individuals including the father of HW Bush is REACHING. HW Bushing coming out in 1949 to Congress in sighting the red scare in Hollywood is REACHING.
         </p>
         <p>
          What is ppl like you aren't skeptical of the individuals involved so you give them a pass. You're skeptical of this research so you condem it. What you should be doing is researching FOR YOURSELF to make YOUR OEN CONCLUSIONS instead of saying 'persuade me'.
         </p>
         <p>
          That's like saying prove to me quantum physics is real and what its about without knowing anything about quantum physics. You cannot come to your own conclusions with any merit unless you have done research on thebtopic yourself. Dismissing something from a picture is not skepticism.

           You keep telling me to make my own conclusions, but when those conclusions are "you guys are reaching", I'm suddenly wrong for making my own conclusions when they don't line up with what you want? Hypocrisy.

            I came here from r/all too brother. I have not made any conclusions and being dismissive is not being skeptic. To be skeptic you have to research h yourself and judging from your temperament it seems like you've done no research into the topic but rather dismissed is from one image linked from by a stranger. And to me that seems like someone who cannot make or hold an argument that holds water. Because that would require unbiased research that again it really seems like you haven't done.

             You're very sure I haven't read up on it at all. You're very sure I didn't just simply reach a different conclusion. Just because I don't post here doesn't mean I don't see it when it crops up, or that I never saw when it was linked in /r/asnwers or /r/outoftheloop, or that I didn't follow it during the election itself during Podesta's 15 minutes of infamy, or that I couldn't have re-followed up when everyone was having another 90s moral panic attack.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe you're seeing what you want to see.
            </p>
            <p>
             EVERYONE has bias, but I think lots of people have assumed something is true and then tried to pick facts that justify it, like every conspiracy theory ever.

        Please look up Operation Yewtree in the UK.

       <p>
        A lot of people ignored the people involved in that for decades because it seemed impossible.
       </p>
       <p>
        This stuff happens, whether you like to believe in it or not. I think there's enough in these emails to at least warrant an investigation, not just brush it under the carpet.
       </p>
       <p>
        I sincerely hope it turns out to be just another conspiracy theory.

        Or you take this stuff so seriously you find a picture of a baby in the Wikileaks emails with a special greeting for Mr Podesta but you don't post it bc of the possibility it's somehow another harmless coincidence.  Yeah, we are all just unreasonable conspiratorial nuts with no life.

            I found it over a week ago but have not posted it because I don't think it will help towards solving anything .. but does add to the mounting evidence of JP's weird (inappropriate?) relationship with small children and their moms.
           </p>
           <p>
            My main concern is that the baby's name is written on the poster which is pictured next to the baby.
           </p>
           <p>
            "..........., Podesta.  (A red heart), R
            <strong>
             <em>
              _
             </em>
            </strong>
            __"
           </p>
           <p>
            I've been waiting bc posting it will bring attention to this baby and her mom.   They are easily found on fb.  I worry about them being harassed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Honestly, the only thing I could think of that explains this photo message is that he is the father.

        Conspiracy theories often start with a conclusion that is walked backwards with confirmation bias.  This whole pizza gate affair has been a constant flow of mounting evidence that is pointing to something pretty awful. (something that happens and has happened before)

         Yeah nobody imagined this. The Pedesta emails and the sleuthers all figured out a lot of things. The FBI chart for mostly boy fuckers, not girls. But the more you read the emails the more you figure out what goes on in there. No way they're eating 3 month old pasta, playing dominos on pasta or pizza etc. I recommend listening to the Opperman Report show from last saturday to get a good idea about it all : https://www.spreaker.com/user/oppermanreport/pizzagate-child-trafficking-allegations-

           Conspiracies DO exist. And are worth investigating, but to an outsider, that's very much not the tone of the subreddit or the people that are "investigating" it.

             I've read up a bit. I'm not convinced. I choose to remain an outsider because I don't believe it.

            <p>
             It's why I won't sub, and it's why I choose to remain soured from the exact same thing from during the campaign.

        Step one of a proof involves assuming that the statement to be proved is true. Otherwise you can't see if it holds up to previously learned information. Dismissing information purely because it sounds outrageous goes against this. All information is plausible until actual work has been done to prove or disprove.

           Reddit also used their great detective skills to accuse the wrong man of being the Boston bomber.

           If this really revealed anything why aren't people like Amash and Rand Paul coming out to start investigatiions and hearings? You would think if this was proof every political enemy would be jumping on this....

             So let me get this straight.  ANYONE that doesn't buy into this conspiracy theory is a shill?
            </p>
            <p>
             No one can disagree with you for real?
            </p>
            <p>
             What kind of delusional self righteous paranoid bubble do you live in?
            </p>
            <p>
             Check my history dumbass. I'm just a regular 41 year old guy working at Amazon with a healthy amount of skepticism.
            </p>
            <p>
             Calling everyone that doubts you a shill is the same as calling every Trump supporter a racist. You're just pushing regular people further away.

             You're calling him a shill because he's lying? So you don't even really believe it, you're just using it as an insult?

          I subscribe to the viewpoint that religion isn't confirmed nor denied. I truly won't know until I've died. As an atheist, I believe that there is nothing, but I don't know for sure.

           L. Ron Hubbard's religion states (word for word)
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            The head of the Galactic Confederation (76 planets around 
larger stars visible from here) (founded 95,000,000 yrs ago, very space opera) solved overpopulation (250 billion or so per planet) -- 178 billion average) by mass implanting. He caused people to be brought to Teegeeack (Earth) and put an H Bomb on the principal volcanoes (Incident 2) and then the Pacific area ones were taken in boxes to Hawaii and the Atlantic Area ones to Las Palmas and there "packaged." His name was Xenu. He used renegades. Various misleading data by means of circuits etc. were placed in the implants.  When through with his crime Loyal Officers (to the people) captured him after 6 years of battle and put him in an electronic mountain trap where he still is. "They" are gone. The place (Confed.) has since been a desert.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Are you telling me that you can neither confirm nor deny existence of the Galactic Confederation and Hubbard is the only person in 75 million years to discover the existence of his hidden impant?

     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Term conspiracy theorist is a loaded term, basically a politically correct thoughtcrime label much like islamophobic or racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's designed to slur people who present a narrative that is contradictory to the mainstream media / government line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Few people know that it was weaponised by the CIA in 1967 to put a 'chill' on any debate, cover up and isolate critics during the Nixon and JFK conspiracies (actually proved conspiracies that were once a theory until proven!)
      </p>
      <p>
       In short conspiracy theorist is a neutral term which means you believe you have valid reasons to believe that those in power are lying about a certain issue, -and you have a theory about it. This is perfectly natural. In fact I as a Brit can appreciate the US founding fathers encouraged a "healthy suspicion of all authority and power wherever it lies". It's the death of suspicion and the "trust your betters" attitude which creates fertile ground for wrongdoing. Now, if you wish to question wrongdoing of those in power, All they have to do is call you conspiracy theorist and the masses are trained to be repelled by you.

          And therefore it is bullshit is the implication right? Because things that aren't fully proven are always untrue right?

       Yes, the 1967 CIA memo to rebuff those unhappy with the Warren Commission. And the memo says to contact all of their media assets, back in the 50's the CIA was convinced it could kill a news story in 24 hours, in the 60's even faster, and now it would be at the flip of a switch I imagine, which is why MSM isn't even bothering yet, although the NY Post published a strange article where criminals were caught because of pizza.

         For real, man. If your entire stance is "everyone's afraid of getting their feelings hurt.... OH NO MY FEELINGS ARE HURT" followed up by "everyone who disagrees with me is getting paid" then you're just a silly stereotype of a person.

      It's not even just about pizza parlors. There have been other food places involved and other businesses entirely (child-oriented services like daycare or foster homes).

        No. Obviously you have no idea what you're talking about. Not of people ordering pizza. Big Cheese LLC owns Comet Pizza, when you search Big Cheese LLC you end up with other connections to these places. There are other Big Cheese LLC's that are suspicious. Also in affiliation with those same business owners in DC as Comet Pizza is Politics and Prose, Little Red Fox, and Besta Pizza. Andrew Kline is tied to those as well. He has represented We The Pizza too.
       </p>
       <p>
        And no, it isn't someone just calling and ordering pizza. I would like to question why you are questioning the second meaning of cheese pizza. There are even facebook groups about "cheese pizza" in which the members are blatantly aware they are talking about child porn. Cheese pizza is already known to also mean CP so I don't understand why it is absurd to believe a PIZZA place could be a front for child abuse or trafficking.
       </p>
       <p>
        Edit: It's clear you have no idea what this reddit is about if you think people are suspicious for calling and ordering pizza. Either that or you blatantly don't care about any evidence we've gathered and/or are in denial that there is anything suspicious with these places.

          People ORDERING PIZZA is not the issue. Child trafficking and child abuse is the issue. And the belief that some god damn pizza places, or daycares, or other business could be a front for human trafficking is not far fetched.

      I couldn't say no to my girlfriend when she said she'd make her amazing fat crust pizza, but I had to take some anti-nausea meds. Some of the days last week had me overtaking anxiety and nausea meds when getting to know about this shit, deep. pedocrats.com has the most fucking scary shit.

     Yeah actual gamers just list the name of the game. This is disturbing. Because they talk about Dominos all the time with a fucking capital letter but never name the game.

    <p>
     What is it? Mexican train? Snake? What are you playing so frequently that you must mention it, but the game is taboo?

      Seriously, how dare a pizza parlor owner have "out of context" convos about pizza, cheese, and sauce. Also, how dare the logo of a ping pong place be two crossed ping pong paddles, which slightly looks like the gay crossed heart logo from the fbi pamphlet.

    Where is Mike Cernovich? He tells us all day long that he is the most feared man in media but doesn't report about Pizzagate. Where is the alternative Media? Molyneux, Cernovich, Paul Joseph Watson? This is the biggest story ever and they don't report about it. You got a former Huffington Post reporter (David Seaman) doing the work these guys are supposed to do. Notice that Cernovich, Alex Jones etc. did report about Spirit Cooking when it was just some weirdo "Art" but now that it gets serious they don't report. Either start reporting about this or stop telling us all day long that you are the real journalists.

     I suppose they dont wanna say anything until there are more evidences. Remembernthe left is pushing the fake news agenda so they cannot risk being caught reporting this if later is confirmed not to be true (my 5 cents)

     Is it time to realize that Alex Jones has been in on it the whole time? All the same evidence is there including several e-mails that indirectly name him and claim he's an integral part of the misinformation campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
     His new found silence makes it obvious he's at the very least compromised.

     Even if James Corbett is silent, but that's to be expected since he got 2 children in practically 2 years, I used to like him a bunch, then he started to have strange alliances I just couldn't bring myself to take seriously (fucking Craig Brodwick or whatever, Anarchapulco guy). No right now, the best alt media show about it all is last week's Opperman Report : https://www.spreaker.com/user/oppermanreport/pizzagate-child-trafficking-allegations-

     "The day she got to the school, I was part of a group of kids that went on a picnic with the Queen and her husband and school officials, down to a meadow near Dead Man’s Creek. After awhile, I saw the Queen leave that picnic with ten children from the school, and those children never returned. We never heard anything more about them and never saw them again even when we were older. They were all from around there but they all vanished."

    This thread is getting insanely brigaded by shills, look at all the posts from users new to this sub getting insanely upvoted while they laugh and call this an echo chamber. If this subreddit was an echochamber, the "tinfoil hats" would be the ones getting the upvotes.

   <p>
    Someone wants this discussion shutdown.

    Edit: finally we're overtaking them, but for those late to this thread when it was first posted, pretty much every "skeptic" comment was 4-5x as upvoted as the opposing view

    Well, I thought I was the only one in Canada even aware of this, at least on here, we got this way of only enjoying your culture...when it was enjoyable, can't believe the idiots who watch cooking shows since 6 years and American Idol. Anyway, I'll be keeping an eye on that.

   <p>
    I believe we all have our age limits as humans due to our lack of telomerase that can stop the shortening of our telomeres however these papers seem to suggest that essentially, aging does not have to be old, slow and miserable. Theoretically if you had a blood transfusion with a newborn according to these papers, well you all get the jist about vampires.
   </p>
   <p>
    You guys are attempting to stop something that is so deeply rooted it, something that gives sanity at the end of your days to avoid many infectious diseases, according to these papers. If you were given the option to either have brain damage for the rest of your life or to give into a sick lifestyle of regular children blood transfusions, what would you do in such a position of power. You mistake PIZZA as a side "benefit" for the sick pedophiles when in reality they were probably sacrificing young children and sacrificing babies, there true purpose, essentially farming them for their blood. If humanity wasn't so cruel I would say they even keep them alive (feeding, etc) to get the maximum amount of blood out of each of the children. We should be calling this blood farming gate or something. I doubt someone would go through all this trouble if they were not killing(farming, sacrificing, whatever) massive amounts of children.

     Spirit cooking is a thing. There is quite a lot of evidence including videos of the process and the Podesta's are known to have done this with Marina Abramovic (probably spelt that name wrong or got it completely wrong)

     Spirit cooking
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     real. There are pics of Podesta with a bandaid over his middle finger and brusied fingers all around, which is the result after you've finished a spirit cooking (you are supposed to cut your middle finger). And the emails very clearly mention spiritual cooking. The email involved Marina Abramovich and she makes pedo art.

      Really? Then why haven't the media reported ONE FUCKING THING about this?

      I have bandaids on my fingers too, mostly from either hobbies or my blue collar job.

       How about you check Wikileaks? CNN and MSNBC clearly worked for the Clinton campaign. Multiple journalists from there and also many websites were asking for advice on their articles and invited to private events. Also, I know you cannot disprove the part about Marina Abramovich.

        And it was only a coincidence Wikileaks had damaging info against Russia and after they were threatened, they dropped it?

        If WL CAN'T or WON'T go up against all people/organizations/countries trying to cover up dirty shit they are doing, they are showing bias.

         They are still releasing real information so I don't know why that matters. This isn't about Russia. It's about Podesta and Clinton.
