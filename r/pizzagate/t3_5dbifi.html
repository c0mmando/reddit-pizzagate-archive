        <strong>Important information regarding other high-profile cases related to international child sex rings</strong>
        <p><p>Hey guys,
I saw this posted somewhere, may have been here, a couple weeks ago or so. I gave it a full read and watched the related documentary and it is very eye-opening. I think it's good background information and could very well provide potential clues. Anyways, here are some links.</p>

<p>https://archive.fo/mA7TI - the senator from GA here is particularly interesting</p></p>

        <p><p>Look at the finders pdf and Dutroux on wikileaks. </p>
<p>http://tedgunderson.info/index_htm_files/US%20Customs%20Service%20Report%20of%20Investigation%20FINDERS.pdf</p>
<p>^^^ Totally legit case even if Gunderson is a shill. Govt doc. Explains a LOT. Read entire thing. = gov't involved in int'l trafficking, and blood rituals re; children. Probably to do with mind control studies. </p>
<p>Also Dutroux;</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Belgium:_Dutroux_dossier_summary,_1235_pages,_2005 </p>
<p>Tranlsation; https://dutrouxscandalanalysis.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/english-translation-of-wikileaks-dutroux-dossier-pages-1-40-of-1235/ </p>
<p>Explanation; 
http://www.lifeonchildreninthemix.com/BELGIUM.html</p>
<p>Lot of reading but this gives SOLID background info on current conditions. All legal/govt docs.</p>
<p>....
Last thing to mention here is Epstein. His legal docs are interesting. Shows direct intentional gov't protection of the predator/child pimp and prosecutors acting against interest of child victims. </p>
<p>http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2015/07/judge-unseals-more-details-in-jeffrey-epstein-underage-sex-lawsuit-210065 </p>
<p>"....excerpts of emails and letters exchanged by prosecutors and Epstein's defense (and posted here) appear to indicate that federal authorities and Epstein's lawyers worked to limit information judges might receive about aspects of the deal, which involved Epstein pleading guilty to a state charge in exchange for a guarantee not to prosecute him in federal court."</p>

        <p><p>Yeah, just had some people question the doc b/c of relationship to him. And on this one it doesn't matter except that the site links it. </p></p>

        <p><p>I find his death highly questionable. Call me suspicious but I believe he was too close to exposing them. </p></p>

        <p><p>Personally I liked Gunderson b/c he was one of the very few who had background in the area who was willing to call out these issues. I also find his death to be questionable. Dangerous times. </p></p>
