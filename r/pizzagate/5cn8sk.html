    Found new pizza pedo business connected to comet pong
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I was browsing @cometpingpong Instagram photos, checking the "likes" of each post. I checked the likes of this post http://archive.is/JPmzR
   </p>
   <p>
    &amp; I noticed one of the profiles stood out, @plentychefjodie , look at their f*cking logo http://archive.is/89XUR
   </p>
   <p>
    Look familiar? https://wikileaks.org/wiki/FBI_pedophile_symbols
   </p>
   <p>
    from their website, http://archive.is/aWyRT
   </p>
   <p>
    "Plenty is a Personal Chef Service based in Washington, DC, dedicated to preparing creative, seasonal, healthful meals
 in your home.
   </p>
   <p>
    We specialize in catering sophisticated,
    <strong>

    home dinner parties and events~tailored to your tastes and your special occasion."
   </p>
   <p>
    The website say the owner/chef is a woman named Jodie Steiner.
   </p>
   <p>
    @cometpingpong 's IG account follows @plentychefjodie , I googled @plentychefjodie and a lot of posts of them commenting on @vickieswinetable came up, theres a personal connection between the 2, and look at vickieswinetable's photo http://archive.is/VgSeo ,
   </p>
   <p>
    I think it's weird I can't find any connections between comet and @plentychefjodie in terms of being business partners, they don't link eachothers business pages or even name each other, so it's not like plentychefjodie is a branch of the Comet Pizza corp, the only connections I'm finding are personal ones outside of business.
   </p>
   <h2>
    I am going to keep digging, I'll update if I find anything

    {edit}
    <strong>
     UPDATE 1
    </strong>
    : found another pedo business conenected to comet! 
I was checking who @cometpingpong follows on IG, and they followed an account called @GreenBoxNY, that account posted this photo http://archive.is/o5fH1

    The post itself is promoting @salstomatopies , their profile is filled with tons of pedo symbols drawn right on their pizza http://archive.is/0C36Z

    @greenboxny seems to promote other pedo businesses that use their "green pizza boxes", for example, they mention they love the design of this pizza box http://archive.is/Ksh7s (look at the "dot" above the i , its the pedo symbol)

    Such a sad picture, those kids look completely empty on the inside. I really hope something happens about this all soon.

     &amp; notice the ratio of kids to adults. Take a look at the posters "
     <a href="http://archive.is/ama6z">
      Sasha Lords
     </a>
     " creates and promotes very odd/sybolic posters for bands that play at Comet Pizza
    </p>
    <p>
     http://archive.is/H14w7
    </p>
    <p>
     Notice all the posters include "KIDS ALL AGES" in bold, everytime. The shows start at 9pm, 10pm, 12pm. 
Would you ever take your young kids to these late shows to watch vulgar indie bands rock out to "edgy" music while a bunch of adults are around drinking hard alch?
    </p>
    <p>
     Aren't there laws against having kids go in businesses that late that serve hard liquor?

      Good catch.

      the girls, and none of the adults. Maybe I'm crazy, but this didn't seem very solid until I read your observation and went back and looked. Very odd, IMO.

    The 10 year party had an outside element? Outside where? Their property doesn't really have anywhere that would allow that. Need to find where this was taken.

     We know @joshuaryanv works there as the bartender, he posted a pic of that on his public IG along with many questionable pizza sex images before setting his profile private

     (edit)
The photo was taken at Comet Pong, if you go to the ig post you can see she geotagged it at Comet Pong

      I know she tagged it at Comet but look at the property overhead.

      </a>
      but in the image vickieswinetable posted, I don't see anything resembling those steel planters, just the bamboo. The ground appears to be concrete pavement in the image above and the campfire image appears to be on some sort of decking panel system.
     </p>
     <p>
      I have a hard time believing that city code would allow that type of temporary grill out on the front sidewalk as well.

     If it it means nothing why did the FBI say its the exact symbol pedos use? It would be a stretch if the logo was different or "almost", but no, the logo is the exact pedo logo. Which by itself doesn't mean much, until you realize this business follows comet pizza, is located nearby, offers "home dining services", has personal connections with @jimmycomet , you must be shilling

      The logo is suspect, but let's be careful about making accusations without more evidence.  For now, she's a person of interest.

       I agree we shouldn't accuse based off the suspect logo. But with all the other connections (follow n like eachother IG posts, same city, same personal connections to the same people that @cometpizza is has.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are separate "on paper" but theres a lot of ties between them and Jimmy comet

        I'm not saying we should not investigate or keep her in mind as a person of interest.  I'm saying be smart and be careful with your language.  This subreddit could be banned for accusing people of crimes with no evidence.
