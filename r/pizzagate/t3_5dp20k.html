        <strong>Speculation: Pro-Abortion, Rape and Rape Kits which remain unchecked even after used</strong>
        <p><p>This thought just crossed my mind, yet it makes sense why DNC is so Pro-Abortion especially if rape abortions are never tested to find the "Father" that cheated on them.</p>
<p>If possible I wonder if anyone had ever considered well if someone is raped, and they want an abortion, why don't they use the DNA of that baby to find out who the actual father is? Yet more often than not it feels like this never occurs, they just get rid of the embryo as quick as possible and let it slide under the table.</p>
<p>Yet, now this is the speculation, what if the reason this occurs is because it's politicians covering their tracks that don't want it to be known that they had sex with the person. Kill the baby, destroy the evidence, now they can't be incriminated for their actions?</p>
<p>So my thought is, is it possible to be able to cross-reference any people who went for an abortion and accussed a government official of raping them and if so, were the politicians ever charged for the crime and if the abortion did occur, did the dead fetus ever get used as evidence to compare it to the DNA of the one charged with the rape? </p></p>

        <p><p>It makes about as much sense to say that pro-life people are more likely to be pedos because they want more babies to rape. </p>
<p>Maybe "pro life" vs "pro choice" is a joke to them, and is actually a debate between sickos in DC about whether killing babies or raping them is more fun.</p></p>
