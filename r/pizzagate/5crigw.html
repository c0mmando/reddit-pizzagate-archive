    Meaning of pizza
   </strong>

    There is no doubt child trafficking going on. I did have a question about if anyone personally knew other people that use pizza as a code word, though. Its not a reliable source but on urban dictionary pizza is listed as a codeword both for "pussy" and "marijuana"
   </p>
   <p>
    Thoughts? I am doing more research cause there is an obvious "pizza culture" online that is obsessed with sex and pizza, and sexualizing pizza. No doubt it means something else among these people.

    Child Pornography is shortened to CP. CP is also called Cheese Pizza among pedos, you'd know this if you ever visited 4chan. And Cheese Pizza can again be shortened to Pizza

     Ah.. okay. I never really go to 4chan. I don't like that there isn't a search bar and it's endless scrolling. Unless I am mistaken? But thanks for the info!

      Looking at the Podesta Email that is looked into heavily is the one where he says a "handkerchief map of pizza was left behind is it yours?" also describing it as black and white. Now reading this as a normal person would this literally makes no fucking sense. Also looking through the emails, pizza is mentioned a fare bit, but usually never in a normal context. Handkerchief is coded by color by sexual act wanting/giving. Follow that along with Pizza and "map" which the map is a collection of blood or body fluids after an act is performed, almost like a trophy. Also doesn't help Jimmycomet's instagram is littered with sexual innuendos  also regarding pizza and small children.
