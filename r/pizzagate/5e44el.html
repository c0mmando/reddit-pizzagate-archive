        This is the quote in question:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         I also had the analysts arguing about not wanting more lunch from We The Pizza, a real pizza place from which Correct The Record had frequently ordered. When internet sleuths googled We The Pizza, they were stunned to discover it was a real place in the middle of Washington, D.C.—just down the street from CTR’s offices! To 4chan, this was all the proof some users needed.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        This statement doesn't make any sense; why would "arguing about not wanting more lunch from We The Pizza" trigger Internet sleuths to seek "proof"? Proof of what?
       </p>
       <p>
        IMO this journalist is behind yesterday's 2Gb hacker psyop; he stopped short of admitting it because he would risk prosecution (distribution of child porn/snuff).
       </p>
       <p>
        Remember at the start of this whole "fake news" offensive how "Real True News" was systematically cited? Well it turns out it was an agent provocateur. This whole thing (including today's article linked by OP) is a gross propaganda/psyop maneuver, not just an "experiment".

         It's not funny to even TROLL about posting CP.  It's sick shit.  The fact that people said he posted the things he did...  He should be in prison.

         I hope he gets ass raped by the biggest dick in the place.

          Couldn't agree more. And it's not only child pron, it's child SNUFF pron (torture). What kind of fucking sick fuck would try (or know how) to procure such horror?

          We need to be better than them. Wishing for sex crimes upon those who commit sex crimes is not a healthy cycle. Need to get rid of it altogether

         Tracking this whole election online and I've yet to hear of "realtruenews" even once from my Trump supporting friends and family. The articles I've seen seem to be pretty obvious bad parody and the website design is also seemingly purposely bad in an age when actual conspiracy theorists and bloggers just go on over to wordpress or tumblr.
        </p>
        <p>
         While there are nutballs who believe in this kind of stuff undoubtedly, and there are even a few very small guys out there making their own crazy "news" sites like this obvious parody, the fact is, when I've encountered them, they're all due to wiki-walking on a long night after a 10,000 link chain and then quickly forgotten. And they have no traction with their stories because they're all obviously ludicrous.
        </p>
        <p>
         This all seems highly suspect. Even if this guy was just trolling throughout the whole election, why did he
         <em>
          instantly
         </em>
         come out now to brag about it and go along with the "fake news" narrative?
        </p>
        <p>
         You'd think it would take a few weeks to dig someone like that up. That's usually how long it takes for reporters actually investigating a trend to come up with some real and genuine people.
        </p>
        <p>
         The fact that this has been "Don't listen to fake news!" one day and within a 24-36 hour period they've got multiple people admitting and bragging to it all to reinforce the idea is a bit speedy for real reporting. These folks all either want to brag to reporters (a likely possibility) to feel better about themselves, or it's been set up in advance to reinforce the narrative, a technique that's been seen many a time by now.

     Don't worry, he's bragging now, but I'm sure everyone will realize what a faggot he was once they look into Pizzagate and realize it's serious. Bragging about this kind of shit is what kids do anyway, nothing to get riled over.

     you would imagine that a normal person wouldn't even joke about this, even if they thought it was fake. but these pseudo-writers these days just want to be edgelords.

     No, that was likely legit. About an hour after that post went up I watched 3 different pizza websites connected to all of this all suddenly switch to a "coming soon" placeholder page.

      I watched it too. I lean towards believing it. I think this article is aimed to cast doubt on yesterday's incident.

       It happened (there are plenty of posts about it from yesterday if you look) but it all now seems to be a part of a poorly executed hoax.  The fact that the website went down in conjunction with that thread means there are 3 main possibilities:
      </p>
      <p>
       (a) A massive coincidence that 1000 people watched real time
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) We The Pizza was in on the hoax (which means they are also connected to an idiot who posted CP on a public forum)
      </p>
      <p>
       (c) The "hack" was legitimate and the poster was just completely inept, and had no idea what they were doing, or how deep of shit they might be in
      </p>
      <p>
       My money is on B, and if the pizza place was in on a "hoax", to what end?  They are then implicated in posting CP, which is most likely what they were attempting to discredit with a hoax.  Maybe they wanted to spur a witch hunt, again to discredit the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole event was bizarre and has confounded me -- maybe that was the only goal?
      </p>
      <p>
       Other people are right, however, who ever did this committed a felony and should be punished by the full extent of the law.

        It's also possible that they were innocent and that when they realized they were under attack the website went down while they wiped off traces of personal info to prevent harassment of friends and family. But like I said, I lean towards believing that the hack really happened and now they're covering up ... in which case, OP is probably dead, folks.

         Or they could be kids ddossing the website and then claim to have done more for attention. They said they got a 2gb harddrive (which means it was probably an external hard drive plugged into the computer as the standard computers usually come with a 4gb) by social engineering, pretending to be a network technician. That's a very sophisticated attack at a professional level that takes months of planning. We'll never know until he finds his supposed friend who did it. If it was real.

        As a mod, do you see the posters' IP address in your interface? If so, please post it here. After all, he is a criminal for procuring/distributing child snuff/porn. If you won't, look-it up and please give us some indication (tor node, US IP, dynamic range, etc.). It would be cool if you had also the HTTP USER_AGENT; Reddit admins have it for sure.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you don't have the IP, perhaps are you in good enough terms with Reddit admins to get it? Or you could recommend that Reddit files charges against him (again - child porn! Reddit should do this anyway). Then that complaint could be released and we'd see where the connection originated. We could assess his declaration of him being on a "direct open wifi"; if it's that journalist, he'd probably have been dumb enough to connect directly without proxying.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are so many clues this was a hoax there's no doubt about it. However I don't know whether We Pizza was in on it or whether they preferred taking everything offline given the scrutiny. Next time, I expect the "hacker" psyop against this sub to be much less blatant.

         The account was suspended, and no I don't have access to users' IP.  I am exploring the reddit admin idea (since yesterday).  Your post is very good and I saw it yesterday.  I would make it an announcement but this twitter thing needs to take precedent for the moment.  I will work on getting it on the sidebar.  Thanks!

        Looks like a disinformation campaign doesn't it. Connect new pizza place with child pornography, write about how CTR goes there eating pizza, seems like bait for the_donald. Whole thing will turn out to be bullshit and then widely reported as one of the dangers of 'fake news'. Meanwhile Comet pizza will be drowned out in rapid media fire and bogus search algorithms. Not sure if this would be enough to stop everything going viral but be prepared for the frontpage plastered with RBI Boston comparisons. Wether a significant majority actually buys into this new thing or not.

        one good thing is that the establishment is playing defense at this point, whereas before, the establishment was able to dictate the topics of conversation.
       </p>
       <p>
        for example, they run a fake news story Sandy Hook, and then follow it up with years of OMG Sandy Hook propaganda.
       </p>
       <p>
        same with 9/11 and anti-muslim propaganda
       </p>
       <p>
        but today, they are resorting to this kind of behavior in reaction to what we are doing online. since they no longer control the topic of conversation, they try to control how that topic is framed within the discussion.
       </p>
       <p>
        unfortunately for them, this will only serve to draw more people into the conversation who were not listening previously.
       </p>
       <p>
        when they are forced to play defense, they don't have as much time to plan, and will make more mistakes, and at the same time internet sleuths are getting more numerous and resourceful, and so will therefore find and exploit those mistakes.
       </p>
       <p>
        it won't be long before #TwitterGate is trending. that will certainly draw in a completely new audience who was curious about the "twitter" part of "twitter gate".

       I'm pretty sure one of them was the bearnaiserestaurant.com. The other one also had pizza in the url but I can't find it now.

     It's ironic, how could he post CP and then say "ha! It's just a prank to show how gullible they are!"
    </p>
    <p>
     No it shows that you're a sick bastard who is now guilty of distributing CP.

    Y'all, I don't know that this Daily Beast author is behind what happened yesterday, but it is interesting that they posted this article last night, which mentions trolling 4chan regarding We the Pizza on a previous occasion. Perhaps the point is muddying the waters regarding yesterday's incident? Quote:
   </p>
   <p>
    "For one, I found out that Correct The Record, a pro-Clinton super PAC that intends to “correct the record on Hillary” on Reddit and Twitter had a Slack chatroom—but it was CorrectRecord. CorrectTheRecord wasn’t taken.
   </p>
   <p>
    So I took it. I signed up a bunch of users, created 4 personalities, and had a chat about hunting and (maybe) killing meme thought-leaders on 4chan and Reddit. I had been looking in the public financials for a pay-out to something that looked shady and I didn’t find anything—but I wound up using first-initial/last names of real people who were paid by Correct The Record and people were able to figure it out.
   </p>
   <p>
    I also had the analysts arguing about not wanting more lunch from We The Pizza, a real pizza place from which Correct The Record had frequently ordered. When internet sleuths googled We The Pizza, they were stunned to discover it was a real place in the middle of Washington, D.C.—just down the street from CTR’s offices!
To 4chan, this was all the proof some users needed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another CTR “document” went super viral when I created a how-to-troll memo that had specific insults to be hurled at Trump supporters. This included “poll flogging”—which I thought was a clearly obvious euphemism—but I didn’t see anyone call it out—wherein CTR paid trolls would “fling” polls at Trumpsters showing him losing in order to demoralize them.
   </p>
   <p>
    This caught fire and people felt that “HEY! That happened to ME! It must be paid trolling.”
   </p>
   <p>
    It’s not paid trolling. It’s just people who disagree with you on the internet.At the end of the day, did this change anything? I don’t know. I think I inadvertently hurt WikiLeaks, which I’m not proud of—but I’m not too sorry about either...."

     What a complete and utter sewer dwelling douchebag. MARCO CHACON is not sorry about hurting an organization who through their leaks have helped expose corruption and horrible crimes committed against children..?
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, this piece of rotting garbage MARCO CHACON is probably gonna be real sorry now that he is boasting about his douchebaggery in public so we all know his name, MARCO CHACON.
    </p>
    <p>
     You will be remembered, MARCO CHACON.

    I don't see any link to the 2 GB hacker on the article.  They just referenced We The Pizza from a previous time involving the podesta emails.

     Yeah I know. Read my comment. The publishing of the article is, I think, related, to discredit the hack, and his claim to previous trolling may be fake too.

    Alright...since trolling is the case I don't see any other reason to hold on to this information. Yesterday I answered two posts that were asking for summaries of both the whole #PizzaGate thing going on and the whole We the Pizza hackers that appeared yesterday. Here are the links to the summaries I posted for those threads and the another post of mine that is referenced in the message below:
   </p>
   <p>
    https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e23fb/can_someone_give_me_a_basic_summary_of_pizzagate/?st=ivsc136y&amp;sh=8d5dbc5e
   </p>
   <p>

   </p>
   <p>
    https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e2na7/how_fast_is_this_sub_growing/?st=ivsc8izq&amp;sh=0e51a2cb
   </p>
   <p>
    After I posted those someone sent me a message non publically and I want to show you guys the message, but before that I will give a disclaimer:
   </p>
   <p>
    I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS, I THINK IT WAS GENUINE TROLLING, THIS IS PROBABLY ANOTHER TRICK AND YOU SHOULD JUST IGNORE IT, I JUST WANTED TO SHARE. So, here you go, message start:
   </p>
   <p>
    "Something big happened a few hours ago, either an attempt to troll this reddit or a genuine lead, it gave it a boost in subs, but it has slowed down a little bit."
btw nice summary of today's events. You might be referring to a post by Pizza guy #2, which lead to a firestorm of responses demanding proof before it was deleted:
"Guy#2 from We The Pizza hack here again... WE BOTH got locked out of our accounts for no reason and we have a list of November's clients thanks to a special somebody who found the private PGP key. Since neither of us can login (can anybody tell us why our accounts were banned???), we cannot prove our identity. Anyway, here is this month's list:
   </p>
   <p>
    Jake Sullivan
   </p>
   <p>
    Joel Benenson
   </p>
   <p>
    Robby Mook
   </p>
   <p>
    Jim Margolis
   </p>
   <p>
    John Podesta
   </p>
   <p>
    Marlon Marshall
   </p>
   <p>
    We think we have proof, after reviewing the newer child rape tapes we believe John Podesta is brutally raping a toddler. It looks just like him, he even talks a little in the video. Proving the validity of a hack is hard and you guys are not making this easy you ungrateful motherfuckers. ;) WE ARE NOT PROS AT THIS!
Also, we are well aware the PDF pricing guide look... homemade. That is why we were kind of worried about releasing it... because it looks like bullshit. And we knew if we released it you would think that.
Please try and remember we really ARE on your side. So please for the love of god stop with baseless accusations. Please consider we might or might not have somebody working inside. Please consider we have no one inside, and we broke in last night without the help of a 3 letter agent or we trained a fucking chimpanzee to do it. Please consider all possibilities about our operation. We are feeding you misinformation about everything from our activities to the date, BUT NEVER ABOUT ACTUAL FACTS. If you ever doubt us, please remember We The Pizza took their site offline less then 2 hours after we posted the child rape photos. We are legit."
   </p>
   <p>
    Message End.
   </p>
   <p>
    Again, guys, I believe they are still trolling, because there are things that do not fit the description of actual people with experience in the reddit, such as how that short of a encryption would only wield a result of 20 characters and this should probably be ignored, I did not post this because I figured they were simply trying to keep posting their crap through me after being banned. I also contacted the mods right away, only one replied to me and  advised me not to make a post about it since the person was banned and wasn't trusted.

      Well, I kept the part where I shit my pants when I saw Podesta's name in there out and how me being directly contacted by this fellow could endanger me...so I deleted that account...yeah I got trolled into deletion. Anyways...nah, I think it's good enough to leave it here. Probably another trick.

      No, I contacted the Mods, only one replied to me. He advised to be skeptical and to not just go around posting things. I agreed, like I said, probably a trick to continue their sham through some random fool.

    Hold your fire. Daily Beast writer wasn't involved with the hoaxes yesterday, or doesn't claim to be. He was involved in a fake Slack chat where he brought up We The Pizza to throw anon investigators off the trail.

    I think you've got the wrong troll.

    I mean... you guys are taking the piss out of this guy, but i've firsthand seen hundreds of people share the stories he outright admits he 100% faked on realtruenews.org.  I've had people say they're gonna fly from america to fight me over arguments about whether or not that shit was true.... He may be a dick, but he's telling the truth

    The first part reads a lot like the Trust Me, I'm Lying by Ryan Holiday, a confession book by a former marketing professional who planted fake stories in the media.
