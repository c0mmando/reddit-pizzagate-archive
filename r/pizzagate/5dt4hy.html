    I know this isn't productive in the investigating but I've been spending all day on this sub. Im a lurker I've never posted. I don't really know where to begin to contribute but I want too. I keep up with everything that's going on and it scares me.I Cant sleep at night thinking about it. If you guys Cant point me in the right direction on how to directly contribute to this cause let me know. Im willing to be all hands on deck to expose the truth about these disgusting people that somehow manage to become elites. I hate it. I hate that they can be "above the law" and I want to change it.

    Sifting through emails and following leads others provide. Just search, search, dig, dig. That's pretty much how it goes. Shovel work. Get yourself some whisky for bedtime.

    I got like that first but pretty much the best thing you can do is help raise awareness because if the whole world is aware the fucking USA has all this underground satanic shit ruling the world they cant do anything but do something. You might not realise it but we are in the middle of a second American revolution

     I too agree we are in the middle of a revolution. And it is bigger than me. I want to be a part of this.

      Don't get seen, and if you do, pretend not to notice them staring. If someone confronts you, just hand them a pamphlet with a smile and walk away.

      That's the price of this. Its not going to be comfortable to change things. But hopefully we'll continue to do the right thing even if it is going to be difficult.

    Google private investigators and call them. Tell them about pizzagate. Send tips to independent journalists and authors of relevant books.

    I hate that they're above the law aswell, and the fact people say "1% of the world owns 99% of the wealth"...yeah, so why haven't we done anything about it for so long?!
   </p>
   <p>
    There's always been more of us than them but the majority just carry on living their lives thinking this is as good as its going to get and they have to put up with it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sure it won't be easy but hopefully this pizzagate scandal will show the people how sick these bastards are and provoke them to rise up.

     I think a lot of this has to do with the silent majority. We need to no longer be silence but I don't know sometimes I feel like just posting on a subreddit itsnt going to do much ya feel. Like there needs to be something more we can do. There needs to be a way to make this bigger than just here and 4chan. That's what I mean.

     I understand. Leo the news uptop let the discussions be on the bottom. I've already started sending emails out to conservative news sites and anchors that would most likely be willing to check out the sub and put this on a national level.

      As far as this goes, find solace in that you're a relative small fry. It's not worth their money, time, or effort to hunt you down. For them to round up everyone who knows about and has investigated pizzagate would make a much bigger scandal than what they have on their hands right now.
     </p>

      Also, melatonin can be helpful, but meditation is what puts me to sleep at night. It can be incredibly hard to start, but it gets easier and easier with every session per day you put into it. Having ADD/ADHD probably makes it harder, I wouldn't know though.

    Also remember the remaining "good guys" at the FBI are leaving bread crumbs for us as well.  Check the vault often and many times things are left but hidden. "In plain sight".  Another way you can help sounds silly but may be their worst fear.  Simply think about what is going on, and how you want this current reality to change.  If enough minds do this, we can manifest change.  Think of the occult this way.  [Remember- the occult is simply anything supernatural or not understood.  Good and bad.  So seeing as how elites back to the beginning of time have been so interested, proves the validity in a sense. As if it were all hooey, it would have been cast out and not bothered with millennia ago.  Collective consciousness for good is a real thing.  That is why we get so "scorned' when talking about it.  I don't pretend to know everything about the universe and how it works, but I'm damn sure if there is a small chance my thinking about this being exposed will help then count me in! [There was a study done in the 90s where 7k people meditated for good, and the global terror and violence went down over 70 percent]

    So at the very least THINK about it! [no pun intended]

    OH- BUT IF YOU DO DECIDE TO DIG - make sure you use a good vpn (virtual private network) and other things (search startpage.com "how to remain completely anonymous online") so you are not putting a target on you or your family.  We don't need any more 2 bullets to the noggin suicides.

    Stay safe!

     I have a good working sense of VPNs and proxy severs.  Used to be big into ToR. And trust me I don't delve deep into anything unless I know Im secure. Constantly changing my IP address. And I don't want to "shoot myself twice in the back of head"

      It's helpful to search online for news articles related to different people you find who are in some way already connected to Pizzagate. Especially, in my opinion, people who are connected via the Wikileaks emails, since that provides a direct link to Clinton's team.

      This is the finest occasion to utilize the Google Fu powers you've been training the past 15 years.

      Find a lead, follow it until it ends, trace it back and start on a different branch.

      Connect people through money, donations, favors, court cases. View the various "crazy maps" for inspiration, try to draw new lines that haven't been found on it yet. There's a few software suites that have been mentioned on this sub, I think http://pizzagate.herokuapp.com is one.

    I know it's difficult to start.  What I'm doing is picking a place-Netherlands- and researching big pedo rings there.  Then I spread out from there and try to track back to CF or US.  Several avenues haven't panned out, but it's given me a feel for how things work.  You could pick a country, your own city or state, or a company to investigate.  Or pick a segment of the CF and research its people and connections.  I've looked into Wikileaks so much over the past month I just couldn't search it again for a week or so.  But picking a person from the leaks and trying to tie them into the rings would also be good.
