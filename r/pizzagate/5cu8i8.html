    Fact is, every day that passes is another day that countless children are being kidnapped, abused, tortured, and maybe even murdered at the hands of these sick pedophiles. As easy as it is to hunt down pedo symbols and discover more disgusting photographs... we need SOLID PROOF - circumstantial evidence is not enough.
   </p>
   <p>
    We can pull all of the circumstantial evidence we want out of our asses but the bottom line is that there will be no justice without 100% solid proof. There's a great chance that we can find our smoking gun by following the money. We now know that George Soros gave a large amount to Comet Ping Pong. We know that the Clinton Foundation is corrupt, and that Hillary Clinton has ties with Comet Ping Pong (not to mention the many other bad ties she has). We know that art galleries (at the very least) are potential ways that the criminals are laundering money.
   </p>
   <p>
    Many of us need to redirect our investigative efforts into following the money. Just remember - the longer it takes for us to bring justice, the longer all of these innocent children will be subject to a living hell. Keep up the great work everyone - and if you have any leads on where people can start looking in order to follow the money, post them here.

    It's difficult. If we could subpoena bank records we'd probably already have them, but none of that stuff can happen until after inauguration. FeelsBadMan

     If only there was an organization who was paid to do this kind of thing.
