   <strong>
    Plea to CTR, Shills, Agents, etc
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    As to not have this thread locked, I'm not here to witch-hunt.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is a plea to anyone working as an agent, bot, shill, etc. By all indication, if you are here, you are probably working for a 3rd party contractor to steer the conversation in this subreddit. We know it happened in /WikiLeaks, and I think it has happened here - but let's leave that discussion out of it, so this thread doesn't get locked.
   </p>
   <p>
    The plea is this: If you are working on this - ask yourself - are you willing to defend pedophelia? When the truth comes out, YOU will be responsible. We WILL prosecute you. You WILL go to jail. Think about your morals. Think about your siblings, think about your loved ones. Would you protect the children you care about? If so, you need to stop representing the companies that are hiring you.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you are an analyst, or experienced developer/network ops, who's is only doing this for the money - I guarantee I can pay you more, to work on, you know, normal projects.
   </p>
   <p>
    If this thread is locked - you will all be able to look at the pattern. They will likely have the last comment, and lock it right away before I can reply - that has been the pattern.

    Most of them are sociopaths who don't have a conscience by default. After all, 1 in 25 people are sociopaths. All they care about is themselves. Maybe some will quit with the fear of jail, but that's about the only reason they will stop and find something else to meddle in.

     Good point. I'm trying to appeal to the ones who aren't sociopaths. Either way, we WILL put them in prison.

    Re-posting a comment i just made in another thread about these people.
   </p>
   <p>
    We also need to keep in mind the other sides (shillls, ctr..) next phase in this subreddit.
   </p>
   <p>
    -At the beginning they shit posted as much garbage as possible to confuse,
   </p>
   <p>
    -next came the divide and conquer, they tried to make it about Politics (left vs right) Religion, Satanism etc
   </p>
   <p>
    -then came in some damage control from minor players accused, obviously using every argumentative fallacy known to man trying to defend themselves.
   </p>
   <p>
    Next...im not sure. But if you pay attention you can start noticing patterns.
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit. If people start reading this some other immediate concerning points. Do we have any recent Julian Assange proof of life? I mean like him on his balcony in public..

     The real trick is just to become aware of their talking points, and tell others about their talking points.
    </p>
    <p>
     They've used 3 distinct communication strategies so far. They are now using a moderate style "become friends" with thought leaders, strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just pass the info along.
    </p>
    <p>
     As far as the proof of life is concerned - You will know if  we get it, it will be shouted from the roof tops. If you have to ask, no, it has not been provided.

    Good point pixie but I doubt shill are willing to let the world know of there plans. Honestly I wish they would stop, they are stoping the world from knowing about this! The children need to be saved. We need to end this shit ASAP
