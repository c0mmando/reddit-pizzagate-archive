<strong>Is anyone concerned about being doxxed or hacked for discussing this publicly?</strong>
<p><p>Is this a valid concern? Couldn't the NSA easily discover your identity via reddit? It's early enough in the discovery phase where they could frame you simply for talking about this shit. </p></p>

<p><p>Nope not at all. I'm a mother of 5 children and absolutely disgusted that Twitter is letting CP rampant on 1000+ accounts while shutting down Trump supporter accounts. FBI or NSA needs to step in and help these little children. Burn it down! #LittleLivesMatter </p></p>

<p><p>FBI is the largest distributor of CP on the internet. They actively post CP in hopes of entrapping others. Comey is in charge of the FBI. DO NOT TRUST THEM. All this talk of "agents being for the people" is nonsense. An organization is compromised when the leader(s) no longer fulfills his duties.</p></p>

<p><p>Nope. Most of what I do here is obtained through Google or Facebook searches and is therefore part of the public record and completely up for discussion and review. They're catching on though and beginning to wipe relevant google caches out of existence. Ran into one earlier when I broke a lead in another thread.</p></p>

<p><p>Don't be a puss. </p>
<p>No point in living your life in fear.  That's what these fucks want. For you to be afraid of what they might do. </p>
<p>Fuck off with that.  Strap on your goddamn old  cowboy balls and spurs and act like a goddam    American.</p></p>

<p><p>For you guys, yeah. For me, I'm good. Sure I get lippy but I'm just keeping track of what other people dig up and keep a healthy skepticism. </p>
<p>I know better than to click the links ya'll have been verifying, and the sub is too big to go after every user.</p></p>

<p><p>Only from the POV that I don't want to be identifiable so use VPN. But let's face it, if someone really wanted to know, they'd find out. People hack the FBI website, it can't be difficult to pinpoint individuals just by digging through post history etc to give an idea. </p></p>
