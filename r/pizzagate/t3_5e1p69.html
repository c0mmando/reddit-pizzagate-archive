        <strong>Developers of Sunnyside Rest Gp. sites. - ASI and LeapLogic</strong>
        <p><p>Another branch of items to consider is who created the websites that represent Sunnyside Restaurant Group (sunnysiderestaurantgroup.com; goodstuffeatery.com; wethepizza.com; bearnaiserestaurant.com). Originally, ASI Software and Web Solutions created it (asisoftware.net/we-the-pizza). Press release pdf is floating around on that page, too. According to the most recent jump back in the Wayback Machine, WTP showed that it was created by Leap Logic. Both ASI and Leap Logic are Birmingham-based, even using the same physical address and suite number. John Thomas is founder/president of ASI and Michael Thomas is a developer per their Contact page. Michael Thomas is the founder and Operations Director of Leap Logic.</p>
<p>ASI initially specialized in inventory software for cars with the WTP site being one of the initial instances of branching out their business. Leap Logic is a web development studio. Did they create the login page and help protect info behind the login? Hmmm.</p></p>

        <p><p>Created throwaway, the only logical decision when posting information you don't want connected with your main account, especially since it's in the sidebar. It's k, I'll keep digging.</p></p>

        <p><p>K. Keep using the same computer, with the same IP, coming from the same MAC, with the same browser fingerprint, with the same cookies. </p>
<p>Learn how to computer, noob. </p>
<p>This is distraction and trying to push people into the weeds knowing there's no result. </p></p>

        <p><p>Might as well look into the brand of phone he has, it's obviously used for nefarious actions and worth looking into! Look into their employees, too! </p>
<p>Stay focused. stay on the Podesta content and keep digging there. I've said it several times, but  to me, WTP is distraction.  I'm happy to be wrong if I am, but I'm not buying this. </p></p>

        <p><p>I get what you're saying. That content is likely what will provide the most direct link. Thank you.</p></p>
