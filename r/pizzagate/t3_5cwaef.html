        <strong>[Useful tool] HHTrack, for saving websites for offline use.</strong>
        <p><p>First of all, I'm not affiliated to HHTrack in any way, shape or form. </p>
<p>This tool saves websites for them to be able to be view offline. This is really useful, since <em>even archive.org and similar websites are failing to do the trick</em>.</p>
<p>Don't let the evidence get destroyed, <strong>save everything</strong>. Let's bring this people down together with heaps of proof.</p>
