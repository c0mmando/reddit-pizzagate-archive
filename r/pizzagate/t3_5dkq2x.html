        <strong>Just discovered this subreddit and I am a bit overwhelmed.</strong>
        <p><p>I read up on some of the summaries and suggested reading around the sub and I am a bit overwhelmed by all of this. Why in the world would high ranking politicians actually be engaged in satanic rituals (Real or mock)? Like that seems so ridiculous to me that people are actually believing that Hillary or other politicians would actually dress up in robes, chant with candles, and sacrifice shit. Not saying it's not true but it just seems really odd to me. Why has not a single person before now exposed these rings? Out of all of these politicians none of them have slipped up and exposed everything going on? Sorry if this post is stupid, I'm just trying to figure out this whole thing. It's a lot to take in. Is the Illuminati real? Like actually real? </p></p>

        <p><p>The occult part originates from the spirit cooking, and /pol/'s natural obsession with the idea that the world leaders are part of some massive conspiracy cult.</p>
<p>Step away from the occult and look just at the pedophile angle.  Just look at the weird language that the Podesta's use in their email, especially the sleeping partner email.  Then start to examine their weird artwork, and the Heavy Breathing videos that have been linked and posted.</p>
<p>The occult stuff is most likely part of their post-modern screen they use to make people uncomfortable enough to not stick around.  If you're gonna hide in the open, best to make sure no one can casually look at you without being made uncomfortable by the very nature. </p>
<p>Do your own research, the pedo angle and Clinton-human-trafficking connections are the strongest we have, the occult is the weakest.</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm a mod here and honestly to answer your question I think after this election the American people/the world are in the dark to what our government does. I believe there is some sort of secret organization, might not be called the Illuminati but there definetly is some sort of fraternal order of such that they belong too.... If you're into the idea look into Bohemian grove and the  Bilderberg group. What's weird is with most large pedophilia and child trafficking rings uncovered there always seems to be a coverup. Just go look up all the pedophilia rings that were uncovered with government officials in western civilization and you'll notice a startling trend of cover up after cover up. </p></p>

        <p><p>I've come to the realization the Illuminati is real, and it's network is quite vast, more so than people realize.  These are rituals that have gone on for thousands of years.  </p></p>

        <p><p>They call themselves Existentialists (as far as I can tell) not the Illuminati. Existentialist is another code phrase for them.</p>
<p>So... for example when you see "existentialist" in a podesta or stratfor email, you now know what you are looking at. </p>
<p>Here's an example in a stratfor "dinner" email;
https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/28/289346_re-sunday-dinner-.html </p>
<p>You can see how the term in used in this context; And yes I am very aware of existentialist philosophy. If you want to hear about the term existentialist as a code for this group however you can also listen to the Kay Griggs interview. </p>
<p>""""How I got involved was an invitation from buddy Jay Ogilvy, whom I
mentioned was a professor of existentialist philosophy at Yale who 30
years ago went to Stanford and eventually became a business consultant. He
is on the Esalen board. He is a fellow futurist, but in the realm of
scenario planning. Along with Stewart Brand of "Clock of the Long Now"
fame and the "Whole Earth Catalog" of the 1970s, Jay founded the Global
Business Network in San Francisco more than 20 years ago. At www.GBN.com.
I think you would find some of their work fascinating, if you are not
familiar. """</p></p>

        <p><p>You don't have exactly the correct idea about what is meant here by :satanism", what you are describing is a halloween/hollywood version of the reality. I know hearing that the occult is embraced by public officials is daunting but i urge you to go through the evidence, both in this investigation and the many whistleblowers who have come out through the years.</p>
<p>Yes, they are involved (globally) in a belief system that could be called a lot of things but saying it''s devilish business is accurate enough. That belief system includes abusing kids. </p>
<p>This is not a modern phenomenon either. It's very old and so entrenched and steeped in secrecy that only a fringe of society pays attention, at least until now. </p>
<p>So don't go blue pilling just yet. Keep your mind open. Reality sometimes comes crashing down like a brick on your head.</p></p>

        <p><p>It is real. You just pulled on a loose thread... keep pulling.</p>
<p>It has come out in our faces MANY times in our country and others. Start with the FRANKLin cover up. Look at these sources yourself. You will find after all the evidence that... as hard as it is to believe it will be easier than believing that all 800 coincidences are just that... or easier to believe than this being the most elaborate hoax ever pulled in mankind....</p>
<p>Trust me it's all there for you to uncover.</p></p>

        <p><p>It seems ridiculous when you look at it from the top down.</p>
<p>Start from readily available public info and draw your own conclusions.
David Brock was blackmailed by Alefantis (owner of comet ping pong) for 850k for who knows what.  That's a lot of money.
David Brock is the head of Media Matters.
Alefantis had a very public instagram with lots of creepy photos of kids and blatant comments about pedophilia on them. (he has since made this private)
Podesta's brother (and likely JP too) have attended "Spirit cooking" dinners with Marina A.  JP at least Knows her (this is revealed in the wikileaks)
J Podesta has a lot of odd references to pizza in his emails and some are unexplainable "a pizza related map" on a handkerchief?
They are all acquainted with Alefantis.
J Podesta and his brother both have super creepy art collections, some of which depict child abuse (wapo since deleted the article but it's been archived).<br>
All of the businesses on that street are owned by Clinton related/supporters.
besta pizza a few doors down had a very blatant pedo symbol for their logo (changed just a few days ago).<br>
Hillary clinton mentioned "the Minerva rule" and the Owl in her emails.<br>
Jeffery Epstein is a convicted child molester and has had clinton on his plane something like 18 times and taken him to is island where they have a fucking pagan temple with OWLS on it: https://i.redd.it/2vugqypz4bvx.png
Numerous associated websites to Comet have all kinds of pedo stuff on them.  The band Heavy Breathing who plays at Comet has a bunch of pedo symbolism in their "art".  There are super creepy murals and photos all over Comet...
I could go on and on.  Draw your own conclusion as to what's happening...</p></p>

        <p><p>I appreciate your concise list of known facts. No need for conjecture (although there is a place for that) to reasonably conclude that some high ranking govt officials are pedophiles and operate in concert. </p>
<p>Plus some sort of satanic/voodoo inspired rituals are being performed either out of sheer boredom or more likely in order to bring good luck, favor from some pagan god or force.  One thing that has occurred to me...a lot of the spirit cooking events coincide with the launching of a campaign or the approaching election.  </p>
<p>I just pray that the hints of abuse, torture, or worse of children turns out to be some strange sick fantasy world and not reality.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Watch Ted Fungerson's (former FBI director off Los Angeles Department) speech about the pedophilia rings among high ranking elites. He claims that his investigations were disrupted by the upper rankers at all costs. He even exclaimed that a building that he suspected was being used for these satanic rituals was investigated by an accompanying archeologist, who had found traces of an underground basement (which was covered in cement by the time of investigation).</p>
<p>Found it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju_jWWIS_hE</p>
