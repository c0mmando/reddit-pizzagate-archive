        <strong>Someone should look into the pedophilic artwork of this woman called Kim Noble (a.k.a. Ria Pratt)</strong>
        <p><p>This has been posted before but I think there might be a clue here since these pedo scumbags are really into "art". This woman has horrifying paintings that has writings on them such as "PRATT WAS HERE" or "WILL KILL US" etc. The woman most likely was an abused child and then she developed a multi personality disorder and one of them is this Ria Pratt. I am just leaving two mirrored paintings for reference, when I have some off time I will look into other paintings. And just to clarify, no conspiracy based claims here, just to prevent a possible overlook</p>

        <p><p>I may be wrong, the way you worded the title, it seems you are trying to stir up a witch hunt</p>
<p>she IS a victim, and this is her therapy art</p></p>

        <p><p>I am not a native speaker actually, if the title awakens such a feeling sorry for that. Just wanted to avoid overlooking since these paintings might be somehow related to the topic.</p></p>

        <p><p>She's already been brought into the depths of this. The link people wanted to make initially, aside from the obviously dark content of her Ria Pratt indentity, is her visual use of handkerchiefs in several of her paintings involving child sex crimes.</p>
<p>Certainly worth bringing up again for a visual cue for the types of crimes being investigated.</p></p>
