    There was a lot of suspicion about Jane Tanner at the time.

    I'm guessing if you can miss a couple of hundredthousand pounds (donated) they are well-connected as well?

    edit 1:  wikipedia about the tapas seven:
Tapas Seven
The McCanns were on holiday with seven friends and eight children in all, including the McCanns' three.[25] The nine adults dined together most evenings at 20:30 in the resort's tapas restaurant, as a result of which the media dubbed the friends the Tapas Seven. The group consisted of marketing manager Jane Tanner and her partner, physician Russell O'Brien, who were there with their two children; physician Matthew Oldfield and his wife, recruitment consultant Rachael Oldfield, along with their daughter; and physicians Fiona and David Payne, their two children, and Fiona Payne's mother, Dianne Webster.[26] Jane Tanner became an important witness, when she reported seeing a man carry a young girl away from the resort 50 minutes before Madeleine was reported missing.[27]
