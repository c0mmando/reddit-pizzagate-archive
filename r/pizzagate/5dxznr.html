     This is also why he hung out with Michael Jackson so much and why he idolizes him to this day. MJ was one of the only people powerful enough to protect Corey from wealthy and connected pedophile rapists in Hollywood. This is also why the media spent so much time demonizing him and accusing him of being a child rapist himself.

         What's worse? That he was assassinated, or that he died from abusing painkillers to hide from the pain of his own abuse?

           Looking at the
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_v._Murray">
            wikipedia entry
           </a>
           . It's weird.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Murray's defense counsel (Edward Chernoff, Matthew Alford, J. Michael Flanagan and Nareg Gourjian) claimed Jackson, who was tired and under pressure from rehearsing, took eight tablets of lorazepam (Ativan), a sedative. "When Dr. Murray left the room, Jackson self-administered a dose of propofol that, with the lorazepam, created a perfect storm in his body that killed him instantly. The whole thing is tragic, but the evidence is not that Dr. Murray did it", Chernoff said.[3] Testimony during the trial showed Murray stayed with Jackson at least six nights a week and was regularly asked—and sometimes begged—by the insomniac singer to give him drugs powerful enough to put him to sleep.

       It also makes sense why MJ was so careful with his own children, shielding them from the public eye and even covering up their faces on the rare occasions they went out. People thought he was crazy but he was literally trying to protect them from the pedophiles getting their hands on them

         Man, yeah... As crazy and creepy as he seemed, I just never got that vibe from him. I guess the moral I have recently learned is that you never know, but also I have learned to trust my gut... Too many cards stacked against MJ.

       Because they don't have to look a crying child in the eyes and tell them how fucked up they are due to anonymity. Much like how pedophiles hide in the shadows.

       Because making jokes about tragedies takes the poison out of them. Which is why 9/11 jokes are so popular.

        9/11 jokes weren't funny or helpful at the time though. The thing about child abuse, rape etc. is that they're basically always happening which is why humour doesn't work well for them - you're still mocking current victims.

         But the thing about child abuse is that it isn't a huge event that happened to a large population at one given moment. It's an ongoing problem, however you have to think of it like this, when people make 9/11 jokes they aren't making fun of the people who died. They're taking the offense and hurt out of the topic and replacing it with laughter. At the same time, people remember it is a serious and horrible event. The same goes for things like pedophilia and rape. The topics are joked about to take the harshness away because if we only keep everything as negative as it is then life is more depressing. Which is why comedians love to use material on sensitive subjects and tragedies.

        If youbwant levity, go somewhere epse. This is not a joking matter. And at the risk of getting this post removed, I really want to call everyone who thought this was funny really fucking dumb. Borderline tragic lives you are living by thinking that is funny. Go watch the new season of Walking Dead for some more laughs...

    Something definitely happened here... Why would such a popular person with so much to lose simply make this up?
   </p>
   <p>
    ... More importantly, why would he recant his story almost immediately when people started asking the right questions? Perhaps he was worried about the eye of Sauron...

      Yeah, pretty sure he's been bringing this topic up for a while. As far as I know, people assumed something happened to him when it didn't. He just thinks it's an important topic, it's not that it directly affected him.

     I guess they were too freaky and far apart to be taken seriously.

    They're spinning his words. He was asked about Saville and he said "it's probably still happening". Here's what he said on twitter after article was posted
   </p>
   <p>
    "The Sunday Times interviewed me about my latest film but the story became about something else entirely. It prompted a number of false and misleading headlines. I had just seen a powerful documentary and I briefly spoke with the reporter about the subject which had consequences I did not intend or expect. Lesson learned. Let me be clear: This subject of child abuse is an important one that should be discussed and properly investigated. But as I made absolutely clear to the writer, I have no first hand experience or observation of the topic, so I cannot speak with any authority beyond articles I have read and films I have seen."

     Thank you. I strongly believe there's something tragic going on amongst the elite, but this sub is so prone to jumping to conclusions based off of the tiniest line that might indicate something along the lines of pedophilia.

    "AN OPEN SECRET looks at the lives of children betrayed and abandoned by a system that essentially funnels them towards sexual predators without any oversight or regard for their safety. It documents not only these young peoples' experiences, but also how some have emerged stronger for their speaking out. It beg the questions of why children working in entertainment aren't afforded the same protections they are afforded at school, and argues for more effective treatment and stronger penalties for child sex offenders."

     The only problem with this film is that it only details these crimes committed by very small-time/amateurish figures in what could hardly even be called the "film industry." I'm phenomenally more curious about the likely mountain of evidence against actual top, household-name Hollywood figures.

      The film does mention Bryan Singer quite a lot, although after the film was first released all lawsuits against him were dropped due to a settlement being reached. The film was re-edited to take out most of the Singer-related stuff.

      He is a pretty big name - XMen and various others.

       Yep - seems to work - btw I saw the version that's like 1.5 or 2 hrs long and this is a little over 3 hrs. Is it a lot of extra interview footage?

    One observation-when the story about Feldman and Haim et al started to get a little bit of traction,  the Cosby story broke and was fed, pumped and blown into a storm by the media as it dropped the pedo story like a rock.

    This is from May and he has already clarified this statement.  He said ""The Sunday Times interviewed me about my latest film but the story became about something else entirely. It prompted a number of false and misleading headlines. I had just seen a powerful documentary and I briefly spoke with the reporter about the subject which had consequences I did not intend or expect. Lesson learned. Let me be clear: This subject of child abuse is an important one that should be discussed and properly investigated. But as I made absolutely clear to the writer, I have no first hand experience or observation of the topic, so I cannot speak with any authority beyond articles I have read and films I have seen."

   <p>
    You are doing nothing but spreading the clickbait-y headlines that he is referring to - totally spinning his words.  Not cool

     Because the Podesta emails are FULL of people talking about 'cheese pizza' and what they can do to it/when they can get it/spending thousands and thousands of dollars on it. It's a well documented fact that pedophiles refer to child porn as 'cheese pizza' because of the shared initials.

    The rich and famous know that they can do whatever they want, and they won't get in trouble for it. If a victim speaks up, they aren't listened to, or aren't believed. Famous friends will help each other cover up their crimes.

    Am I the only person that thinks all of these puzzle pieces go to the same puzzle?
   </p>
   <p>
    This is giving credibility to some other conspiracies. Which ones are valid, which ones fit?
   </p>
   <p>
    We know a cult has gained a huge amount of influence over multiple governments.
   </p>
   <p>
    What kind of cult?
   </p>
   <p>
    One involved in pedofilia, child trafficking, and spirit cooking.
   </p>
   <p>
    The numbers of the child trafficking is huge.
   </p>
   <p>
    Where are these children going?
   </p>
   <p>
    Why do they need a constant supply?
   </p>
   <p>
    Ritual murder or sacrifice? Possibly canabalism?
   </p>
   <p>
    They have to dispose of the evidence some how. What makes sense?
   </p>
   <p>
    Possibilities: buried, acid vats, canabalism?
   </p>
   <p>
    The kuru conspiracy has been fluttering around. Depending on the age of the cult, what methods could its rituals use?
   </p>
   <p>
    This particular post, credible or not, makes me think. http://imgur.com/I3GjI7a
   </p>
   <p>
    A very old cannibalistic murder sacrifice cult. Is this the simplest answer? Is this Occums razor? (Need to check spelling)
   </p>
   <p>
    Is it possible to believe that people like this really exist?
   </p>
   <p>
    After watching this video I choose to believe that they do and there are probably more than one. https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=Ygc5kDyoJFM
   </p>
   <p>
    I could be very, very wrong. I could also be right. If I'm wrong, and I waste a bunch of my time trying to figure out how to stop an international cult that doesn't exist, that's fine. If I'm right, then we aren't thinking about this whole thing the right way.
   </p>
   <p>
    I keep pointing people to this interview: https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=fnrBQqxRV7c
   </p>
   <p>
    He explains a lot of what we are dealing with.
   </p>
   <p>
    People not believing. A self sustaining rot in the system. Degradation of education.
   </p>
   <p>
    NO CLEAR PATH TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY, COMMUNITY, OR COUNTRY.
   </p>
   <p>
    Think of all the ways we are split.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every effort has it's own merit. Pizzagate. BLM and systemic racism. Trump protests, for or against.
   </p>
   <p>
    Divided.
   </p>
   <p>
    Divide and conquer.
   </p>
   <p>
    Powerful people are betting against the US.
   </p>
   <p>
    Why can't anyone think of the big picture? Everyone is obsessed with one rabbit hole or another. THEY ARE FUCKING CONNECTED.
   </p>
   <p>
    Read this post twice. Actually watch the videos.
   </p>
   <p>
    Everyone is looking for a way to connect the dots. Step back and fuzz your eyes. It's actually a color by number.

     I remember watching that Zeitgeist film probably 10 years ago at least. I'm not sure how credible the information in it is, I only watched it once but I remember clearly how much it opened my eyes to the levels of deeprooted corruption at the very top of our society. I remember distinctly having that switch flipped in my head where I realized that the media was intentionally dividing the country. Realizing that as long as we're so hyperfocused on fighting each other over race, class, sex, gender, religion, etc. etc. we'll never be strong enough to fight the people who are really responsible for these issues.
    </p>
    <p>
     My problem though is, what is the end game? Is it simply to stay in power? People have been talking about the Illuminati and the New World Order since before I was born. Can it really be so simple? The wealthy and powerful are so desperate to maintain that position that they ruin whole countries to keep our eyes off them? Are they planning some controlled "mass genocide" to reduce the world's population to more manageable levels? This is the shit that keeps me awake at night. Just wondering where the shepherds are leading us.

      What's their real end game? Who knows?
     </p>
     <p>
      I bet it doesn't involve you or me.
     </p>
     <p>
      We have a huge advantage though. Sheer numbers. You, me, and everyone else.
     </p>
     <p>
      This is just an information war. A war of ideas. A good idea just needs to be started. It will spread like a mind virus. It can grow exponentially over night.
     </p>
     <p>
      That switch you mentioned? I've had it flipped. So have others. We need to find a way to flip it for everyone else.
     </p>
     <p>
      That's it. Do that and we win.
     </p>
     <p>
      Help me think. It just takes one person. It could be me that figures it out. It could be you. It's so simple.
     </p>
     <p>
      Flip the switch. Flip other people's switches. We are all fighting the same fight. Even if we are opposite sides of the protest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Flip the switch.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ask the people around you: "How can you convince the world?" They will tell you how to flip the switch inside themselves.
     </p>
     <p>
      Flip the switch.
