    I mean this makes the most sense to me. You'd be risking your life but this seems like the thing to do. What worries me is that this sub has already led them to cover up and move their whole operation elsewhere.

    But frankly what you need is feet on the ground as well, if you want to find a smoking gun.

    People have gone there and filmed since the scandal broke. They got kicked out by cops in one video I saw. But obviously if there was anything actually going on at that location, they have way too much heat right now to be actively abusing children there.

     Ugh, we need real investigative journalists. It'd be some illegal shit (So I'm totallllllly not advocating it) like stalking but I think the best thing would be to have some people tail Podesta. He's bound to have his hands in a lot of bad places.

    Yeah, that's what I think. Check the men's room for hidden cameras.

    I always think that someone should simply place a hidden camera on top of the roof across Comet Pizza in order to record everything and check the footage to see if there are any abnormal activities observable on the outside. If someone is going to do these things they're not supposed to announce any of their plans and should probably find a friend to accompany them or be their witness so that they can be safe. Field work should not be rushed.

     Oh yeah for sure, if anyone is doing this they should not announce it except maybe to private trusted friends as life-insurance so if anything happens to them the word will get out.

     Need to find out if other businesses have cameras facing comet, then try to get ahold of the video pre pizza gate. See who's coming and going

      That is a fascinating point, but I don't think that they would hand over such footage to civil investigators and to my knowledge recorded footage is deleted sooner or later (Unless you're the NSA, hah). Police could ask for such footage, however we don't know if they're in on it or not. I'm making assumptions here, but I don't think they'll allow that to happen.
