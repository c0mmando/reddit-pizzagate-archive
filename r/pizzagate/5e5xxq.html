     I saw this video today of a Syrian child being treated for inhaling chlorine gas, and it really hit me hard

    This little boy, all these kids, what they've already been through. If they survive, they could wind up in an orphanage that could be a front to traffic them to sick bastards to be used and discarded. Keep digging everyone. Keep exposing them. You are changing the world right now, and we all have to keep fighting.

    That video has something very fishy/fake-seeming. Why are their multiple cameras there? You can hear the second camera's shutter. And, the baby she took out... she did not support the baby's neck at all and the head did not droop. Extremely skeptical of this video, people are pushing propaganda

     I'm sure if it was propaganda, the filming was done to push the "Russia Evil!" narrative, and the same people who created it now get to watch it motivate the masses to throw them out of power. Karma.

    Trump, like him or not, gave a voice to the voiceless. The people are in charge now. Due Process will be our method of retaliation

     I agree 100%, and I think as more of this comes out, more people will wake up to that. I hope.
