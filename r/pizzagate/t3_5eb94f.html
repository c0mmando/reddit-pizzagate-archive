<p><p>That's stupid. The value and protection of crowd sourcing research is that a multitude of people discover and know the information. Thus making it impossible to stop the message. </p>
<p>You find something you share it. They can spin and derail all they want. Everyone's wise to their tricks. </p></p>

<p><p>For people wandering in from The Donald subreddit: </p>
<p>Be prepared to go down the rabbit hole. Nothing alone is convincing. And each little thing taken alone seems coincidental. It's the entire package which makes it very eerie and quite terrifying. There are definitely pedophilia rings within the government. 
You can go down the rabbit hole here: http://pastebin.com/ZykxjTRL 
But for a quick, and definitely not exhaustive list of the things found as there is way too much:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The children trafficking in Haiti that involves Hillary. [A woman who was investigating these ties to the Clinton Foundation was just found dead last recently] (https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5dbdz9/i_found_a_smoking_gun_monica_petersen_found_dead/).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The largest pedophile ring exposed that was [covered by abc news] (https://truthkings.com/days-recovering-weiner-hard-drive-fbi-makes-large-child-sex-trafficking-raid/) coincidentally after Anthony weiner's laptop was taken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Podesta being [good friends] (https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48488) with known pedophiliacs such as [Dennis Hastert] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hastert), [Epstein] (http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/14/bill-clinton-ditched-secret-service-on-multiple-lo/)..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Podesta's brother, Tony Podesta's affinity for provacative art which includes [statues of Jeffery Dhamer's victim's pose] (https://i.redditmedia.com/MVSZwoVeIFIuUqQhQsshS2J-dpq7EzYc-OucwuFuyTE.png?w=887&amp;s=e4cbddbaeb6432870a4c290ec1da5e91) and young children naked. Tony Podesta is a lobbyist in Washington, and is an employee of the Saudis who also have issues with Child Trafficking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>References to [ Moloch] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch)  ( the god of Children Sacrifices) and [sacrifices of chickens] (https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14333)  found in the Wikileak emails of the DNC staff to Hillary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marina Abromovic and her [spiritcooking] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9ys-Lfu4Sc) which is satanic in nature involving blood, semen, &amp; breast milk along with John Podesta's [invite via email] https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15893).  Marina stated on an AMA that in private dinners, [it's NOT art] (https://i.redditmedia.com/z484j2EbaVB3AEldtwSmeBQ3CQl3Y9ubnJVjGZwVR9M.jpg?w=1024&amp;s=197e25797dd2c4ca4784a0155e574c20).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>References to pedophilia via known [pedo code] (http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cheese%20pizza) in the Podesta emails, such as the [handkerchief pizza/map being left behind] (https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15893).  [Handkerchiefs] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief_code) are used as code for sexual preferences, and victims of pedophilia express that it’s collected as a souvenir after being placed [under the victim] (https://i.sli.mg/kHXqhi.jpg).  Other code words found in the emails like: [playing dominos on pizza or pasta] (https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30613)? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comet Ping Pong found in the Podesta emails in DC which is the restaurant that high officials are tied with [including Hillary] (http://2static.fjcdn.com/pictures/What_0c65a8_6080505.jpg), along with a couple other restaurants nearby with possible pedo connections and galleries where [Hillary is seen] (https://i.sli.mg/xaRHyg.png) and that [Soros along with others donated to (over $20k] (https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bkvaw/soros_has_been_linked_to_comet_ping_pong/).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comet ping’s owner, [James Alefantis] (https://i.sli.mg/h6EHML.jpg)  AKA Jimmy Comet posting disturbing pictures on his instagram such as a [child taped to a ping pong talbe] (https://i.sli.mg/0woG5J.png), marina abromovic, child with money in their mouth, ["Infant Lover" t-shirt] (https://i.sli.mg/wGsp3j.png).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jimmy Comet also posting a picture on his instagram with a [letter that says "Moloch" on it] (http://archive.is/ycEwD). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comet ping pong using disturbing artwork with paintings of pedophilia by victims for their performances, and [paintings of children with their heads cut off] (http://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a1496219441_16.jpg). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comet Ping pong's favorite friend for entertainment, Majestic Ape ([of Heavy Breathing)] (http://heavybreathing.net/a.html), which is an artist that has provocative music with artwork that involves both children and sex (words <a href="http://archive.is/4190H">"All the Chidlren" with babies crawling, and a child with a phallic toy in its mouth</a>, mentions of pedophilia in captions, cartoons of sex artwork). Also listed on [Comet Pingpong’s friends list.] (http://archive.is/Yogml)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comet Ping Pong and [neighboring restaurants] (https://i.sli.mg/bJwpuH.png) having a [pedophilia symbol] (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwmnPagWgAAqHoS.jpg) in their logos (the triangular spiral in the neighboring <a href="http://i.imgur.com/AwvFM1d.jpg">Besta Pizza</a>, the butterfly, the heart).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An abandoned, unknown but verified, [underground tunnel ] (http://jalopnik.com/the-secret-underground-world-of-washington-d-c-1679984312)system that runs right underneath these restaurants and connects them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A [government official] (http://stateofthenation2012.com/?p=57381) commenting on the instagram of comet pizza happens to be involved in convicting pedophiles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Etc.. etc..</p></p>

<p><p>If you want to convince people that it might be possible that theres some high-level pedophile-ring going on, the best way to convince someone would be looking at history:
http://archive.is/20161104012145/pastebin.com/Jn2LfXg4</p>
<p>The text starting from Franklin's case onwards seems like a good list on former rings, and the way that people investigating it seems to disappear.</p>
<p>Also the links to child trafficking/"charity" aka Laura Silsby etc</p>
<p>edit: Depending on the people you want to convince of course. The_Donald has lost all trust on media, so your way might work, but more ordinary people might require another approach.</p></p>

<p><p>Going forward I'd like to see a single change if the community agrees....</p>
<p>We shouldn't call everything gate because people will think it's separate we need to tag # Pizzagate # battleoftwitter</p>
<p>So people see our progress and as more information is revealed they see our movement going forward and having real repercussions.</p>
<p>So let's say we find the same thing on instagram, instead of # instagramgate further separating it we can tag # pizzagate # battleofinstagram
this will associate # pizzagate as what's happening and the battles as sources of pedophilia</p></p>

<p><p>This actually means they are more likely to be compromised.  There were two threads today on Kanye west showing he was put into a hospital after coming out about trump and the lying media and they both got deleted.  This mega thread is being used as an excuse to delete all these threads and say see we told you to talk at the end of the week.  The goal is because Donald is mainstream now they want less of this kind of information there so they are trying to direct it to these lesser known subs.  This is the only way they could start censoring but appear to remain legitimate.</p></p>

<p><p>Ill believe they arent compromised when they unban all of us former the_donald users, that were banned specifically for crossposting from this sub. Until then... u/IFIFIFOKIEDOKE.</p></p>

<p><p>If he said he was going to prosecute her now Obama and Clinton could rush a trial and get a pardon from Obama.  Hopefully king centipede is playing the long game and waiting for Obama to leave before prosecuting her to prevent a pardon from happening.</p></p>
