   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Comet Pizza is a pizza place owned by James Alefantis, who is the former gay boyfriend of David Brock
    </strong>
    , the CEO of Correct The Record. It has been the venue for dozens of events for the Hillary campaign staff. John Podesta has had campaign fundraisers there for both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. John's brother and business partner Tony Podesta has his birthday party there every year.
   </p>
   <p>

   </p>
   <p>
    It's also a dive that according to reviews and photos has hidden bathroom doors and creepy murals. The bathrooms in particular have murals exclusively of nude women, as well as a great deal of graffiti relating to sex. Reviews of the restaurant are bizarrely polarized. Websites describing it positively note that there are regularly "unsupervised children running around". Their menu include a pedophilic symbol, as do the signs and decorations of other neighboring businesses.
   </p>
   <p>
    https://i.sli.mg/7hr0h9.jpg
   </p>
   <p>
    The music acts and the posters promoting same acts are bizarre in their presentation, content, and lyrical focus, but are still promoted as being "for all ages". The overtly sexual content would suggest otherwise.
   </p>
   <p>
    The same has taken place in reference to videos recorded inside Comet Ping Pong by people that frequent their establishment as well as video referencing Comet Ping Pong positively from the exterior.
   </p>
   <p>
    While initially not the central focus of the investigation at the onset, Comet Ping Pong is a much more overt and much more disturbing hub of coincidences. Everyone associated with the business is making semi-overt, semi-tongue-in-cheek, and semi-sarcastic inferences towards sex with minors. The artists that work for and with the business also generate nothing but cultish imagery of disembodiment, blood, beheadings, sex, and of course pizza.

    James Alefantis' instagram late 11/5/16. by morning of 11/7/16 it was set to private.

   <hr/>
   <p>
    We recently found the instagram account of James Alefantis.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Full album:
    </strong>
    https://sli.mg/a/gaffhM
   </p>
   <p>
    The contents of it are indescribably bizarre and the contexts of the posts and comment chains are weird. Alefantis does not have any children nor do his closest associates, but the photos seem to be a near constant assortment of different children of a variety of ages, intermingled between posts about gay bars, clubs, photos of common rape drugs, and piles of foreign currency. After it being trawled through for 24 hours it has been set to private. A large set of archived copies can be seen here in the next section. Similarly the instagram and twitter accounts of Comet Ping Pong are being edited selectively. The accounts of the people favoriting and commenting on these posts are equally bizarre in both content, context, and demeanor.

   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Violent crime prosecution priorities in Greenbelt include using FEDERAL RACKETEERING, CONSPIRACY and firearms statutes to disrupt violent gangs and reduce gang activity. The scope of these gang prosecutions ranges from local to national and INTERNATIONAL.
    </p>
    <p>
     Greenbelt prosecutors also investigate and prosecute SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC CORRUPTION AND FRAUD CASES. Public corruption cases involve state and local government officials and employees of the many federal agencies located in the Southern Division.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like the Major Crimes Section in Baltimore, the Greenbelt office prosecutes a wide array of other federal offenses, including
     <strong>
      CHILD PORNOGRAPHY
     </strong>
     , bank robberies, immigration violations, and counterfeiting.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Southern Division office also handles thousands of misdemeanor cases that occur on areas of exclusive federal jurisdiction such as the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, the National Institutes of Health, and MILITARY BASES."

     Video recorded during Sasha Lord's birthday party at Comet Ping Pong.
    </strong>
    Individual with the microphone wearing a wig and ski mask is Amanda Kleinman (aka Majestic ape). Words used are very strange, video was deleted within an hour of it being found on youtube and had to be archived and reuploaded. She uploaded it a second time (as unlisted) and after a day or two switched it to private. Any remaining copies on youtube are reuploads and may or may not get taken down with DMCA notices.

    In the party video, Amanda Kleinman references "secret pizza". This same term comes up in the description of a film about a "private island" that was
    <strong>
     produced by Jame Alefantis.
    </strong>
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     On a whim, Eve, a young Swedish traveler, accepts an invitation from Peter to vacation on his family's
     <em>
      private island
     </em>
     off the coast of New England. As a series of unexpected delays prevent other guests from arriving, Eve discovers that she has little in common with the increasingly erratic Peter. Gradually the idyllic natural beauty of the island gives way and Eve
     <em>
      finds herself trapped
     </em>
     in a state of surreality punctuated by bizarre visions, dimensional shifting and
     <em>
      secret pizza

    Tony Podesta, John Podesta's brother and the guy who has a "pasta" obsession according to many e-mails did a 3 to 4 month trip to Japan with Dennis Hastert where they both taught students.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     In his first year of graduate school, Hastert spent three months in Japan as part of the People to People Student Ambassador Program.[29] One of Hastert's fellow group members was Tony Podesta (then the president of the Young Democrats at University of Illinois at Chicago Circle).

     They are known for purchasing "awkward" works, such as video installations, that many other private collectors will not consider. "It's easy to store them, but difficult to display them," says Podesta. To get round the problem, he and his wife have excavated a huge subterranean vault beneath their house outside Washington - a white space 5m square and 4m high in which it will be possible to show "very complicated video pieces" on all four walls.

    Child Protective Services Investigation Ends After Suspicious Death Of Lead Investigator
   </h1>

   <p>
    https://archive.fo/mA7TI#selection-1075.0-1185.108
   </p>
   <p>
    Former Georgia State Senator, Nancy Schaefer was an outspoken opponent of Child Protective Services (CPS). Schaefer authored an investigation in which, among other findings, revealed the following:
“…the separation of families is growing as a business because local governments have grown accustomed to having taxpayer dollars to balance their ever-expanding budgets.
The Adoption and the Safe Families Act, set in motion by President Bill Clinton, offered cash “bonuses” to the states for every child they adopted out of foster care. In order to receive the “adoption incentive bonuses” local child protective services need more children. They must have merchandise (children) that sell and you must have plenty of them so the buyer can choose. Some counties are known to give a $4,000 bonus for each child adopted and an additional $2,000 for a “special needs” child.
In this document, Schaefer makes it clear that organizations, such as The Second Mile, procure their underage victims by making children wards of the State. CPS has unchecked legal authority to remove children, with or without cause. Subsequently, CPS and their partners, the corrupt juvenile court judges can place these children wherever they see fit (e.g. The Franklin House, Boys Town, Elm House, The Second Mile Foundation) where unimaginable horrors take place.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Schaefer and her husband died under very mysterious circumstances at their home in Georgia in March of 2010.

    I looked up the property owners on Pakala through the tax assessor's office (someone's paying tax on the property). From the old wifi post, both the property with the concrete pad (577 Pakala) and the wealthy property next door with the building that off-the-book power lines go into (563 Pakala) are both owned by the same organization - B P BISHOP TRUST ESTATE - the wealthiest charity in the state worth $10B and has a 10% stake in Goldman Sachs.
   </p>
   <p>
    In a 3 year period the estate lost an unaccounted for $241 million and operating costs increased by $19 million, maybe accounting for the underground construction. This was in the late 90s though, and the WiFi OP said he was doing construction there recently.

       Yeah this is all totally crazy. James Alefantis is obviously a normal pizza owner and clearly nothing out of the ordinary happens there.

       I mean people are trying to say stuff like
       <a href="http://archive.is/jXWrG">
        this

       is out of the ordinary? Like come on I post content like this all the time, a little #killroom here a little #killroom there.

      What about the Play Eat Drink PED? Its a small piece of art but typically people like this hide shit right under your nose, like hidden artwork on dollar bills, etc.

      Yeah... isn't that what most of the 'evidence' in these conspiracy theories consists of though? Most of that summary image is just a bunch of far-fetched non sequiturs* too.

     I'm not sure why they used this logo to make the case. The one that is disturbing is the pizza logo. It had the pedophile symbol in it. Like, you can't try to squint your  eyes and try and see it. It was blatantly obvious. And as soon as this story came out, they quickly changed their logo to removing the triangle spiral from the inside of the pizza.

      Maybe they changed it so crazy people would stop accusing them of having a pedo symbol in their logo.

       I agree that's a possibility, because it's bad for their business i'm sure. But that doesn't negate the fact that there was a symbol for pedophilia in their logo. It could be a coincidence, but then again, how many coincidences do we need in order to say something is going on here? Each one of these things taken individually isn't convincing, but all together says a lot.

         There is another, which is why I was wondering why they used this ping pong paddle for "convincing" evidence. Because people who see that roll their eyes. THIS one however... is blatant: http://i.imgur.com/AwvFM1d.jpg

          The Comet Ping Pong was the artwork right above pizza on their menu. Since the entire conspiracy is that pizza is related to children or sex, its location above pizza on the menu and 'Play Eat Drink PED' connection make it worth throwing into the rest of the fucked up evidence surrounding these people and places.

     If the Play Eat Drink PED wasn't there I would agree its a stretch... but they put it fight in your face right before the pizza menu.

     I also thought that was a weird image to prove they use pedophile symbolism
    </p>
    <p>
     The pizzeria across the street, however, uses this symbolism: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JNRFTHILY6o/hqdefault.jpg

    I think this has a lot of benign items in it mixed with relevant information.  Be careful that we don't start lumping everything in with the valid.  Nothing hurts the search for truth than muddying the waters with things that don't matter.
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     <p>
      Ping Pong paddles aren't a pedo symbol.  In fact, most of the pedo symbols aren't even symmetrical.  The butterfly is specifically colored and created out of symmetrical hearts.  However, none of the other known symbols are symmetrical.  Sometimes pingpong paddles are just pingpong paddles.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      The artist lady they keep saying was doing a black magic ritual is just that, an artist and she's known for shock art and performance art.  Just because its creepy doesn't mean its evil.
     </p>
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Stop making something out of nothing to keep the glass clear.  Its very likely there is a global pedo ring and Comet Pizza looks disturbing through this lens.  But everything anyone touches or does isn't part of it and treating it like that could be used to cover other truth.

     You do realize that every religion has its own type of art.   There is Christian art.  Catholic art.  Muslim art.   and Satanic art.   Just because it is art does not excuse the satanism.

     This should be common sense I dont see why people struggle with this concept.

      Like I responded to the other person, I don't have any doubts about the Comet Pizza connection to the pedo ring filth.  Its just that every thing you see isn't immediately a clue.  Only one pedo symbol is symmetrical which makes the idea that this being symmetrical is a clue in rather unlikely.  Especially considering how often pingpong paddles are placed like this for actual pingpong events.  I'm not struggling with the concept, the form doesn't fit the patter.  Most pedo symbols are spiral and triangular in nature.

     The Ping Pong paddle layout is symmetrical specifically to the child lover design and has the words Play Eat Drink or PED across the front. Also, since these symbols are documented, it would make sense to change them slightly to go under the radar. Similar to artwork hidden on dollar bills or corporate logos. It doesn't make the case, its just one tiny piece of all of these weird findings that have been uncovered in PizzaGate.

      Highlight PED then.   Don't use the ping pong rackets and claim they look like a butterfly, which they don't.   Have you seen

      I was looking through all the symbols.  Only the butterfly is symmetrical.  It also doesn't help that the pingpong paddle symbol has been used a shit ton for actual pingpong events.  I have no doubts about the involvement of Comet Pizza in this pedo ring filth.  I just think that not every little thing is a clue.

      So, you put this nonsense up but call me a troll? Let me help you out buddy.
     </p>
     <p>
      First one.  I have different opinions than you.  Thats how life works.
     </p>
     <p>
      Second one.  I was very obviously talking about the name PizzaGate.  Not the actual scandal.  If you took the time to pay attention to my post, you'd see that I fully believe Comet Pizza is involved in the global filth ring of child pedophilia.  Trying to make sure people don't obsess on every fucking tiny thing so that they miss the bigger picture is something you and everyone else should constantly keep in check.  Missing the forest for the trees is precisely what they want everyone to do.
     </p>
     <p>
      Either way, thinking I'm a troll pretty much verifies you didn't bother reading and paying attention to what I typed.  Hopefully everyone isn't as dismissive as you or else a whole lot of important stuff will be missed while focusing on false clues.

      Hell no.  I didn't say he wasn't a creepy pedophile.  I didn't say he wasn't involved in a pedo ring either.  In fact, I haven't countered any of the actual claims around this.  I'm only trying to get people to think before linking everything they see into something.  Non-relevant data points cloud what is already hidden.  Adding it unnecessarily doesn't help uncover the conspiracy or the scandal and only serves as a distraction to throw people off the trail.
     </p>
     <p>
      Like I said, this is all disturbing, but it doesn't mean every tiny thing (like ping pong paddles for a places that plays ping pong) is a clue.  Adding unnecessary connection points makes conspiracy theories look like kooks.  We can stick to creepy kid picks with people orgasming themselves over them in the comments and his connections to Epstein.

     This is definitely something... weird shit happens at that place. Just look at these Instagram photos. What the hell is that all about? Its symbolism. That is very clear. Its a way to communicate to people that do that kind of shit.

      Didn't say there wasn't something going on.  I didn't even suggest that it wasn't a place for the pedo ring.  But pingpong paddles are no inherently a pedo symbol and neither is symmetry.

    Hawaii here.  Bishop estate is shady as fuck.  Like, by all means dig into their dirt.  But, they own land on that entire side of the island.  When it was developed in the 70s they maintained ownership of the land through some kind of lease even though homeowners paid them.  Lease hold? Something like that.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bishop estate is not implicated here, yet.  Pretty much every house in Hawaii Kai will say that even if someone unrelated to the estate built the house and lived in it for decades.
   </p>
   <p>
    I saw someone mention in passing when this dropped that the big metal shack property possibly WASN'T owned by Bishop Estate.  That's odd.  That means a lot of not normal paperwork that only a bigshot could get through.  Whatever the case, i think bishop estate isn't a lead yet and if any house in that dead end isn't owned by them, that's the interesting oddity.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bishop Estate is like a 100year old racketeering operation with generations of scandals.  It would be hilarious if they got wrapped up here.  But we probably shouldn't conflate THAT criminal organization with THIS criminal organization until it's necessary.
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit: oh geez forgot about pflueger.  If that's really his property it might be even more complicated.  His family owned shit tons of property going back just as far if not farther than Bishop Estate.  So the lease situation might be different for a guy like him for multiple possible reasons.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hawaii's so fucked up.
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit2: i was a little wrong.  Apparently over the years, BE offered some people the chance to buy the land if they wanted.  So BE vs not BE owned isn't a valuable signal at all.  Sorry.

      That's why I'm interested.  There's a few local leads in cheesybay.  Just saying Bishop Estate isn't necessarily involved because they own all over the place.

    amazing report.  you should rename this to "Welcome to PizzaGate: Full Report"
   </p>
   <p>
    or we should create a "Welcome to PizzaGate: Starter's Guide" for newcomers, not even redditors.  To ease them into it.  Or warn them if they want to retreat now.  just a thought.

    I was banned from The_Donald for asking why the mods were censoring Pizzagate comments and posts (see what I actually said above). I am actually spooked. Is the mod team compromised over at T_D?

      Holy shit I barely recognize half of those names. No wonder they had a "looking for new mods" post the other day. That usually is their flag for a purge/shakeup.

     I don't think it necessarily means that sub is "compromised."
    </p>
    <p>
     A) Could just want to avoid become a central place for "conspiracy theories," which this still is at this point.  Understandable.
    </p>
    <p>
     B) May want to avoid liability.  Imagine being one of these businesses and being completely innocent, yet being accused or implicated in something so heinous.  I'd be talking to my lawyer, TBQH.
    </p>
    <p>
     C) There's been whispers on pol about how the reddit admins are looking for any excuse whatsoever to ban or gut t_d.  Who knows what kind of "doxxing" rules all this stuff might violate.  A general moratorium on all pizzagate stuff could just be a begrudging but very wise move on the mods part.

     I thought at first that this was just like the EnoughTrumlSpam ridiculous attempt to link him to NAMBLA. Although it was much more obvious they were just making shit up. I want to believe 90% just play the game. As a meme this is amazing. As investigative reporting this is still not convincing and kind of cringeworthy. 
Still the pics and some of the emails are weird and creepy. But why would a pedo ring leave any signs to be found by people with an internet connection and a keyboard. This is probably just a bat shot crazy meme. That some people will actually believe. Are there pedophile rings out there? Probably. Are they using a pizza place as cover and sending emails from their real accounts using pizza related code names instead of using fake one time emails? I find it hard to believe.

      I think the reason Comet Ping Pong owner Alefantis was so brazen in posting pedophiliac images was because of hubris.  He thought that because he was tied into the most powerful people in Washington D.C., who were running the ring, that he was invincible.  Makes sense to me that he didn't feel the need to go totally off the grid.

      I agree. As someone who grew up in the area, a lot of this stuff is just funny. Hidden bathroom doors? Literally everyone knows about them. It's a funny quirk. Kids running around unsupervised? There's pretty much adults everywhere. It's a fantastic neighborhood hangout for kids and adults alike and I'm really sorry for the people who work there that get constantly harassed because of this. I'll admit, there's definitely some weird shit going on, but the restaurant itself is definitely not creepy in the slightest.

     I know that anyone posting pics of those babies and shit on their instagram is a fucking sicko.  No doubt about it.

     I msg another Mod about this and have mentioned it in other threads. Maybe its a good idea to have another stickied thread for new evidence. Once that evidence has been verified and proven real THEN its gets posted to this one

    Guys,
    <strong>
     make a wiki of this
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    The issue with Reddit's system is older, useful info gets displaced by newer submissions often with outdated and uneditable info (in the case of images for example) and it's a mess for new users to navigate. Adding a sub-reddit wiki with point-by-point details and references like this would help a great deal as it's consolidated in one place. That way the main page can be used for discussion, new info and such while the wiki maintains and updates things that come to light. Props for putting this OP together.

    I noticed that in 2009, the original co-founder of Comet and Bucks, chef Carole Greenwood, quit. I found a Washington City Paper article from the time that interviews Alefantis as to what was happening next for the restaurants chef wise....then I read the comments.  Many comments were annoyed by Greenwood's uncompromising attitude. But one stood out to me, so I screenshot it.  I didn't grab the link . I went back to trap the link and copy paste the quote, only to find the comments wiped and a new article added, interviewing Alefantis lamenting the terrible allegations. How can I share the screenshot? Here is what "Carole Fan" wrote in Washington City Paper comments on Oct 22, 2009: "Working with artists is always an intense experience, and there is always two sides to every story. I happen to know Carole's side and it would make those dining on the new food choke and feel nauseous. I will only say if they know what really happened, they like me would no longer dine in either establishment."

      Thanks for that. May I trouble you with another question? I would like to delete this profile now that I shared my tidbit. Will what I posted disappear if I do? Or will it stay up with just user deleted? Thanks for helping a neoludditefag

    As far as the handkerchief email goes, I posted a somewhat thorough analysis last night. I think its very important that it be thoroughly reviewed by everyone as a primer going into this case as it was one of the first links that brought attention that something afoul was happening.

    I saw this shared a few times last week but OP didn't mention in this exhaustive write-up, has it been disproved?

     I posted about that in a sub last night and it didn't resonate.  To me, the resemblance between the Podesta's and the adbuctors were an exact match.

    I posted this a while ago but it didn't get any traction. Go onto the website. Search through the children. 1800 pages. "Parents shall remain anonymous, only children's pictures, ages, and location shall be visible."
Anyone could post any children to the website.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tweety goes shopping is a pedophiles guide to buying children. Notice the bright lights flashing, as in many of the "heavy breathing" videos?

    Please, tell me what you think.

     I'm not buying most of this stuff, but this in particular caught my attention. There's actually a federal law in the US against websites storing info about children under 13, and most websites that cater to young children have stringent restrictions in place against photos. The fact that photos are
     <em>
      all
     </em>
     the website displays, as well as the fact that non-members can like and share the children's pictures, seems really suspicious to me.
    </p>
    <p>
     The site is also weirdly slow for me even though it doesn't seem to have any video or audio or ads. I even disabled ublock.
    </p>
    <p>
     The site is run by an international clothing company, Benneton. Not quite sure what to make of that.

      It's against the law? This site limits the age of the children to under 12.

       I know, that's why it's so weird. Maybe it doesn't violate the law, but even if so, most sites are exceedingly careful when it comes to an audience of young children.

    I didn't yet see anyone mention it yet, but in regards to podesta's "pizza map", MAP also stands for Minor Attracted Person in pedophile circles... Doesn't make much sense in context but its a suspicious coincidence

    To anyone new to the whole pizzagate thing, 
Yes, your right, this could all be lumped together info, and half of that seemed a little innocent. But think of it this way, if you wanted to investigate someones personal business do you think you could find so many possible things that could be incriminating? And what would the odds be that the business your looking into has been used as a fundraising location for political parties?
   </p>
   <p>
    No, there is no smoking gun. But something is off. And there are to many small things that point to something bigger to ignore.

      Let's just assume that he is just running a pizza joint, all this is just another dumb conspiracy(a quite convincing one at that compared to most- and I have a very strong bullshit filter) and people are nuts. Still, there's no harm in digging through all this. If there is the slightest chance that this is real, it's worth it. For fuck's sake, these are children we're talking about.

      Yeah I've had a few friends laugh at me so far and laugh it off saying it's just a 4Chan meme gone out of control. Hell it could be. Hats off to them too if this is all a hoax because it's elaborate, but I don't buy it. This shit is suspicious as fuck and I think something sinister is going on

       My brother first sent me the wikileaks emails a week ago, and I thought that while the wording was odd it was not enough to convince me that it was in reference to pedophilia.  I thought it could have been code for money laundering or drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I listened to this interview with Erik Prince, former Navy Seal and head of Blackwater Security.  He said that a source in the NYPD told him that they requested a subpoena to Anthony Weiner's laptop to investigate a pedophelia connection.  Some people tried to discredit this interview.  But you have to realize that Erik Prince is arguably the largest private military contractor in the entire world.  His job depends on having trusted relationships in the military, state departments, and the police.  Fabricating a story would put his entire operation at risk.  That is why I believe him 100%

        He's a monster himself, he may not be a pedophile, but he's a mass murdering maniac and doesn't care. Almost like Agent..not the main one, the one taking a bullet in the head from Trinity. "It's just a muslim 8 year old boy, shoot the rpg's, chopper 8!".

     At a level of credulity that renders "L'Enfant" as "kids" and not as a reference to Pierre Charles L'Enfant ("the younger"), yes, you could find this many "incriminating things" by inspecting literally any business.
    </p>
    <p>
     Investigation is the art of discerning truth from fiction - not the art of applying your autistic credulity to literally any suggestion that seems mysterious.

    I just don't know, the e-mails are a conclusive proof that something is off, that is certain. But other than being circumstantial (not saying it doesn't seem off af, just saying it will never hold up in court as it is), this Comet Pizza and Ping Pong, while pretty full of pedophile symbols and a rather pervert owner, are so apparently plain in sight that I keep relating this evidence with other conspiracy theories that ended up debunked (though I have not seem almost any conspiracy theory based in such reliable documents and not in metareligious or alien theories; again, this is assuming that Wikileaks is to be trusted)
   </p>
   <p>
    I just wanted to get some outside knowledge from yall and know if I was conditioned by watching so many shit tier lvl conspiracy videos and this is actually something we have to pursue, or if this is just another one of them all along and I should stop paying attention this heavily.
   </p>
   <p>
    xoxo guys, anyway I think that what you are doing deserves praise.

     Russians were right with their anti-degeneracy laws. They're not the same kind as the Nazi "degenerate art" laws, nothing as degenerate existed back then. And with the GRU (makes the FSB (the agency formerly known as the KGB, but really is still the KGB, not that I mind). Russia seems like a haven of sanity right now, and no, they're not communists, at all. There's 5 parties in the Moscow Duma, Putin's party is in the Centre, yes the Communist Party still exists but it is no longer even the opposition party since about 10 years, a more right wing (thus, who would be even more attractive for nuking if they were in power and if Hillary won). I can't believe you guys were on Defcon2, and when Trump won, things relaxed to Defcon3. Defcon2 is a hairtrigger from the unthinkable...And no, if you actually read the damn law, and not listen to CNN or Fox News, you'll see there is no banning of homosexuality. Just that these kind of things have to remain private. I mean, the majority (90% apparently) who are straight and not pedos,duh, do not show extreme love for each other in the streets. Holding hands is enough, even a couple giving themselves an open mouth kiss in the middle of downtown is not that great for a child who has NO SEXUAL THOUGHTS, like 0-4 year olds let's say, it's hard to say, but there is no kid who likes to be raped. Hell, I'm old enough that I remember being at the podiatrist (children doctor, here they follow you until you're 13), that when I was 4 maybe, my mom was with me reassuring me and telling me it won't be long, but being on all four with a rectal thermometer up my ass, it's probably one of my few 4-5 memories of when I was 4 year old+, maybe I was even 3, goddamn it hurt and I know I was crying for it to stop. So Kingsey can go fuck himself in hell, what we're being taught in school about sex is thankfully moderated by the government and not all of Kingsey's crap makes it into our 1 hour every month during another class (in my time it was during Religious Science, as it was still confessional schools, that ended in 2003, I graduated a bit before that.
    </p>
    <p>
     All that to say, these pedos, some of them, the erudite ones, they all worship this horrible Dr.Kingsey and his research where he male and female babies respond "positively" to being touched in the groin and masturbated. Yeah. This shit was done in the strangest decade of them all, the 50's in America, where almost everything bad happening was conceived then. Markovian process... indeed. The guy was a Zoologist, yet he's known as the father of modern sexuality which in turn gave us Sexuality as an actual degree in Universities.

     The thing that tipped that scale for me was a NYPD source saying they found evidence on Anthony Weiners laptop of it, and that it implicated Hillary Clinton and some of her top level staff.

      Yeah but...this article ends with implying the FBI investigation is the next step and Comey already backed down from that. So if there was this "sickening" obvious evidence that NYPD officers were willing to whistleblow on...where is it? Why hasn't anything happened in weeks?

    Great post. Never thought it would go this far, but Alex Jones and all of the conspiracy theorists were onto this years ago.
   </p>
   <p>
    All of this started with the words "Spirit cooking", something I, and many others here would've overlooked. We got some great people here! This may have really fucked over Assange in the long run because it was one of the last emails we got.

     What does spirit cooking mean?
    </p>
    <p>
     Also all of this is so hard to believe I'm glad OP provided sources but all I wanna know is
     <em>
      why
     </em>
     are all of these high ranking people pedos? It seems disproportionate compared to the general populous but I don't know much about it so I could easily be wrong

      This is speculation, but supposedly they believe it gives them life extension by being around children. There is some science behind this, including doing blood transfusions, which is what we believe the kids are being used for. Yes this sounds insane, and South Park made an episode satirizing this because it was a conspiracy theory for quite a while now, but it's all coming together.
     </p>
     <p>
      The satanic rituals, or "spirit cooking" is a whole thing onto itself. Taking out the pedophilia part that is supposedly involved with it, it's supposed to set your spirit free and liberate you or some shit. The fact that top Democrats are practicing it in their homes IS indisputable, and we know for a fact that John Podesta and his brother take part in these rituals. John Podesta has this weird ritualistic art in his office, and we have a picture of him with cut fingers on both hands, which is specifically something you do in the ritual. Okay, so maybe he cut his fingers cooking, why the fuck are both his hands cut? If he's cooking and his right handed or left handed, he just cuts one hand.

    Interesting side note related to all of this: Podesta's own wiki page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Podesta) was changed to include the following, on November 6 (see footnotes on the page): "Podesta cooks as a hobby, specializing in Italian dishes such as risotto and biscotti.[44][45]"
   </p>
   <p>
    That sure seems coincidental to make this change right after the pizzagate story, giving a cover story to their obsession with italian food and dishes. Archived page prior to the change: https://web.archive.org/web/20161028181522/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Podesta, when Podesta was still listed as a "Roman" Catholic.

    Tony Podesta
    <strong>
     THEORY
    </strong>
    from same articles listed. Not necessarily a new lead, but certainly worthy of discussion:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Is he using art as an alibi/cover for his travels or is he simply an art lover with the means to travel, buy works and support artists he likes? Maybe both?
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    From  same
    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2004/apr/20/usa.world">
     Guardian article (2004)
    </a>
    :
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Most people in their positions would spend their leisure time unwinding. Instead, they make what Miller calls "Herculean" trips to Europe and further afield to buy art. It is perfectly normal for them to leave Washington on Friday evening and return the following Monday morning, having visited more than one European capital in the meantime. […]
    </p>
    <p>
     Taylor-Wood says
'Tony Podesta is someone who has intrigued me for a long time, partly because he is a very passionate and brave collector of art, partly because he's constantly travelling. I wanted to read about him because I admire his spirit - not to mention his resilience to jetlag'.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Unsure if that last quote is a part of the article or not.
   </p>
   <p>
    From same
    <a href="https://archive.fo/HhWH9">
     WPost article 1st page (2004)
    </a>
    :
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     The up-and-comers Tony favors travel the international contemporary art circuit, the gold line from Chelsea to the Venice Biennale.  [...] To keep themselves in pictures, Tony and Heather jet to art fairs and biennials from Sao Paolo to San Sebastian -- often just for the weekend. Theirs is a life led breathlessly, moving from airport to dinner party.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    From same
    <a href="https://archive.fo/tRPmL">
     WPost article 2nd page (2004)
    </a>
    . Certainly reasonable to say/assume she has accompanied on multiple occasions:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Still, Heather recalls the day, just weeks into her relationship with Tony,
     <strong>
      when she traveled to Chelsea with him
     </strong>
     to look at art.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    From same
    <a href="https://archive.fo/vddrO">
     WPost article, 3rd/same page (2004)
    </a>
    doesn't mention
    <strong>
     WHERE
    </strong>
    but that he does travel to support:
   </p>
   <blockquote>

     Co-conspiratorial leanings aside, Tony likes to see his artists' results and will travel to openings to support them. "Sometimes our life feels like an art travelogue," Tony says of the constant back-and-forth.

     "He travels more than any artist I know. And artists travel a lot," Morris says. "Tony would show up and surprise you."

    If we made the (large) assumption that it is indeed used as an alibi/cover, would it be possible to trace his movements based on researching artists’ work he has purchased, artists he supports, and when/where their exhibitions/pieces were on display? I know people have said art can/has been used for money laundering and after reading about that I thought about this possibility.  I have not done much digging past this, but would like to get other peoples thoughts.

     If he's out of the country a lot, it makes the theory he personally kidnapped that girl in Portugal a lot more likely.

    BestaPizza changed logo. I tried to use Wayback Machine to catch it and nothing is archived! This is strange honestly.
They are destroying evidence. There is still a logo in PDF catalog. Until it is cleaned also, we need somehow to document it... Just making screenshots isn't legit since anyone can photoshop it easily. Maybe make a video of your smartphone screen while you browse the site and open pdf???

    https://i.sli.mg/wGsp3j.png  This guy seems to be called Christopher Lynch and is the owner of a cafe named l'enfant in DC  that hosts pansexual events http://www.lenfantcafe.com/ Not sure if that is making things better or worse - maybe they all just like to be really provocative. Edit: it seems that the previously noted Boum Boum Room is in Cafe L'enfant and not in Comet Ping Pong.

    I just wanted to say that...people bashing on Democrats..forget that there is factions in that party too, like in the Republicans. I'm very happy Trump won on many fronts, and that this scandal might destroy the fake Democrats forever. Bernie was the best candidate and beat both of 'em in all polls, until he was ejected when trying to do the official process at the Philadelphia convention, to prove he was stolen 11 states, (Nevada is especially egregious, but no way did he lose ANY New England state or even New York, I know about this stuff from insiders of the DNC who have spoken out on podcasts/radio shows. The real Democrats, the progressive wing, the Wydens and Udalls and Feingold(I think he tried to re-become a Senator in Wisconsin, I don't know how that turned out, in fact, I'm Canadian, I don't understand how you're voting for the President only and then it gives that state's incumbent Senators (and I'm even more confused about congress), but real democrats, who had to be galvanized by the longest seating Independent Senator of all time, because they were not ready for Hillary and the excuse my french, cunts, who would say you're a sexist! if you don't vote Hillary during the primaries etc. were the worst. I've heard things so horrible from Hillary supporters that were done against Bernie supporters...Even Trump said Bernie (in his own strange way of praising somebody other than himself heh) was a good man despite disagreeing (or does he really disagree with some of the "protectionist" and "isolationist" tendencies of Bernie who was spitting on the TPP, TPIP, TISA etc. Trump has to promise not to ratify the TPP, that's the litmut test for him.
   </p>
   <p>
    As for the destruction of the horror that has become more than 50% of the DNC, I'd say real Progressives, real Democrats are maybe 25% of the party nowadays, and the progressive candidates rarely win their primaries (speaking of congressmen especially, for a while I was glad that the Democrats controlled the Senate...that Treasonous letter to Ayatollah Khameni by those 48 Republican Senators after the only good thing Obama has done in his foreign policy (although I believe that when Clinton was Secretary of State, he was not in control at all, Libya is a Clintonjob, same for Syria, Ukraine and the fact she had the military drop to Defcon 2 while she was there, now that Trump won, it relaxed a bit back to Defcon 3, it was at 4 when Obama went in, only because of 911) was the Iran Peace/Nuclear Deal and that idiot inbred from, oh-wouldn't-you-believe-it, Arkansas! Tom Cotton (I hope he lost his seat...oh nah, couldn't happen, he's the junior Senator there, he just got in 2014 so nah. Trump has to wipe the floor of the idiots like Cruz, Rubio, basically most of his opponents, others like Ben Carson, who's a goddamn neurosurgeon yet appeared retarded on stage, should stick to neurosurgery, that's more useful than being President.
   </p>
   <p>
    A bit of scatter brained thoughts I know, but this whole thing has had me feel so nauseous at times, I have to take hardcore nausea meds leftover from when my mom had a minor cancer, I asked her if I could take home her leftover Ondansetron and Triazolam because of this Pizzagate. I desperately needed both nausea killing and anxiety killing. But, remember DoomPaul? Well, Bernie also asks you why didn't you listen? Although, him winning Presidency would..well maybe not, maybe the Pedosta emails were gonna be released anyway.
   </p>
   <p>
    Let's just hope Soros finally dies before Trump is President, Obama is too cautious to provoke anything, and I have to thank him not to have started carpet bombing Syria when the UK parliament voted No on doing that in 2013, that would have been as much of a nuclear war incitement as the illegal overthrow of Yenakovich or whatever it's spelled, he was elected democratically in a supervised election and everything was clean, surprising for eastern europe I know, but then again, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary....they're not too pleased with being in NATO right now, but yeah, the goal was to throw out Russia out of its Naval bases in the Black Sea in Crimea,which is fucking Russian, it was "Ukrainian" only from 54 and on because Krutchev himself an Ukrainian wanted the Ukrainian SSR to calm down, there was still remnants of pro-nazi discontent there...unbelievably enough, but they're the ones who started sniping everyone when Ukraine said alright, we'll go with the EU plan but also keep ties with Russia...the deal was so extremely better from Russia that only dumbass ideologues and USAID (CIA) and "NGO's" would start to snipe at the Maiden protesters of all stripes when Yunakovich was bending over, no, Secretary of State Clinton wanted him out, and I think the FBI got sick of her, when she got sick too (a fucking brain aneurysm surgery) and let Emailgate happen, although Jason Leopold is to thank very much to start all this (remember, the whole reason Russia supports Assad is because Assad rents them their sole warm water Navy base in Latakia (where they have put in a huge jamming system, basically a no-fly zone, that goes into Turkey and could be increased further into Israel, but Putin and Netanyahu had a visit last year where they pretty much agreed to Putin telling him "We'll leave you alone, but don't you interfere with us anymore, or there will be hell to pay". And it practically worked, Israel has been pretty calm since a while too, that's almost suspicious heh.

    Lots of great info but what freaks me out the most is Dennis Hastert. He was actually convicted of molesting children and Tony Podesta actually traveled to teach with him, and maintained close relations after.
   </p>
   <p>
    Like, it's the one bit that
    <strong>
     directly
    </strong>
    relates to the case we're trying to build in relation to Podesta and the Pizza places (since his leaked emails were what started this whole thing). More broadly, the connector is Epstein.

    Okay what I've notice...
   </p>
   <p>
    Take every picture separately. You can somehow justify almost any picture. I get it, there can be a legit excuse for everything; people post odd/misrepresented things once or twice. I get it.
   </p>
   <p>
    BUT
   </p>
   <p>
    Take everything a a whole... PLEASE... please, justify everything as a whole. To me, it can't be and that's what makes the case. Who post this many pictures of random babies , on top of; the odd positions, on top of; the odd weird comment to go along, along with; the conflicts of interests, along with; the high position of power.
   </p>
   <p>
    The high sense of power these people are given make these allegations seems believable. People change with power, even in the average workplace. Imagine that on a grand scale?

    Wanted to say great work OP, me and many others appreciate this whole thread, I've actually printed it out and shown it to others IRL.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mainly writing to say that I may have found somewhat of a solid link between Sasha Lord and another group: the Brooklyn, NY "psych-dance" band Prince Rama. ( https://i.sli.mg/2uPBfD.png )
   </p>
   <p>
    Prince Rama ( https://i.sli.mg/ko9WgZ.jpg NSFW for butt-groping on cover art) performs what it describes as "Now Age" music/visual art, which is elaborated upon further on the site https://now-age.org ( https://i.sli.mg/RpfQ6f.jpg ). Worth noting their connections to the indie rock/psychedelic scene via Animal Collective/Ariel Pink.
   </p>
   <p>
    While looking into this site I found some very odd imagery, accompanying mystic concepts referencing things typical of the new age bohemian/hipster culture, having to do with fantastical ideas of "the infinite", music, the metaphysical, and time/space. ( https://i.sli.mg/pK4qEO.png ; https://i.sli.mg/BsHdZn.jpg ) It also specifically talks about using sound as a weapon to "destroy forms". ( https://i.sli.mg/wkVbnz.jpg )
   </p>
   <p>
    The imagery itself carries some noticeable motifs:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     <p>
      There is a lot of emphasis on the cross and triangles being "forms, once overflowing with mystical significance and occult meaning" that are having their "stripped" symbolism "resurrected". ( https://i.sli.mg/hC9iiI.jpg ; https://i.sli.mg/KlG4dV.jpg ; https://i.sli.mg/bmaoeE.png )
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      The site itself carries other pictures and explanations it claims to use to "illustrate the space between worlds" in many formats. ( https://i.sli.mg/BeWXTN.png ; https://i.sli.mg/3pqVeb.png ; https://i.sli.mg/75zq5s.jpg )
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      The number 9 and enneagrams are recurring, as per their connection to G.I. Gurdijeff/P.D. Ouspensky/J.G. Bennett's "The Fourth Way" system. ( https://i.sli.mg/05cHCh.jpg ; https://i.sli.mg/NqlX8C.jpg ; https://i.sli.mg/ZVFOaK.jpg ; https://i.sli.mg/Jf9QYA.png )
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Lots of pairs of triangles. Notably the first page, which has 2 sets of six in the same arrangement. The Star of David, which has some of its earliest historical use related to the Kabbalah (a Jewish school of thought which originates from early 12th century mysticism and is the basis of Hermetic Qabalah) is also commonly formed using two opposing triangles. ( https://i.sli.mg/y5sNgM.jpg ; https://i.sli.mg/yzFHbX.jpg ; https://i.sli.mg/pkZsPr.jpg )
     </p>
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    If that's not enough, there is specific reference to ritual sacrifice (admittedly a practice of Podesta and his ilk) and Lady Gaga (previously shown to be a regular invitee to Spirit Cooking dinners). ( https://i.sli.mg/wSyRQR.jpg ; https://i.sli.mg/BImR4P.jpg ; https://i.sli.mg/7Euel9.jpg )
   </p>
   <p>
    If anyone can shed some more light on the connections here I would surely appreciate it. Below are some pics that don't quite fit into the rest of this that I saved, and an old write-up of their "art projects" from an older version of their wiki page.

    in waybackmachine you can save put any link and archive specific page that you want. i couldn't save https://bestapizza.ordersnapp.com/home it just opens the hoster page and not real one. wtf.
i though was successful saving the pdf with real logo:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/Misc_images/besta-pizza/Besta_Pizza_8.5x11_Menu.pdf
so it could be later used as proof.. although it is unclear to what parent page it is linked since i can't archive main page of besta.

    Any of you fellow weaponized anons need brain storming ideas?
   </p>
   <p>
    Look into Dyncorp
   </p>
   <p>
    Look into Solvay
   </p>
   <p>
    Follow the Epstein and Dutroux Connection to the top
   </p>
   <p>
    This will all come back to clintons, whitehouse, DC, old dynasties and new ones.
   </p>
   <p>
    Learning a thing of two about occultism will also be highly beneficial

    OK, they may change logo but they are busted by WayBackMachine!
https://web.archive.org/web/20130616101257/http://mybestapizza.com/
I suggest anyone who finds anything important to use waybackmachine to prevent those satanists from hiding trails, because unlike making screenshots, this option is more legit.

    The irony of an alleged Rapist at Wikileaks stirring the pot of pedophilia and somehow keeps forgetting Trump's friendship with Epstein. Epstein pleaded the 5th in regards of Trump or Clinton being with him in the presence of minors. Kek

    I was trying to distract myself from all of this and stumbled upon this video while watching a YouTube mix: https://youtu.be/wusGIl3v044
   </p>
   <p>
    Regular speed clip: https://youtu.be/k6DA_WwO90c
   </p>
   <p>
    Normally this would be a fun and innocent video but with recent revelations it appears there is a sinister hidden meaning.

      Nice work making these connections. Honestly I just stumbled on this video and immediately connected it to pizzagate. Thanks for digging deeper on this.
     </p>
     <p>
      What's been troubling to me with all this is where is the justice going to come from and in what form?
     </p>
     <p>
      IMO We can't completely rely on the FBI: https://www.rt.com/usa/366567-fbi-child-porn-sites/
Although it appears they are using these sites to catch people, and to some extent they are, it is a perfect front to maintain and allow certain members access, without repercussions, to their well maintained and improved sites. FBI Director James Comey couldn't (wouldn't?) indict Hillary despite overwhelming evidence of mishandling of classified information and mishandling classified information seems trivial compared to pizzagate.
     </p>

      Suppose through public and private investigation, in the very near future, a well aggregated case was built on solid evidence, and this evidence is enough to dismantle this ring and bring those implicated and associated with this ring to justice. What media outlet would break the story in its entirety, who would do the arresting and the sentencing, what could be done to make sure people like this can't get into power, and how can we protect the children from these monsters? It is my hope that we get answers to these questions and we like the answers we get.

    Hey OP I've done a little research, on this...
   </p>
   <p>
    This is a Video I found on youtube
    <a href="https://youtu.be/R6ZMYg6nAsw?t=12s">
     Sarah Live! at Comet Ping Pong Tonight
    </a>
    Its awkward, &amp;  what the hell are in those damn Milkshakes? (the video comes off as "grooming")
   </p>
   <p>
    Its from a production company http://www.twentytwentyproductions.com/ http://www.2020productions.com/ 2 separate sites, why do I give a shit?  It has 3 different offices in 3 different country's 1 of the offices is in
    <strong>
     "Dabai"
    </strong>
    .  (wave)
   </p>
   <p>
    Also the 20/20 gets you to this page http://dcwebfest.org/ Bottom of Page, Comet is a sponsor.
   </p>
   <hr/>
   <p>
    I got some Info about Hawaii, but its Tarp money, Banks, and "Elites".  I got info on the art world, but its 
Rineke Dijkstra, and Hilton Head SC related.  I got other leads all pointing back to Dabai.
   </p>
   <p>
    This strangely all ties together, but I don't have the resources, or the man power necessary to take it all on myself.

    Fucking hell...some of this can easily be chalked up to coincidence or misinterpretation, but the whole thing together....this is some seriously fucked up shit. Someone needs to get a group together with some construction gear and storm the place. No way to know for sure otherwise, too many high up connections.
Hell, just the fact that so many political and legal figures connect to a shitty pizza place is weird as fuck, but everything else...

    This is the dumbest shit I've ever seen. Wait, no there's the whole fake moon landing loonies and the jet fuel can't melt steel beam retards.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is a popular pizza joint attempting to be "hip." None of this shit means a damned thing. Trump winning brings out all the loonies that belong in a mental ward, they think they have free reign to spread their lunacy to others.

   <p>
    The business located between Comet and Buck's has a minor partnership with Politics &amp; Prose.  They run the coffeeshop in the basement of the bookstore.
   </p>
   <p>
    Might be worth a look into.  Under new ownership in the past few years.

    That three minute video summary wreaks of confirmation bias and doesn't seem to have a very neutral tone. If this is to be the overview I'd find a better video.

    Dennis Hastert, former speaker of the house and convicted child molester, is connected to Podesta family since they remained friends despite his conviction. Sibel Edmonds nailed him to the wall. Here is her expose, there's a lengthy rambling talk and a short synopsis. https://youtu.be/yP1MtaSIePk. https://youtu.be/Urz-79upuLg
She is very frustrated and posted this one the other day about Podesta. https://youtu.be/7XMoejT3lKs

     You do however have a painting titled "nobody's pushover" in your portfolio of someone wearing a creepy panda mask gesturing towards a young girl who is lifting up her skirt.

     You do also know Alefantis through Transformer DC. But then again so does pretty much every other artist in DC.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll chalk this all up to coincidence if you want.

      Thanks.  Transformer has an annual auction with over 100 artists for the past 13 years.  Don't know if I've met that person? Yup, lots of people work with transformer!  My painting was from an old photo that I think was famous from a well known photographer?  I had my left hand amputated as a child and was showing the girl as not to be "pushed over" and that she is strong, she's missing a foot. Anyways I had lots of people try to put me down for my disability growing up and I was trying to represent "strength" and confidence against the bully. Against the rich kid in the panda mask.

    This info has been put together nicely for any investigative reporter in the world to find.  Yet, nothing will happen because it goes to the heart of the elites in DC and probably as high as the White House.  This information... emails etc., is also in the hands of the NYPD also? Is that correct? Also, what I saw here, for the record is so vile I'm fucking sick.  I keep seeing quotes like "who thinks this shit up?" I concur 100%!

    can someone here explain to me why a secret pedo ring would drop secret little hints everywhere? it just seems a little silly. If I had a secret pedo ring there would be no obvious evidence.

    Please include the connection Clement Freud with Richard Branson. https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-M4RarZdIftk/V2D7gtb-7BI/AAAAAAAAVSE/mrQ8dNXI8SU4N8_MIEIoZFgtnnMsjMXsgCLcB/s320/1%2BFreud%2B....jpg
Since Branson's Island is extremely close to Epsteins. Also Matthew Freud is in the little black book of Epstein so there definately is a connection.

    3rd oldest Review on YELP of Comet Ping Pong. More possible innuendo?

    We heard about ping pong tables and just had to check it out.   Front of the restaurant is full of booth style tables with "ping pong" Type tables, pretty cool keeping with the theme.  In the rear there are three ping pong tables with ample space for playing, and a "gum ball" machine with balls for .50 cent.  The paddles lying around are below average so bring your own.
   </p>
   <p>
    At first the place was great, ping pong in the rear, good beer on tap, and food in the front. Then the rear started to turn into a playground. at one point I counted in excess of 15 kids under 10 wanting to "play. Parents who couldn't understand why they couldn't "play". No wonder the paddles are all ruined.  Seemed parents enjoyed hanging out the bar to drink while they sent their kids to the rear for unsupervised playtime.
   </p>
   <p>
    The menu is simple, pizza, salad, beer wine, but not being able to think with the melodious sound of a dozen little ones running around, we opted to eat elsewhere.
   </p>
   <p>
    Think Chuck E Cheese with a ping pong theme.

    These Pedos all seem to have one thing in common...
   </p>
   <p>
    Aleister Crowley and some form of secret society
   </p>
   <p>
    Here is Hillary and podesta's open connection
   </p>
   <p>
    http://www.veteranstoday.com/2016/11/06/hillary-is-campaigning-with-aleister-crowley-devotee-jay-z/
   </p>
   <p>
    but it looks to go much deeper with these secret groups that seem to be involved with pedophilia Magic and forms of ritual and witchcraft..   strange stuff indeed

    This snipet speaks of hiding in plain sight
   </p>
   <p>
    Page 6 of 123 Eliphas Levi Dogma et Rituel de la Haute Magie
   </p>
   <p>
    Extraordinary fact! Among the sacred records of the Christians there are two
texts which the infallible Church makes no claim to understand and has never
attempted to expound: these are the Prophecy of Ezekiel and the Apocalypse, two
Kabalistic Keys reserved assuredly in heaven for the commentaries of Magian
Kings, books sealed as with seven seals for faithful believers, yet perfectly plain to
an initiated infidel of the occult sciences. There is also another work, but,
although it is popular in a sense and may be found everywhere, this is of all most
occult and unknown, because it is the key of the rest. It is in public evidence without
being known to the public; no one suspects its existence and no one dreams of
seeking it where it actually is.
   </p>
   <p>
    This one speaks of sacrifice of un baptized children
   </p>
   <p>
    Page 8 of 123   Eliphas Levi Dogma et Rituel de la Haute Magie
   </p>
   <p>
    A goat-headed prince bounds forward among them; he ascends the
throne, turns, and assuming a stooping posture, presents to the assembly a human
face, which everyone comes forward to salute and to kiss, their black taper in
their hands. With a hoarse laugh he recovers an upright position, and then distributes
gold, secret instructions, occult medicines and poisons to his faithful
bondsmen. Meanwhile, fires are lighted of fern and alder, piled up with human
bones and the fat of executed criminals. Druidesses, crowned with wild parsley
and vervain, immolate unbaptized children with golden knives and prepare horrible
love-feasts. Tables are spread, masked men seat themselves by half-nude
females, and a Bacchanalian orgy begins;

    Looks like a nasty rabbit hole
   </p>
   <p>
    Hillary was known to study Crowley &amp;  Thelema &amp; O-T-O if you google around a little...
   </p>
   <p>
    If you read thru the first 10 pages of Part I: The Ritual of Transcendental Magic and then visit
each of the friends listed on the comet website you may see the connections I do in the obscure 
instagram, fbook, wordpress blogs etc etc.. photos and poems.. Follow the weird photos to other profiles containing similar photos and so on, many levels into the profiles They are really symbols and allegories 
that correspond in a secret form of innuendo yet in plain sight. the first 10 pages make many references
to this form of communication to the initiated ones, yet unseen by simple minds...
   </p>
   <p>
    Here is an example:
   </p>
   <p>
    (U) Symbols and Logos Used by Pedophiles to Identify Sexual ... (U) The BoyLover logo (BLogo) is a small blue spiral-shaped triangle
   </p>
   <p>
    https://wikileaks.org/wiki/FBI_pedophile_symbols
   </p>
   <p>
    Another example is A heart within a heart, or “GLogo” “GirlLover” is used by pedophiles attracted to girls
   </p>
   <p>
    https://www.newgon.net/wiki/images/GLogo.png
   </p>
   <p>
    You may see may many photo's of coffee in the friends links, if you drill into the instagram profiles etc, like I did. 
look deeper... Note the pic in foam on the coffee..  Right? it's in plain sight. could they be that obvious?

    at first it will seem coincidental but the more you dig you will begin to see a pattern of items described in 
the The Ritual of Transcendental Magic. The devil really seems to be in the details.. literally

    That picture of James Alefantis on GQ top 50 most influential in Washington DC, shows a hard to see symbol on his (own upper left part) of a black shirt. Can we get a blow up of this one?
