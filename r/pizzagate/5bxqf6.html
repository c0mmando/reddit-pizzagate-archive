    Hope he's not meaning that they're going to demolish the children and grandchildren. It seems as though he's talking about drugs, but there's really not enough information. What size/shape box was he expecting? Maybe it really was an assortment of cheeses. After all, what better way celebrate what they enjoy? And we already know how much they love their inside jokes...

    Definitely talking in code; and I think he did actually get an assortment of cheeses.
   </p>
   <p>
    So he was upset about the format change. it caught him off guard because he was expecting this delivery to look and be a certain way, but instead it was square and possibly even full of cheese. With something hidden in the package maybe? You can't just ship pedo shit; you have to disguise it even if you're rich and powerful. So it would make sense that the new disguise threw him off.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have no idea what he means by "playing dominoes on cheese rather than pasta." That question doesn't make any sense; and it wasn't answered by podesta in the reply. I don't know what he means by playing dominoes; that's not a game rich people play. Maybe some kind of weird sex act, but I have no evidence to draw that conclusion from.
   </p>
   <p>
    And hopefully he's not talking about demolishing his grandchildren; but that line definitely comes across as something with a double meaning.

    </p>
    <p>
     No, they can't possibly be this stupid, this must be some kind of big in-joke like /r/nosleep that I'm just not getting.... wait... no... these redditors are serious... wow they're retarded
    </p>
    <p>
