        <p><p>Yeah I noticed some good posts are missing and there is a influx of tinfoil stuff that is just reckless. I mean, if you are not digging or helping who does it, there is no need for new posts. But I've seen that there are a lot of ridiculous and unrelated posts diverting attention.</p>

        <p><p>Probably Spez's, the Reddit admin's, fault. Some crazy stuff going on.</p></p>

        <p><p>Maybe the admins and mods are counter-intelligence and orchestrated the fall of the sub, just saying maybe the sub was infiltrated.</p></p>

        <p><p>Compromised? You don't say...</p>
<p>You were compromised when people called the restaurant. </p>
<p>This is getting out of hand now.  There are people lobbing serious allegations at people here.  If you all aren't careful you might find yourselves in serious fucking trouble here. </p>
<p>I admit, this shit is extremely weird.  There is a lot of smoke.  </p>
<p>IN DC</p>
<p>You guys started with Comet.  Now pizza places all over the nation are being mentioned. </p>
<p>If you guys are right about this, good on ya.  Just bear in mind there are consequences for saying things about people. Reputation and career destroying things no less. </p>
<p>Idk, I just think you guys are playing with fire calling a bunch of DC heavyweights satanist pedophiles sacrificing children. </p>
<p>Just my two cents though. </p></p>

        <p><p>If shit gets bad, might have to move to the <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">voat</a> alternative. </p>
<p>If you want, you can post to this wikileaks alternative <a href="https://reddit.com/r/wikidecentralized">subreddit</a>. The choice is yours.</p></p>
