        <p><p>We need to find similar people &amp; crowd source funding to hire them or something? Or get him these people to help? they now have strength in numbers &amp; only a matter of time. we are their insurance file. Imagine the shitstorm of 500-1m people raising if one of our based ex FEDs gets a gym accident. </p></p>

        <p><p>Are you trying to imply something with your headline ""Less than a year later he gets replaced after ~ 30 years."? According to <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-announces-executive-appointments-3">this</a>, he retired, which is not uncommon for government employees after 25 years.</p>
<p>There was the same FBI director (and same president) when he was appointed to the position 2 years earlier.</p></p>

        <p><p>if he retired why is he running a business now? he was forced out. obviously theyre not going to say he was forced out. Clearly dug to close. </p></p>

        <p><p>Remember <a href="http://youtu.be/BplUD6kQYuU">Ted Gunderson</a>, former head of Los Angeles, DC, Memphis and Dallas FBI. He pretty much sacrificed himself to get the word out, but not enough people listened. Now more and more people are paying attention and putting the pieces together for themselves.</p></p>

        <p><p>Go read some more indepth stuff on Gunderson. There is legitimate reason to be concerned that he could be a plant to steer people in the wrong direction. This guy could be doing the same.</p>
<p>We need to think critically and skeptically about the motives behind these public figures making these claims.</p></p>

        <p><p>Agreed on the skepticism, but what direction would he be trying to steer people by accusing government officials of being satanists involved in the Illuminati? If he's in on it and spreading disinformation, isn't he just drawing more attention to this issue?  If i recall correctly he died soon after these revelations. If you can point me to some sources i'd be glad to read them as i'd like to investigate all aspects before coming to a conclusion.</p></p>

        <p><p>Well I started as a finance guy. My love of finance drove me to high frequency trading, which drove me to machine learning which drove me to deep learning and A.I. </p>
<p>I'll see you a PM, but everyone should know that A.I. is relatively open. I dropped out with 6 months left in school to be a researcher for another startup and after that sold I went on my own. I studied for about two years, but if you have a background in machine learning, physics, nueroscience, or cryptography you can get up to speed quickly. Also being a generalist  helps, but you need to be able to go deep in a few subjects specifically. </p></p>
