        <p><p>Plain and simple misinfo here, Kim Noble's art does NOT decorate comet. There are SOME similarities drawn between one of Sophie McTear's band posters and Kim Noble's "dissociation" painting. Also the handkerchief theme.</p>
<p>But Twitter would have you believe that this art is on the walls of Comet. Pathetic. I wonder how many people have seen this and discarded the entirety of #pizzagate because of it.</p></p>

        <p><p>Exactly. Just look up all the showcases of TP's houses to see documented creepiness. I posted some links on reddit earlier that someone else found. He had a giant photo of someone else's baby in a giant diaper in his entrance hall. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yup, and the Dahmer-esque floating statue. It's more than just a little creepy.</p></p>

        <p><p>This artist does not have any art up at Comet.  The closest "link" was a poster for a concert that someone said reminded them of art by this artist.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is incorrect, the art posted is by Kim Noble. She is a child abuse survivor and has dissociative identity disorder. People noticed the similarities between one of Kim's paintings and one of the paintings done by Tony Podesta's favorite artists. </p>
