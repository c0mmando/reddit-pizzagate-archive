        <p><p>To add, if FBIAnon truly is real and there is a group of white hats just itching to do justice like never before, it will be on par with the Declaration of Independence in terms of historical significance. </p></p>

        <p><p>The possibility that they leaked it to get us ready for the big reveal occurred to me as well.  I'm not sure, though.  It could just as easily be a rogue agent trying to make an indictment happen (it may not happen without public pressure, because so many bigwigs are tied into this that exposing it would cause a national crisis).</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm of the opinion it's the latter. This new Monica Peterson connection and the apparent interest and knowledge among her family and friends of this subreddit, could lead to a relationship where the family becomes the legitimizing public face of this information that their daughter/loved one was on the front lines of. </p></p>
