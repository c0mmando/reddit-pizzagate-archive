    I can't be the only one who visits here and feels this way. I need to get this off my chest.
   </p>
   <p>
    First and most importantly, I admire everyone working hard on this investigation. I am truly humbled and amazed. Many great minds are working together and going to some dark places to uncover leads and connecting the dots.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sadly my mind can't understand. I see the evidence, I see the connections but my mind is hitting a wall. It's happening and It's real. That's where I get off this train.
   </p>
   <p>
    I see no victory in the future. This isn't a fucking game. Once this gets real people will be bought, murdered or worse.
   </p>
   <p>
    It's one thing to click on links online and make connections. But it's a whole different ballgame when you're standing out in the open and you don't know who to trust.
   </p>
   <p>
    You think I like saying this? As a father and caring human being it kills me to come to this conclusion. To accept this horrible evil and pray it doesn't come to my doorstep. Jesus. I want to help , I want to save everyone. I truly fucking do. It makes me so incredibly sad and I haven't been able to focus on anything but for days and days.
   </p>
   <p>
    God damnit guys and girls. I'm sorry. This is evil on a whole other level.
   </p>
   <p>
    I wish humanity the best of luck. It's going to get a lot worse before it gets better.

    You're being quite pessimistic.  And I think it simply comes down to two things.  If you yield, it explains how people like them have gained so much control.  This is the age of the internet.  It's a new arena for them as well.  The cycle continues if we lose here.

    Perseverance friend.  All you can do is be steadfast, good dad, and protect your children.  While we may have accomplished very little tangible good (if any) up to this point, we are continuing to garner interest, support, and assistance.
   </p>
   <p>
    I am like you, I cannot unsee this shit, and it will forever stain my soul, but I think we can still do good.  If one kid is spared abuse from this we will be successful.

    This is where faith comes into play. I have faith in YHWH and his son Yeshua. Do everything you can to get to know them. Prayer, bible, love of family, animals, people, earth. Anything that you personally feel closer to him through doing but within the commandments. This is a predetermined reaction to a problem that we cant fix. We can only hope to be spared suffering until we are resurrected to account for our actions. Good=paradise earth, Evil=destroyed forever .
Just talk to the creator in your head and he will start making you stronger. Tell him your fears, confess your wrongdoings to him , these Satanists have appropriated Christianity for too long. It Will help you in this situation. Looking away won't stop what's coming

    I can understand the decision to take the blue pill. Our willfull ignorance is our chosen bliss.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is my second go-round into this scandal. I went down this rabbit hole over a decade ago and left it behind because I knew it would go no where. Mainly, because the public wasn't ready to accept it and the structures to disseminate information weren't yet in place. It's a heavy burden when you knowingly live in unfathomable illusion and deceit. Back then social media wasn't a thing. I hope this time it will be the great equalizer-despite the censoring that is already underway.
   </p>
   <p>
    Always remember, those who allow crimes against humanity to continue by looking the other way are complicit.

    That is exactly how they want you to feel, and I have been there myself; I get it.
   </p>
   <p>
    But let me ask you this: knowing how deep the rabbit hole goes, why do you think they still put on the theatre and keep it hidden, rather than just being open about what they're doing and the complete control they have over us?
   </p>
   <p>
    It's because they don't have complete control; power lies where men believe it lies. They still need to act out this parody of democracy and freedom because it only works if we are complicit.
   </p>
   <p>
    Each individual has a role to play. Some will have to put their lives on the lines to change the world, but don't be defeated and think that's the only outcome, the only contribution. Talk to and connect with the people around you. Bring compassion and hope where you can, and stand up against the small injustices. Be a beacon to show other people that this world is inherently good and worth fighting for.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is a spiritual battle, whether you're religious or not. They are trying to destroy the human spirit; all you have to do to fight back is to stay human, do not let them snuff our your hope.

    The first few days were the hardest. I had to rely heavily on my SO to be understanding of where I was at emotionally after what I'd seen. I don't get involved with or even entertain conspiracy theories. This is something much different. I laid it out there and fortunately she was supportive of me. Not judging. Not interested in the details. Just there for me. So we went out with some friends and it helped reset the mind.
   </p>
   <p>
    ADVICE: Find someone you trust. Tell them
    <em>
     a little
    </em>
    about what you've seen. Don't overload them with facts. There is too much to communicate at once and it may worry them about you if you try. Go outside. Exercise. Eat a good meal. Recharge. Think about coming back to the topic if you feel able. The good news is that you have a conscience.

      Proof? Or is declaring "CTR" the new McCarthyism? Regardless, sincere people are feeling this way. It's comforting to see they're not alone.

    Agree with the guy who says this is a CTR concern troll.
These monsters are only a few but powerful.
They can be brought down.
Comet pizza is paranoid they kicked someone out of the pizza shop last night because they were "feeding into a altright conspiracy" keep going folks, they're on their heels.

    I've come close to quitting all of this three times. And I've been following it since day zero (November 4th).
   </p>
   <p>
    But thinking about it I realize that not everything has to have an outcome before you start working on it. I've investigated plenty of other things myself in the past because I felt the public was being misled on a topic and it's always challenging to make a commitment to that and still be willing to be critical of your own work.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some of us are going to get burned out and stop, and that's to be expected from a topic that is this overbearingly depressing. I'll contribute what I can for as long as I can manage.

    An enemy with Political Clout is definitely fearsome because they will do all they can to silence the truth to protect the position they have.
   </p>
   <p>
    It's understandable to be fearful because if this is all true, the bombshell would definitely lead to quite an exchange in power as well as make America a bit of a laughing point to of been lead by such people all this time.
   </p>
   <p>
    That's where it gets even scarier, because you also have to consider, is nothing getting done because serving Justice to these perverts would actually cause more harm to America than good, that they've been smart enough to make themselves "important" enough to the eyes of the world to be protected from their sick perversions.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you think that certain authorities are being quiet on the situation, the scary truth can be that they are being silent because they know how bad it would be for America as a whole if this got out and it's really sad that it is a possibility. That's why even if we try our hardest to fight it now, it might not be til Trump is President that anything can be done about it.
   </p>
   <p>
    But even then this potential uprising against these perverts is going to be a long dangerous road, the safest way to go about it is first with proof and second with a unity of the people to open their eyes to the truth that may be uncovered and actually stand up for the rights of all.

    Once I realized that ping pong is double teaming a child back and forth until they're practically dead, then jizzing on their hankerchief once both sides are complete, then the child is eaten (sacrificed to Moloch) to absorb their "life force", it became a lot more real to me. People don't realize the whole point of human trafficking is to have masses of disposable people/children to do whatever you want with them. People still think "oh it can't be that bad", well it's a lot worse than your mind is even capable of thinking, these people are sick in the head, they've run out of all means to exercise their power and extract dopamine other than torturing children in satanic pedophile rituals.

    How is this CTR? Serious question. None of you people who are accusing CTR can imagine how this might effect someone? Especially a parent. Think of this as a support group thread if necessary. You all realize that the broader audience, should this topic blow up, probably isn't as jaded or desensitized as you are...

     I'm afraid to keep digging after some of the stuff I've already read.  I fear digging too deep will get my family in danger.  It's a selfish feeling but when you have a home and you have a wife and a child, those family are your treasure that you protect in your castle.

     Also, looking so deep into something so dark that starts at the very top of the "free world," that reeks of such unusual evil, the darkest most foul evil that is unfathomable to most decent humans.. It's like staring into Satan's very face.  Dark occult forces that operate at the top levels in utmost secrecy, it's enough to gain faith in the battle between good and evil, Christ and Satan.  It's enough to make you truly understand just how evil things can go.. Demonic.

      I'm not even remotely spiritual but I guess there is a good versus evil moral aspect. Take care of yourself-- physically, mentally, spiritually.

       Seeing how dark it goes, I don't know how anyone could doubt demonic participation in this.  To take part of something so sinister as to maim innocent children in such ways and then dispose of them so easily.  Then again, I can't even be mean to a dog.  I guess what I'm saying is though, it seems too dark to be considered natural.  It seems paranormal.

       So you gotta hope if it gets this damn dark, that there's something opposite of it, too.  That's the only thing keeping me somewhat sober.

       Just truly scary shit.  You also keep safe, mind body &amp; soul.

    Don't give up man. It is dark and horribly evil but darkness and evil are not the only forces in this universe and in spite of what it might look like, it isn't strongest either. The servants of evil, in reality, are cowards and in the end there will be a victory for good. I don't know when or what that victory will look like but if you believe in God believe this, He's watching us all and what we do for His little ones.

    Wow, this is where I start to think this is a huge elaborate joke... So ridiculous.
