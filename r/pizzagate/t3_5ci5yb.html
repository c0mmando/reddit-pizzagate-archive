<p><p>Anyone here looking at these sites should make sure they are protected (Tails/VNP etc). Many of these sites could well be FBI traps. They probably already know much of this stuff coming up, so we need to be careful not to damage anything. Be sure they will be reading these posts though, as will make of the pedo's running these sites/establishments.</p>
<p>The smoking gun for me was Besta Pizza actually changing their logo YESTERDAY though! This is an admission of guilt if ever I saw it. This really should be getting media attention, but unfortunately it's all still circumstantial at the moment, no matter how sick and inappropriate maybe of the social media posts and sexual innuendo that's so widely prevalent here.</p></p>

<p><p>Agree, we should not interfere with their investigation but we can help exposing the ring. Be safe and know your OpSec.</p>
<p>Also the FBI is probably already here giving us clues or hidden advice in the comments. Remember there are 2 party's of power fighting each other on this subject.</p></p>
