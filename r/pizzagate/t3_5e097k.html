        <strong>Interesting link between the 9/11 terrorists and pizzagate... Ties to National Guard</strong>
        <p><p>I noticed a couple articles in the news quite a while back talking about the timeline of events leading up the the destruction of the WTC... Mohamed Atta and the other terrorists went from Boston to Maine for one night and then right back to Boston on 9/10-9/11. </p>
<p>At the time I noticed that "Pizza" was always mentioned... in each article...  I'm sure I made a joke about it at the time... cause who makes a special trip to Maine and gets Pizza instead of lobster? Had to be something else going on. </p>
<p>When later investigating a consulting firm supposedly  <strong>"found a pattern in their orders for pizza."</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/05/us/a-nation-challenged-the-night-before-a-mundane-itinerary-on-the-eve-of-terror.html">New York Times</a> said "Employees at the Wal-Mart and Pizza Hut have been instructed by the F.B.I. not to comment on what the men bought or ordered." </p>
<p>You guys already think I'm batshit insane so it can't hurt to theorize that somewhere in Portland is/was some sex slavery going on... So the terrorists made the overnight trip to Maine to get their fill of the "72 virgins" before heading off the next morning to die. </p>
<p>These articles talk about how the FBI was keeping people all hush hush... the first one is just a nbc article for a little mainstream media flair... the next 2 are Portland Press Herald. Then a couple conspiracy theory sites digging into the timeline. </p>
<p>Would help explain why the FBI didn't want the local police looking too deep into that night's events... they didn't want anyone stumbling onto the sick pedopizzaparty being thrown in Portland as payment for hijacking the planes. </p>
<p>I noticed an old mention of a kid from Brunswick that had seen the terrorists on the morning of 9/11... he was quoted by the local papers but then later changed his story once the FBI interviewed him... said he must be mistaken. I looked him up to see if he's still kicking around... he is now running for senate. </p>
<p>Maybe Maine was chosen for its close proximity to the Bush Compound? Chief Chitwood shipped out of state for being too nosy? </p>
<p>Lots of people are suspicious about Maine's role... but I don't think anyone has ever jumped to this conclusion. I'm a nutcase anyways so I don't think I will be silenced by the powers that be... but if you never hear from me again... I'll misssssss you! </p>

<p>http://www.pressherald.com/2011/08/25/september-11-portland-maine-chronology-fbi-mohamed-atta-abdulaziz-alomari/</p>
<p>"As recently as Saturday, an FBI agent visited the International House of Pancakes on Maine Mall Road in South Portland, next to <strong>Pizza Hut</strong>"</p>
<p>"The FBI called <strong>Pizzeria Uno</strong> in South Portland..."</p>
<p>http://www.pressherald.com/2014/03/31/filmmaker_set_to_visit_maine_puzzled_by_silence_of_those_who_saw_9_11_terrorists_up_close_/</p>
<p>After checking into the hotel, Atta and Alomari were seen or photographed at four businesses in South Portland: <strong>Pizza Hut,</strong> a KeyBank drive-up ATM machine, an ATM machine at an <strong>Uno Pizzeria &amp; Grill,</strong> and at the Jetport gas station.</p>

<p>http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=125x30484</p>
<p>Maine Air National Guard is right across the street from Pizza Hut... and right next to a couple of large self storage places... and the Big Apple where they were caught on tape... </p>

If ya get on google maps there is a pin placed by someone on the National Guard for "US Air Force Advisor" there is a picture attached with almost 200 views, but it looks like just a piece of stone tile or countertop laying on the floor.</p>
<p>I can't get a good look at it on google maps, but the back part of the guard base has ample space and equipment for bodies to be buried if needed... alos abuts a river. </p>

<p>The FBI doesn't get compromised overnight. Would a terrorist who's culture readily abuse young girls want to fuck a virgin before they die? you're damn right.</p></p>

        <p><p>I've got my own theories but, Im keeping it to myself. I fully believe this is the leverage Donald has over them. To protect his life. I'm not going to fuck with shit that is way out of my league. However, I will say this... Damn near every fucking American conspiracy theory ever, seems to be connected. From JFK to MKultra. From Bilderberg to 9/11. From wars in the Middle East to Soro's bloody sheets. </p>
<p>It's all connected. Think creatively. </p></p>

        <p><p>I agree... except for Bigfoot... For some reason Bigfoots and Scientologists are the only 2 groups I can't connect to this... (unless my anti-MKULTRA theory is true)  FBI has been working for a long time on tearing out the corrupt guts of the American government... The stars are aligned and now is the time to strike. They might not reveal the whole truth to us... But I am confident that most folks will pay for the atrocities they have committed. </p></p>

        <p><p>I've connected Scientology. </p>
<p>J. Gordon Melton is an interesting character: </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Gordon_Melton "John Gordon Melton (born September 19, 1942) is an American religious scholar who was the founding director of the Institute for the Study of American Religion and is currently a research specialist in religion and New Religious Movements with the Department of Religious Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He is a Distinguished Senior Fellow at Baylor University's Institute for Studies of Religion.[1] He is an ordained minister in the United Methodist Church, and he is affiliated with the New Cult Awareness Network,[2] an organization operated by the Church of Scientology.</p>
<p>He is the author of more than twenty-five books, including several encyclopedias, handbooks, and almanacs on American religion and new religious movements. He lives in Santa Barbara, California.</p>
<p>His areas of research include major religious traditions, new religions and alternative religions, occultism and parapsychology, New Age, and vampirology."</p>
<p>Here's what Melton thinks about ex-members of Family International: https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/J._Gordon_Melton "Ex-members, even those with righteous complaints, tend to reconstruct their experiences — ambiguous situations at worst — into totally negative encounters. They tend to demonize the leaders and turn the members into zombielike followers. Harmless comments are recast into sinister threats, group jargon into conspirational fantasies."</p>
<p>The Family Care Foundation is a branch of The Family International, which used to be called the Children of God church. The same cult Julian Assange was involved with as a child.</p></p>

        <p><p>Interesting... Thank you for your input. I'll have to look into him a little further... I cooked up this little conspiracy theory the other day... Haven't tried to dig into it much deeper since... But Melton could help support my idea that Scientology might be an anti-shadowgovernment group masquerading as a religion in order to undo the brainwashing of MKULTRA and Monarch. </p>

        <p><p>I'm glad you appreciated the info, and I read your thread, but no. Scientology will always be evil. Among other things, they blackmail members with their audits and run slave labor through Sea Org. They need to go down, too, but we're all sort of busy right now with Pizzagate.</p></p>

        <p><p>Being a satanist or a pedophile isn't illegal... being a murderer or a pederast is. I'd assume there will be enough charges for the guilty to keep the really nitty-gritty details out of the public eye. </p></p>

        <p><p>Stop. This about investigating people not pizza places. This is about the Podestas and Alefantis specifically. If we lose focus on that and start talking about 9-11 this will lose all legitimacy and die. </p></p>

        <p><p>I don't know how far it goes but jumping from where we are to 9-11 is not an effective way to focus an investigation. We need to start small. </p></p>

        <p><p>Sure... be a pussy about it... everyone can just keep kicking the dead corpse of Besta and Comet cause you know they are already doomed and thus no threat... or we can get our heads out of our asses and look into something else... even if the big picture truth is disgusting and scary. </p>
<p>But you have fun just drawing bullseyes on a picture of Podesta in MSPAINT for the rest of your life.  </p></p>

        <p><p>It's all connected, pizzagate is simply the dam that's gonna bust everything open. </p>
<p>Q: How did they get these terrorists to commit the crimes? 
A: 72 sex slave virgins from a pizza front. </p>
<p>It's not like it harms anything to look into this stuff. I'd venture to say the posts crying about things not being related to pizzagate are a lot more detrimental to the cause.</p></p>

        <p><p>That's the point though, 9-11 isn't connected to this at all. All this is doing is clouding the issue. If the goal here is getting the people we suspect are involved sent to jail we are miles away, and that should be the focus.</p></p>

        <p><p>You have no post history relating to pizzagate, so I can only assume you are out of the loop and misinformed... otherwise you might just be one the bad guys. I don't see you trying to connect any dots... just erase the lines we start to draw. </p></p>

        <p><p>Maybe it is connected, the same way WikiLeaks might be connected, etc.</p>
<p>You have no proof it <em>ISN'T</em> connected. So stop telling who not to investigate what.</p>
<p>The mere repeated mention of the term pizza suggests at LEAST meme magic.</p></p>

        <p><p>I disagree. I think it's important to understand the big picture and look into the history of these people.  It's not like these pedo rings just popped up overnight. No need to curate the discussion.  It's like telling someone not to look under that rock...useless advice when looking for something.  Look everywhere!</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree with that statement 100 percent. But, I don't think the fact that there is a Pizza Hut next to the Maine Air National Guard is evidence of anything. </p></p>

        <p><p>How about the fact that the FBI soon showed up in town and made everyone at the pizza places vow to silence about what happened... even though some came out and said the terrorists came to their place and ordered pizza in some sort of code. The only reason this got out was cause I think they went to the wrong pizza place initially and confused the hell out of everyone... then they had to hit the ATM again and order in code at the right place. </p></p>

        <p><p>It's in the links I have provided in my original post... The only speculation on my part is <em>why</em> they went to the ATM twice and 2 different pizza places. </p></p>

        <p><p>Someone else might though.  It doesn't hurt. Entertain an idea without accepting an idea. Do that and we will get to the bottom of pizzagate </p></p>
