<strong>Best practices for reaching out to potential victim / reporting to authorities?</strong>
<p><p>I cross referenced the twitter dump with a user in my area and found 100+ creepy non-CP photos of a young girl he appears to be obsessed with. She is currently an adult but was 9-12 in the photos still live on his FB and G+. Butterfly pedo symbols included, inappropriate declarations of love, bikini shots. My stomach hurts.</p>
<p>What are the best practices for reaching out to potential victim?</p></p>

<p><p>Private message her with the info/proof. If some asshole was stalking me, I would want to know. Especially if she has children of her own. </p></p>
