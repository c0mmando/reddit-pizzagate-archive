<p><p>Russia might have had historical animosities with Poland before 20th century, but the shit that happened in 20th century with communists was a shared burden. No one ever speaks about the millions of Russians killed. Most smart Russians, whilst being proud of the accomplishments of the soviet people do understand that the Communists were a bunch of murdering scum who ruined so many countries its crazy to even think about it. Not to mention sour relations, poison peoples minds about this sort of stuff and create a context for enternal war machine. </p>
<p>personally - 0 animosity towards Polish people. Wish we could just stand together as Christian brothers against the oncoming onslaught of degeneracy of our societies, family values and collapse of our countries. </p></p>

<p><p>How can we or anybody else trust Russia after what you've done to Ukraine? The way you mistreated dead bodies, families and mishandled investigation to the 2010 Smolensk crash was just provocative and there were many more actions, threats or just insults directed against Poland in recent years. Your gov media are even repeating the old soviet propaganda about uprising in Hungary, 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia or 1939 invasion of Poland. 
Russia has animosities with each and every neighbour, maybe except for central Asia which is ruled by post soviet dictators anyway. You can blame only your gov for that.</p></p>

<p><p>because you dont see whats happening in Ukraine. Had we not intervened the lives of millions would be worse off.</p>
<p>You need to stop thinking about Ukraine as some sort of democratic revolution. They replaced a corrupt democratically (more or less) elected gov which represented the views of the majority of the population (i.e. pro/neutral russia) and replaced it with a Soros /globalist supported regime which is bloody, violent and also corrupt.</p>
<p>That regimes main hatred of Russia stems from things commited in 20th century - again by globalist communists. Our countries have been puppets for 100+ years. </p>
<p>again i implore you - what benefit does Russia have from war? much better to have friends. When Trump is president and becomes friends with Russia there will no logner be any warmongering animosity. There will be no more need for hatred between us. </p></p>

<p><p>I know your gov propaganda and its excuses. That's the same bullshit as every other propaganda.</p>
<p>I'm not thinking about it as any "democratic revolution" and there was another in 2005 so called "orange revolution" but then Russia did not invaded. The gov of Azarov was dismissed and Yatsenyuk was appointed by Yanykovych, then approved by the parliament majority. It's the same establishment, with Poroshenko on top and he was a minister in gov or Azarov.</p>
<p>What "hatred"? Ukraine did not invaded Russia and whatever happened there was internal issue of Ukraine, Moscow has no right for military intervention and especially for takeover of others territory. </p>
<p>The benefits are clear, strategic military bases of Black sea fleet and destabilisation of Ukraine. Nobody wants to join alliance with an unstable country that has unresolved territorial disputes. Don't be naive, Putin will not be able to cheat Americans and Trump more than once. Politics is not about any "friendship" or emotions.</p></p>

<p><p>the whole russia is scary thing is something that developed because globalist communists were ruling Russia on one side and Globalist capitalists were ruling west on other. Perfect pretext for war mongering. do you honestly think that the average Russian today wakes up and hopes for a government that would invade Poland? Why? Whats the point? We need to be friends. We have more in common than differences. Sure pre 20th century was competative but all of Europe was in war back then. What happened with communism was a tragedy for all. </p></p>

<p><blockquote>

<p>In XIXc Moscow together with Germans split and occupied Poland, just like in 1939. </p>
<p>Why we need to be friends? I see no reason we have to be enemies but nobody is so naive to trust in your "friendship". Personally I think that if your gov could sell the story about "nazi" Ukraine and turn it into an enemy from a "friend" over night then you will excuse everything. Including invasion of Poland which would be just unnecessary and unprofitable, not to mention the consequences because of NATO and EU membership.</p></p>

<p><p>every country invaded each other pre 20th century. France vs England, all of central europe at war. It was just standard rivalry as countries developed and "settled down".</p>
<p>the thing in Ukraine is real and is being suported by Soros &amp; Clintons. Its what they do to divide us. </p>
<p>again, whats the point in invading poland? we have all the resources we need or want. </p>
<p>why be friends? because Polish people will stand against the invasion of europe by the Middle East. So will Russia (i hope)</p></p>

<p><p>Yes, but the difference is that neither of these countries denies or lies about it now, except Russia. I don't think that a genocide of Polish people in USSR (1937 NKVD mass operation) was a <em>standard rivalry</em>, the same goes for sending about 1.2 million people to the camps after 1939 invasion. </p>
<p>... no Soros or another crook invaded Ukraine, annexed its territory and organised an armed rebel. I've said there's no point in invading Poland but if there would be then your gov propaganda will make some excuse for hating it, just like it was with Ukrainians.</p>
<p>What invasion? There're [thousands of immigrants] (http://kresy24.pl/na-polske-ruszyla-przez-bialorus-lawina-uchodzcow-z-azji-i-kaukazu-horror-w-terespolu-to-czeczenski-dzien-swistaka/) from Chechnya, Tajikistan and such trying to cross to Poland from Belarus. We already took about 90.000 Chechen refugees in 90s and now we're taking about a million Ukrainian season workers and immigrants because we need workers, not beggars.</p></p>

<p><p>No, I don't think that, I know few Russians and they are great people. But it is government. Not long time ago, works of Dugin were popular here. You can clearly see from his books what's Russia strategy. Events in Finland, Ukraine and Montenegro just proves that. Most of my friends(Poles and Russians) would like to see our nations working together. Communism is just the last chapter and you can't blame it for all evil. It is hard to forgot about 50 yrs of occupation, death, pillage and robbery and I'm not talking pre 20th century events. What's funny Russia could greatly benefits from trade with Poland but chooses not too. Instead chooses to push shady gas deals, bullying and constantly threatening Poland. For last six years they don't want to give back Polish plane, not mentioning stupid trade wars that they are constantly loosing(apples,pigs,tuck wars). Until this change, there is no way to settle down. </p></p>

<p><p>What are You talking about? Every information is a huge bullshit. There is no "chemistry" law like that nor a plan to leave EU or NATO. The new government said we're not leaving EU. Ok, people don't like EU because of refugees and Merkel, but saying, we want to leave EU is a bullshit. I would vote leave, but Poland was communist country back in time, hence in pools most of people want to be in EU.</p>
<p>PS pikio.pl is not that popular. More popular site is wykop. Pizza gate was upvoted by over +2000 people (http://www.wykop.pl/link/3456803/afera-pizzagate-czyli-jak-4chan-odkrywa-trop-dziwnej-siatki-wsrod-elit-usa/), its much i think.</p></p>

<p><p>The irony in that is really sad. Yet those pathetic excuses for humans would say "Well they did consent you're just making it ugly by telling them it's wrong to be sexually oral with a kid. . ." Like that damn 60 mins in Australia interview.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm from Poland. Pikio isn't actually that big. I mean like wp.pl, interia.pl or onet.pl (top 3 info-sites in Poland). 
But the post is trending on <a href="http://www.wykop.pl/link/3459159/wazne-media-milcza-o-pizzagate-pedofilskie-orgie-i-handel-dziecmi/">wykop.pl</a>, which is quite large, but most of its users are kids or retarded people. </p></p>

<p><p>I don't think so. Almost whole wykop.pl supported Trump in US elections. (conservatives = Trump, right?)</p>

<p><p>Wykop is true bluepilled site. I've been reading through comments and they are just making awkward jokes about people discovering pedos. Those kids will never wake up. Also there are plenty of "zielonek" aka brand new accounts with green name, created for shilling and undervalue whole pizzagate. Either they are stupid or paid by someone (soros maybe).</p>

<p><p>Weird how you can believe #pizzagate but not r/theredpill. The latter seems significantly more reliable if you have even a basic understanding of group dynamics. But, we're not here for that. Move along.</p></p>

<p><p>Those that often post a lot are <em>quite</em> obviously the most angsty. I wouldn't avoid believing someone that said they're all angry misogynistic little pricks, but to write off a better understanding of the dynamics of social interaction because of a blurred public opinion about the loudest most extreme individuals that make up the whole is just so irresponsible.</p>
<p>But let's get back to work, we're all getting derailed here because I was confused about something. Maybe it's my fault, but I'm trying to fix it now.</p></p>

<p><p>Your position is that TRP is stupid. My reply was that was it seems more reliable if you understand the basics of social interaction.</p>
<p>Stupid doesn't indicate that it's hard to come to terms with? Does it not mean that you think it has fault in logic somewhere? My argument is that it is more reliable than the ridiculous claims that we've seen on r/pizzagate (however true they may be, they're still outrageous claims until we can prove them). I didn't change your argument. How are you going to throw a straw man at me after saying I've used one against you?</p>
<p>Damn, you guys are so easily distracted. Get back to work.</p></p>

<p><p>What on earth are you trying to even say. I think that TRP is stupid. That's not something I'm allowed to think or what? /r/pizzagate is so far backing up their claims and showing proof and connections between things. I don't really understand where you're trying to go with this rant of yours.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm not sure why you're held up on these claims. Again, this isn't about TRP. But, to be perfectly honest, learning more about social interactions will help you to more easily weed out people that are trying to mislead you. Understanding persuasion will help you in many facets of life, especially when conducting research like we've all come here to do.</p>
<p>It really sucks that people can't see through basic ass charades like the movement against TRP shit. I understand there are extremists, and I couldn't argue against that if I tried, but there are, without doubt, a significantly higher number of extremists in these types of circles. Reddit just refuses to look in to things they think will make girls not like them, and that sucks to see first hand.</p>
<p>I know I don't need to defend myself, and often taking a defensive stance makes you look worse. But, if you actually try to understand the information and can ignore the people, you'll start to realize a whole hell of a lot easier that plenty of people in your daily life have a lot of influence over you and you don't have to allow that. </p>
<p>Like I said before though, carry on.</p></p>

<p><p>Just a tip for speeding things up when dealing with foreign text: I have firefox with google translate-extension (as a contextual menu). You can select foreign text and choose with right mouse Translate with Google. It will set the language to autodetect. It's not for long text but saves you the hassle to copy and paste, and have to select language. It will be showed in original layout.</p></p>

<p><p>I'll probably get downvoted for this, but could we try to not use the term 'red pill' too much? I realize you're using it in a way that isn't referencing TRP, but many people will relate it to that awful site. There are all kinds of people coming to this sub, and it's best if people aren't being alienated and given fodder for 'pizzagate is a right-wing conspiracy'. I know that probably sounds like I'm being overly sensitive about a couple words, and maybe I am, but I know that if I was coming here for the first time with no knowledge of pizzagate, seeing stuff like 'red pill' or similar, I'd definitely have doubts, and while I would still look further into it, many people wouldn't because they'd get a bad first impression. </p></p>

<p><p>No no, you're absolutely right.  of all the things in this sub, "red pill" is definitively the one triggering me the most too.  </p></p>
