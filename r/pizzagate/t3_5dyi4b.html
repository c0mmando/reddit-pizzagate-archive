<p><p>Go to other subs like r/Parenting/ and alike with active userbase and just try to hijack the threads. I think it's quite a valid option at this point.</p></p>

<p><p>Was thinking more the survivor groups, not the sponsored ones. One thing we do know is if govt or Corp money touches it it goes to shyt, sorry I didn't express that well. There are all kinds of grassroots survivor groups, and uh, yeah, notify the official ones with an archive link.</p>
<p>ðŸ˜¸ðŸ‘¼âœŒ</p>
<p>Also know that the historic cases in England are connected, some how. <br/>
 ISGP.org 
Has a lot of research, but kids I was growing up with in the 70's and eighties, military brats...runaways...you notice when people don't show up anymoar.
And when you get locked up you quit talking. 
But you never forget.
Amirite?</p></p>

<p><p>hmmm i think still best to focus on potential future victims (ie young parent groups or w/e if they are out there). survivor groups could confirm i guess but theyve been saying this stuff for decades. </p></p>

<p><p>Yeah, well some asshole in Europe took pics of me when I was a kid. So it has been going on for decades. After I gave my police statement my dad (army) suddenly had to move out real quick, cause, you know...any who. Yeah this is not a new thing. This is how government's are run. Not just in England.
Look at the Franklin scandal .
Look at Dennis Hastert.</p>
<p>Yeah. It is like THAT.</p></p>

<p><p>im deeply very very sorry for what has happened to you. please dont misinterpret anything about what im saying as a lack of care or sensitivity for your (and others similar) plight/experience. the thought that this happens with complicity of those who are charged to protect us frightens me deeply. </p>
<p>all i meant to say was that yes everyone needs to know about this, but best and fastest way is to talk to people who are completely in the dark about this and who will express massive shock and will speak out about it to their own friends &amp; family.</p>
<p>all the cases you mentioned i am aware of. all of this is extremely dark. again hope you dont misinterpret what i meant. </p></p>

<p><p>Not trying to over reach or go to big. When you are abused when very young, your mind compartmentalizes. You know the pain others have not felt. You may not remember the incident but the body does. 
Initiations into many secret societies and cults runs on submitting to a deep humiliation, to prove you will do what it takes to belong, and keep quiet. 
Imagine you are a politician wanna be, and say some rich bankster offers to sponsor your campaigns, just come on over to this party....well now you are half toast Ed, and a fourteen year old is brought into the room and passed around. You really want that contribution, everyone else is doing it (the child) and voila. What you don't realize is there is a camera recording it....</p>
<p>Imagine whole government's controlled just like that.

I remember the stranger, and posing. And touches from him that shouldn't have been.
But have a ton of gaps in memory that should not be gaps. I don't want to go further and I can't point fingers at any one yet.
Would love to find a hypnotherapist that is not a part of the darkside, but am at the moment still to poor to go there. But the feeling of being high as fuck on shrooms, I knew that feeling from way back, the first time I did them. I don't have my shit all sorted. But from other survivors I have talked to I am not to far off. 
Not trying to fear monger just point out that Epstein didn't have just anybody in his book. He had people that have raised red flags without him.</p></p>
