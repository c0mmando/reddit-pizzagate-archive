   <strong>
    Just hear me out, wondering about Epstein's black book and Trump connection.
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    So apparently Trump, his ex-wife and Ivanka Trump was in the black book? How bad is this?
   </p>
   <p>
    https://archive.org/details/HereIsPedophileBillionaireJeffreyEpsteinsLittleBlackBook1
   </p>
   <p>
    I know Clinton was in it and that H. Clinton and Bill went to sex slave island.
   </p>
   <p>
    BUT - I also know Trump has said he hanged out with the Clintons just to get power when he was in business.
   </p>
   <p>
    So how complicit is he? Did he go to island? Do we have flight records of him going there?
   </p>
   <p>
    If he went there and participated in the underage prostitution, how fucked are we? No justice against these pedophiles during Trump's presidency because that would take him down as well?
   </p>
   <p>
    Honestly, I can't say I would be surprised if he went to orgy island and had sex with younger women. I can't see him having sex with underaged kids. BUT if the pedophiles have evidence of him on that island, maybe they even tricked him into sleeping with what he thought was a mature woman but who was actually underaged, then he's fucked. ( Like a 17 year old and not 18 year old woman or something. ) And even if it's just evidence that he slept with mature prostitutes, still fucked.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then he can under no circumstance charge these pedophiles and nothing will happen because then he knows if he tries to take them down for pedophilia, they will take him down as well. They won't use the pedophilia leverage against him if he tries to take them down for corruption like he has threatened, because if they revealed evidence of pedophilia before he used it against them they would have even MORE evidence AGAINST themselves as they had to be there. So it's mutually assured destruction.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sorry if abit of a ramble, been up all night because I couldn't sleep after finding more information on pizzagate.
   </p>
   <p>
    I will say this, I do believe Trump is "good". When I say "good" it's that he's much more good than evil.
   </p>
   <p>
    Meaning he might've slept with prostitutes but he doesn't kidnap children, mutilate their genitals, torture them, kill them and perform satanic rituals on them. Or do any other big corruption things that the Clinton gang and globalists are doing.
   </p>
   <p>
    That's what I believe about him. In the end I believe he hanged out with these people because he needed power to advance his business. Political favors. Same reason Ivanka was in the little black book because she was taking over the Trump organisation so she had to know the people in power.
   </p>
   <p>
    But I'm open to discussion, none is free from criticism. I think this is most noteworthy, he is an enemy of these people, we already knew he had socialised with these people for political favors, only question is if he's complicit in these sex crimes they commited. So far, the little black book ONLY tells me the thing we already knew, that he socialised with those people. BUT it implicates he might be complicit in some of the sex crimes.
   </p>
   <p>
    BUT AGAIN! If he WAS complicit in BIG SEX CRIMES, the pedophile globalists must've had enough dirt on him to completely PREVENT HIM FROM RUNNING. I mean massive dirt on him like pedophilia that would ruin everything he has. Business, name, reputation, family legacy etc. etc.

    You have to figure that a huge chunk of elites are involved in some sort of sexual shenanigans... and the ones that aren't into kids or harming people... are totally complicit because they are in the minority... or banged freebie hookers. There is nothing any of them could do to stop it. The few people that speak up about this pretty much lose their careers/lives.
   </p>
   <p>
    Maybe Trump did bang a dozen of Epstiens hookers... maybe even some younger ones slipped in... age of conesnt varies based on jurisdiction so even a 16 year old could be legal... but I don't think he is a pedo.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm guessing the FBI has vetted Trump very well and even if he did do something wrong... as long as it wasn't kids... they will forgive it. The government wants to usher in a new era where whistleblowing isn't stigmatized. Trump is a straight shooter and he would have told the FBI if there were any skeletons in the closet that might fall out in the election... and the FBI are pros so they would have known without him telling them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Trump has literally been risking his life everyday since the 9th... that takes some guts... and it won't be forgotten. Trump doesn't drink/drug so I doubt he'd ever get so out of control at a party that he'd do something he'd later regret.
   </p>
   <p>
    HRC had millions at her disposal... if there was any dirt on Trump she would have had it dug up and used...
