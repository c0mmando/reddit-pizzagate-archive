        <strong>"favors", "extras", "officers" - code words according to the anon. FBI from 4chan</strong>
        <p><p>So far, I have been unsuccesfull in finding emails where the words "favors", "extras", "officers" were suspicously used as a code. 
The anonymous but famous FBI hero from 4chan in his latest AMA (http://archive.is/0oVo3#selection-38167.0-38167.30) suggested that we should look out for these code words. 
Anyone found anything remotely interesting up to now? It would greatly increase credibility to his claims to me...</p></p>

<p>Just read this actually and I believe it contains every word there. This is obviously not from the emails, but I was trying to figure out if there was any validity in the supposition that the NYPD or some good FBI agents might be on our side. </p></p>
