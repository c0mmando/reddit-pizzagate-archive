<strong>To truly expose this pedophilia ring, we need a whistleblower</strong>
<p><p>The work being done on this and other subreddits to expose the depth of the phrase "absolute power corrupts absolutely" is invaluable.</p>
<p>I have a sinking feeling it's not going to be enough. I've seen posts focusing on "share share share" and maybe "meme magic" to try to get this mainstream. "Share" works so long as people are all members of a social media tool that isn't publicly traded. Yik Yak would have been a way, but people have to make profiles now. The other reason people won't "share" or write about publicly is 1) fear they'll be ignored because they're the only one saying it and 2) fear of reprisal for talking about it.</p>
<p>Memes are considered by the FBI an example of "confirmation bias" - people share memes they already agree with. Whether this is the reality or not, I'm concerned memes about the pedo ring 1) won't be anything anyone already agrees with and 2) won't be able to provide enough context about the ring to give anyone a full enough picture for them to be valuable in spreading the information to others.</p>
<p>To maximize exposure and credibility, it seems clear we need a whistleblower. Someone who has seen or partaken in the ring, the murders, the coverups. In Australia, the pedo ring Kidman was involved in included prominent actors, writers, comedians, doctors, lawyers, politicians - elites. We need one of these. Ironically, I think if the whistleblower was an actor / actress it would give the scandal the most credibility. Someone who would have nothing to gain from breaking the news, someone so famous retribution would be obvious. When we come across someone like this, we should see if we can take steps to convince them to go public.</p>
<p>Keep your chin up, your eyes on justice. There is nothing more important than saving these and future children.</p></p>

<p><p>I think anyone who would know about it has also partaken in some terrible shit, it's how they can keep it secret. The threat of blackmail that dark is serious.</p></p>

<p><p>Im thinking the amount of evidence needed be taken seriously with msm is probably higher than what the FBI would need to start digging themselves. </p></p>

<p><p>Off the top of my head, Corey Feldman and Roseanne Barr have alluded to the Hollywood ring  before, but nothing gets done.</p></p>
