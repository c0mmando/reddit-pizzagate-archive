        <strong>11/12/2016 *UPDATE*: Please see: Subreddit Rules. Community Objectives. Investigative Resources. Summary of the evidence found and security precautions needed to keep yourselves anonymous and safe, as well as ensuring we properly document all of the evidence discovered.</strong>
        <p><h1>Please read this whole thread before posting</h1>
<p>This thread was last updated 11/12/2016 - <strong>Please be sure to see  #5 regarding information about security precautions needed to keep yourselves anonymous and safe</strong>, and the <strong>Subreddit Rules #6</strong> and our <strong>Community Objectives #7.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is a very strange and generally taboo topic which already is labeled as a fringe conspiracy but there is plenty of real evidence to support it. The issue is that misinformation is being spread often in this subreddit to a) discredit the real information b) draw eyes away from the important findings c) manipulate new viewers so when they research the thread they believe this is all a bunch of loonies running around.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe after investigating the leaked podesta emails from wikileaks that podesta and other connected people may be apart of a pedophelia / human trafficking network. While there has been some connection to ritualistic ceremonies, the main issue first and foremost is, and will be, that children are potentially in danger. Any information that is spread in this subreddit about blatantly racist or fictional ideas and theories are most likely the cause of internet manipulation (Trolls and CTR). We ask that you downvote blatant misinformation and continue to focus your research on grounded theories which have actual evidence. Please be skeptical."</strong></p>
<p>PLEASE let me know if you have any suggestions or additions!</p>
<hr>
<h1>1) ENSURING WE PROPERLY DOCUMENT ALL OF THE EVIDENCE DISCOVERED</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>It is very important that everyone archive all of their research because everything is being removed as soon as it is being discovered. http://archive.is/ is useful but is also a good idea to save anything you find and re-upload it to a 3rd party source like http://sli.mg/</strong></p>
<p><strong>People should also take encrypted archives of as much as they can on a personal device. There is no guarantee those archive companies will be able to store the data forever and who knows the ties they may have! Be smart.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This subreddit does not advise or condone contacting anyone being researched in anyway, it will likely cause people to destroy any existing evidence and bring unnecessary attention to what we are doing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do NOT harass people!</strong></p>
<p><em>Please let me know if you know of any other resources that you think would be useful in documenting this investigation.</em></p>

<h1>4) ADDITIONAL RESOURCES NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO WIKILEAKS:</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Mountain of Evidence for a Massive International Pedophile Ring Protected by Police and Intelligence Agencies:</strong></p>
<p>This is very good and detailed background information into how extensive this all actually is. Anyone truly interested in understanding this subject should read this, it was posted by a redditor on /r/conspiracy 3 years ago:  https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/</p>

<h1>5) PROTECTING YOUR ANONYMITY (VERY IMPORTANT!!!):</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>1) Using some combination of a throwaway account, Tor, and VPN are good simple ways to protect anonymity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>DO NOT use Tor if you aren't extremely well versed in it, if you connect to the wrong node you could be unwittingly transmitting cp to other computers without even knowing it.</strong> 
- Thanks /user/Antaria/</p>
<p><strong>2) TAILS is a good Linux distro that routes all internet traffic through TOR by default. If you want to be super paranoid, burn the bootable image to CD and run it on a machine with no hard drive connected. Short of a cold-boot RAM attack (not gonna happen), there's ZERO data that can possibly be stored on your computer, and the only concern is if the TOR exit node is being sniffed. That can also be circumvented by running in from public WiFi (ideally with your back to a wall in a coffee shop with no security cameras. Pay cash for anything you buy). At that point the absolute worst that somebody could figure out is the general city you're in.</strong>
- Thanks /user/JangoTheJanitor/</p>
<p><strong>3) DO NOT trust ANYONE on here and never share personal contact details. They are watching us right now, you can be sure of it.</strong></p>
<p><em>Please let me know if you know of anything else people can use to protect their anonymity in this investigation.</em></p>
<hr>
<hr>
<h1><strong>6) SUBREDDIT RULES</strong></h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: We are a politically neutral subreddit! This is not about the left vs the right or any other ideology. This is about good vs evil, the people vs the globalist elites, and this evil crosses political affiliations. Do not be politically biased and be open to new information.</strong></p>
<p><strong> Please do not start witch-hunts or doxx people as that will be the fastest way they shutdown this subreddit.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Please report anyone witch-hunting, doxxing, posting blatant misinformation, making threatening/violent posts, posting about engaging in illegal activities/breaking the law, concern trolling, obvious CTR, or derailing from the goals of this subreddit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>IT IS IMMENSELY IMPORTANT THAT WE STICK TO THINGS WE HAVE EVIDENCE TO BACK UP, THERE IS PLENTY OF ACTUAL EVIDENCE LINKED TO CONNECTIONS MADE FROM THE WIKILEAKS EMAILS!</strong> </p>
<p><strong>PLEASE REFRAIN FROM HAVING DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE HEAVILY ROOTED IN CONSPIRACIES AND HAVE NO SOURCES!</strong></p>
<p><strong>STAY ON TOPIC</strong></p>
<hr>
<h1><strong>7) COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES:</strong></h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>This subreddit is specifically for discussing and investigating the international human trafficking ring/child sex trafficking ring/pedo-ring that was uncovered by the leaked Podesta/DNC emails dumped by Wikileaks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our main goals as a community are to document the evidence, raise awareness, seek justice for all of the lives that have been ruined by theses disgusting people, but most importantly to do our best to try and save these children who are being subjected to this and to prevent any future children from being subjected to this great evil of humanity that needs to be removed from our society once and for all.</strong></p>

        <p><p>The description for issue 7 says the theme was commune and they were working on integrating ideas like "sharing, collaboration, and cult creepiness" into their work. </p>
<p>So you might get that vibe since that was apparently what they were specifically trying to express as a theme at the time. </p></p>

        <p><p>"Dr. Pong" is also a friend, and on the website there is a background image with strange smudges. <a href="http://www.drpong.net/img/bgd_informationen.gif">This is the image</a> Could just be decorative, who knows. Just weird. I don't have a lot of forensic experience to help out but I do have a good attention to detail so if there are hidden images anywhere I'll notice lol. Like the triangle in the tab title of the Panda Head website... Definitely an all-seeing eye reference there.</p>
<p>EDIT: If anyone thinks this is at all important I'll archive it. I'm using Tor right now so I haven't archived anything yet.</p></p>

        <p><p>All I've seen so far is a screen shot of what appears to be a 4chan post listing off what each code word supposedly means. I haven't seen anything else to corroborate that any of these words have actually been used to refer to the things they are meant to be referring to prior to these emails being released. </p></p>

        <p><p>I think here is fine actually. A private board may likely alienate users and then there's the issue you brought up of anonymity.</p>
<p>If the sub is wiped it can be recalled like so...</p>
<p>http://archive.is/https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/*</p>
<p>This summary is pretty awesome. At some point I think building out a wiki on this sub would help folks get up to speed. Not totally needed but might be helpful.</p>
<p>*edit - I'll keep archiving shit man, no worries. We should all do it!</p></p>

        <p><p>Maybe move the info to several blog and board sites. Just to preserve it. Not really for anyone to post just the facts from here. </p>
<p>This is to much. This is crazy. I've been hesitant to pist this on my Facebook just to open some eyes up. But I posted the first few original pizza reddits and either they call bs or just look at a few posts and like I've seen enough there sick. </p>
<p>I live you all for doing this. </p></p>

<p>My opinion is that this should be front and center as the first thing people see when clicking on this thread</p></p>

        <p><p>If anyone is interested in using Tor (and I would recommend it if you have no VPN or reliable proxy) the first thing you need to understand is that <strong>Tor does not provide end to end encryption.</strong> What it does is make it impossible to track where your connection is coming from. This is why you should never sign into any personal account using Tor, as these details could be visible at the exit node. Instead make sock accounts for use exclusively in Tor. And if you need to communicate sensitive information privately, avoid Tor all together.</p></p>

        <p><p>Regarding #faggot....</p>
<p>(Note: There is much speculation involved here, but it appears to ring true.)</p>
<p>Both "faggot" and "fascist" derive from the Latin root Fasces. Faggot refers to the bundle of sticks used as a symbol of fascism. When people realized the child abuse inherent in the system, it became a slur for the fascists themselves.</p>
<p>Child rape was no more acceptable in ancient Rome than it is now. This was not a normal relationship in another culture, as it's presented today. When the fascists were caught raping children, they were burned. Stories of these executions have been replaced by stories of burning non-pedophile homosexuals in order to demonize the practice and bury the past.</p>
<p>Similarly, the term "faggot" has since been linguistically morphed into a pejorative for non-pedophile homosexuals, in an effort to obfuscate the satanic command/control structure of child rape and torture that's still in place by the global fascists today.</p>
<p>Fascists are hiding behind homosexuals just as Khazarians hide behind the Jews, using them as human shields to absorb blame and deflect suspicion and as political tools where useful.</p>
<p>One last thought... People in a victim mindset, those who have endured trauma, are easy to manipulate. MKULTRA writ large.</p>
<h1>Conclusion: "Faggot" was originally a slur for Fascists, who used child rape and torture in Roman times as their command and control structure, just as they are today.</h1>

        <p><p>I knew there was a reason I hated the imagery of the Lincoln Memorial, but I wasn't able to articulate it.  I'm shocked I've been missing the fasces all this time.  It's like a fnord.  How'd I miss that?</p></p>

        <p><p>A fnord is something people are trained to be unable to see, because seeing it invokes so much anxiety that they just repress the sight.  The idea is from a novel about conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>There's a real-world phenomenon of people failing to notice things that would stress or confuse them.  However, the effect isn't reliable AFAIK, so I doubt real-world conspiracies depend on it.</p></p>

        <p><p>If you read it with the mindset that you're going to be confused, it's a fabulous read. A lot of the times things don't seem to make sense, there aren't really chapters, just a strange stream of consciouness that jumps through space and time throughout the story, and it's probably a book that one would have to read multiple times to truly appreciate it's depths. I highly recommend the author, Robert Anton Wilson.</p></p>

        <p><p>Hey mod check this out https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/5cirec/support_comet_ping_pong/</p>
<p>This is being investigated it looks like.  Nobody should be harassing anything or anybody.  This is only going to make everyone's job harder. </p>
<p>Also, I've been following this from first time somebody noticed the pizza code.  Any relevant authorities have to know about this by now.  I've seen a couple people on 8chan say they got knocks on the door over this and have stopped digging, folks .  One anon posted a pic of the Department of defense watching their traffic.  </p>
<p>I'm not trying to scare people just prevent anyone from getting suicided or in trouble.  Personally from now on i'm just gonna follow the story.  Just use common sense.  We pulled on the devil's tail with this one.  Just keep it public so people get a legit investigation and it doesn't get buried.  </p></p>

        <p><p>Hello everyone, Im quite new as a member on reddit, and have been following this case intensely over the last days. </p>
<p>I am not a hacker, and dont have much data skill, but I am good with researching leads and data, and have been looking into the big net of the international crime syndicates, and I suspect it is MUCH bigger than any of us dare realize. </p>
<p>I think this whole thing is engrained into the top administration of the world, most notably CIA (and other intelligence operations), military industry, top politicians etc. etc. I believe it is so much bigger than we realize, and that these people are much more dangerous than we understand. You guys have probably just scratched the surface with Pizza Gate. This may sound as sensationalism to some, but if your suspicions about Pizza Gate are correct, then that proves this is being protected by the system. Ted Gunderson, former FBI director (of a branch of the organization), stated that it is quite suspicious that there are no records of missing children in the US. Neither by the FBI nor 
the National Center Missing &amp; Exploited Children. </p>
<p>I dont have any hard core facts, I am just sharing my suspicions. I encourage you so much in bringing this down, and hope you stay safe and operate intelligently and with group think rather than lone wolf style investigation. Cooperation is key here, I think. </p>
<p>I'd like to direct you to some incidents you probably already have seen, but nonetheless (if you find them relevant I bet you'll find good intel faster than me): </p>
<p>The Hampstead Satanic Ring (Maybe connected to the BBC Savile story): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFkBfGaqLv4</p>
<p>The Fiona Barnett story: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87lRjfLg2Sk</p>
<p>Ted Gunderson, Brice Taylor &amp; Cathy O'Brien on CIA MK ULTRA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cb3KTQyP3zE</p>
<p>I believe looking into things like this may be useful as background knowledge for more effective researching. </p>
<p>There is a lot more out there. Stay safe. Best wishes. </p>
<p>(I almost signed with my name there, haha, since I normally do that by default.) </p>
<p>Peace out. </p></p>

        <p><p>Hi, Fiona Barnet has a radio show on my station www.awake radio .us. Thursday afternoons. 
But you may want to check out my interview with Abe and Ella from the Hampstead case and the report we did the following week. Very strange. Talk about a rabbit hole!
Also check out my interview with Cathy O'Brien and her husband.</p>
<p>Now for a real tid bit for you guys that just may blow your minds a bit. Oct 9th just a few hours before the debate the Trump campaign contacted me for Cathy O'Briens contact info. The guy that called me ( a friend) had just gotten off the phone with Roger Stone. 
Here's a link to the Youtube archives of my radio show. It's the SRA playlist but there's many interviews related to these subjects that are not correctly organized by playlist.

        <p><p>You should also add Missing 411 stuff to this. David Paulides has also had issues with the National Park system in America. They also do not have a list of missing people.</p></p>

        <p><p>Just three general observations in endeavors like this.</p>
<p>(1) Investigations, especially those by authorized police agencies, PI's and such, that is pros should work both ways.   For the top down, eg "pizzagate" and all related threads running from that.  And ground up.   That is:  finding and documenting the individuals and children, or rather children become adults involving.  The pop-up massage parlour trade is one source, UN camps and refugee programs another.</p>
<p>(2) Learn from cultures, such as China and Japan where  child-sexuality is more openly discussed. </p>
<p>(3) I have observed the habits of mice in the house.  Even though the mice are different, years apart, generations and generations apart, they still follow the same exact trails and habits.   This is also so with sex-trafficking. </p></p>

        <p><p>This pic never seems to make it into the list of creepy jimmycomet pics, but it seems like one of the most damning.
http://archive.li/UwEvY
jimmycomet posts the pic, then comments: "Why does Daddy like BUTT? #buttmag #illtellyouwhenyerolder"
Then the apparent father mr_scott_cummings likes the post!</p>
<p>(The screen capture seems to be from yooying.com, which seems to be an instagram viewer. I forgot where I got this link from.)</p></p>

        <p><p>Okay, so the post is actually still viewable. I went on Comet's Facebook page and was just reading reviews in which they responded to one? Not sure if this could be relevant or helpful at all, but I haven't seen anyone else post it so I thought I'd share. </p>

        <p><p>I mean, if someone who's a bit better versed with more collective data wants to repost the image in a new thread, I would be perfectly okay with it. I don't want to make a fool of myself with lack of evidence other than this screenshot haha</p></p>

        <p><p>You have to put the wiki leaks quote in the TOP OF THE SIDEBAR. ABOVE ALL ANNOUNCEMENTS AND GUIDELINES. IT SHOULD THE FIRST THING PEOPLE SAY. "It is curious. We don't know what to make of it." - Wikileaks on the Pizzagate investigation. It is vitally important. Make this happen now pizza. </p></p>

        <p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm a skeptic of all this.  This evidence that is being presented seems pretty weak.  So I would like to play devil's advocate.  Convince there is something here.  It seems to fail in the court of common sense.</p>
<p>I saw the gif that summarizes pizzagate and right up front it makes giant assumptions. And all other bits of evidence flow from these assumptions. It does what lawyers call "assume facts not in evidence."</p>
<p>One assumption of fact is that there is something odd about the handkerchief. Why?  It doesn't strike me as odd if I left something behind someone would try to return it to me.  There is a giant leap here that this is coded language.  There is zero evidence for this other that the person's suspicion.  Zero.  Doesn't pass the smell test.</p>
<p>It then speculates on the thinnest example that if someone uses the word pizza they must be talking about pedophilia?  Really?  I use the word pizza like twice a week minimum.  So do tens of millions of other people.  </p>
<p>Puttanesca sauce doesn't seem unusual to me at all as I'm Italian and this Southern Italian red sauce with olives, capers and anchovies is very well known on restaurant menus in NYC.  Hell, Trader Joe's sells Puttanesca sauce.</p>
<p>All the other connections are only sinister in this light.</p>
<p>So what am I missing?  Where's the beef as they used to say.</p>
<p>PS.  New to reddit.  might get lost.</p></p>
