    So hey guys first time posting here. I got curious about tying in some previous incidences of weirdness and seeing if it all can trace back to pizzagate. These incidences happened in Louisiana over a period of at least 20 years. That puts at the time Arkansas Senator Bill Clinton a close neighbor to all this.
   </p>
   <p>
    <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/25/us/sex-charges-follow-a-churchs-collapse.html">
     in 2005 a Hosanna Church pastor in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana was charged with multiple charges of child rape. 8 other key members were charged including a deputy.
     <strong>
      THEY DID THIS UNDER SATANIC RITUALS
     </strong>
     His name and information online is hidden. Most local press was too ashamed I guess to write any details. Neither is there very much information on the other perpetrators. Actually there is nothing in the press. I would have to dig into actual court documents to unravel these names and the nature of these rituals, and more importantly who did they associate with.

   <p>
    <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Paul_Hebert">
     So I moved on to the big fish of lake Pontchartrain. Dennis Herbert was a democrat from this tiny parish serving on the district 73 of House of Representatives of Louisiana from 1972-1996. That is not far away from Bill Clinton during his prime years before potus.

     I wonder if Thomas Alfred Taylor knew any of these people.

     The Next Person I want to bring up is Gerald Theunissen who is also a democrat of that HoR of Louisiana. He left 1996 to serve as state senator when Bill was potus.

    I think there is more information. True detectives was based on this story. This church also had schools, this was a massive ring with state funds feeding it.

    Dude, that's crazy, I was just thinking of much the first season connects to all this mess. Damn good season of television I might add.

     Do any of you know how to access court docs online, or do you have to go to the actual district. Chances are they are all sealed too.

     The second season probably ties in to it as well... Elite sex parties, cover-ups, corruption

      I didn't watch past the first two episodes. I hated the tone shift.
