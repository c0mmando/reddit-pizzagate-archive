        <p><p>Two of the posts on the front page are extremely dubious.   One is audio of child screaming at Comet Ping Pong.   Um, have you ever been to a playground?   Children constantly scream when they play.  The other is a post about David Icke and reptile aliens.   The incredible Luzzatto stuff has way less upvotes.   Shills are almost certainly upvoting these posts to discredit us.  </p>
<p>Be smart people.   We are in the middle of a cyberwar.   If you want to talk about lizard people go find another fucking sub.   </p></p>

        <p><p>You are saying that the way to assure people that the sub has NOT been taken over by shills/CTR/acidfox is by... more censorship?</p>
<p>You are correct that we need more moderation. Things are out of hand. However too much and people freak out (like /u/Mods-equal-Cucks is)</p>
<p>I don't blame him/her (or anyone else). We're all a little paranoid right now. We are in the middle of a cyberwar. Cycling in "clean" (no PII) usernames is part of good opsec. Shitposting about being compromised doesn't help the war.</p>
<p>Anyone who has any concerns are welcome to come in an <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#pizzagate:matrix.org">join us in chat</a> where the opsec is good and we can resolve this and move forward.</p></p>

        <p><p>Something weird is going on with this sub (obviously). I haven't posted in here much at all and I was invited to be a mod of this sub last night. Take that info as you will but it smells to me like this place is compromised.</p></p>

        <p><p>You were invited to mod the wiki, nothing else.</p>
<p>You <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5d9zvo/guccifer_wanted_us_to_know_this_months_ago/">commented on this thread</a> yesterday, and you made good comments, and your comment history is pretty good (reasoned arguments on /r/conspiracy, VirtCoin).</p>
<p>And being a wiki mod isn't a compromise: if you had fucked around on it we would have noticed pretty quick.</p></p>

        <p><p>Just saying man, it pays to be suspicious with all of this going on. It was a random/seemingly sketchy request at the time. Echoing what I said in the mod messages yesterday, I urge you all to be careful. Seems to me like they would target the mods first.</p></p>

        <p><p>Good catch. Let's give them a bit to address it. These two should honestly be removed. We don't need more moderators here. </p>
<p>If it's not sufficiently addressed in a couple of hours we need to migrate and advertise that migration. Otherwise this sub is going to turn into a dead end quickly, and the majority of the sub won't realize it.</p></p>

        <p><p>On the chans it'd be under a digging megathread of some sort. I was referring to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dgtcn/hi_reddit_were_the_zsecio_team/">this</a> post though.</p></p>

        <p><p>I appreciate the info but I'm not downloading shit. I shouldn't have to. The mods should be transparent with their actions. All anyone really asks is that they explain when they lock a thread or add a mod with Full Permissions.</p></p>

        <p><p>Some mods that have been added are only for wiki so chill everyone. I am one myself. Sub is not compromised, I was able to push a 4K UPVOTE in this sub days before becoming mod</p></p>

        <p><p>The sub is fine. Just message the mods if you have concerns. They got back to me.</p></p>

        <p><p>They have been looking for mods since this place started booming.  I declined because with the crazy "coincidences" that keep happening I don't want to find out one day I am suicidal and shoot myself twice in the back of the head</p></p>

        <p><p>Explanation: We want to create new accounts which don't have as much PII. Basic opsec. Some of the mods are using older burner accounts and we want them to be able to protect themselves. Come chat off reddit. Most of the mods are on matrix. Come <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#pizzagate:matrix.org">into the reception room and have a chat</a></p>
<p>In the meantime I'm locking this. We honestly appreciate that we are being held accountable. Any further discussion about moderation or censorship needs to point to examples.</p></p>
