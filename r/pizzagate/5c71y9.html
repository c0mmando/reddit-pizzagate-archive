    While we have no fellowship with evil, the mind-control programmers are counting on us being so ignorant of
their devices that they can hide their control devices behind perversion &amp; filth that many people shy away from. (Pedophilia)

   <p>
    The first 3 minutes of the movie are about MKULTRA and splitting the mind.
   </p>
   <p>
    The flower in the apple refers to Dr Mengele heading over to the children plucking the flower:
   </p>
   <p>
    "Daddy loves you", "Daddy loves you not"
   </p>
   <p>
    If the last pluck is a leaf Daddy loves the child and he gives a hug. If the leaf is a "not" they skin the kid alive and murder it in front of the rest.
   </p>
   <p>
    This shit is real.

     How do you get these interpretations?  Maybe you know this stuff better than me.  But I can't find any references to Mengele and the flower story.

    In the book they are talking about the "domino's" method.
   </p>
   <p>
    It also states they prefer to be in contact with pedophiles because they have no ethics. Since abusing your own child is totally sick and increases chances of the parent selling the kid to the handlers.
   </p>
   <p>
    MKULTRA is still active guys.

     This makes even more sense, thank you, had a similar realization last night once I realized how easy it is to rewrite history. All of our education is meant to polarize our mind as if everything only has two choices. Crazy stuff.

     I think they work a lot in the porn space now.  I've seen some really weird mind control type compilation fast cut stuff that seems like it takes too much editing skill and expensive software for just the porn industry

    I haven't been down this rabbit hole in awhile but it is probably the scariest form of reality that I've ever given chance to. I found tie-ins with the Simulation Theory when I tried to separate myself from the Satanic brainwashing and ultimately had to quit research altogether because it was stressing me out. When you question reality or human existence, be prepared to find disturbing material.

      I was friends with a guy in high school who was openly gay and his parents sent him to one of those religious camps to "cure" him. He left for this camp right before senior year and disappeared for years. He appeared on Facebook when I was in my mid twenties and I attempted to reconnect with him. He started calling and texting at very early morning hours (5am) asking if I wanted to hang out and did this for two weeks straight. I finally agreed to meet up with him only to find out that he refuses to drive and will not leave his house. I reluctantly went to his house and it was a lone two bedroom at the end of a very long gravel road and an abandoned church about 500 ft from the house. I never got out of my vehicle(didn't even take the seatbelt off) and left the car running. He met me outside and when I tried to talk to him he would reply with off the wall shit. Never answered ANY questions, only replied with "Hahahaha I don't know! What do you think?" I even asked simple question about what color he liked and got the same answer. He kept handing me index cards face down and telling me not to read them until I was alone. They had random scriptures written on them that all pertained to animals. I looked at one while he was standing beside the car and he started flipping out but his voice had changed and he was telling me how I needed to meet his friends and talk about the Lord. It took awhile to get him away from the car so I could leave but I made it back home and started digging around. Both of his brothers, mom, dad, and many other close relatives didn't mention him ANYWHERE on their Social media until he got his own Facebook page. He wasn't in any family pictures, no mention of him at family gatherings or vacations. It was like the guy never existed but he did because I was friends with him and knew his family for years. I started looking at his mom's liked pages and came across one for family of schizophrenics. She posted a ton of stuff on their page relating to religion but nothing too personal. The creepiest part of this is that even people that were in our social circle in high school won't talk about him. I tried to ask questions and was shut down pretty quick and after the creepy encounter with him, his mom won't reply to my messages. In the pictures he posts online he's always in a room with cameras. There are security cameras in the corners and the rest of the room is pretty bare besides his bible and index cards. One of his older brothers commented on a picture someone tagged him in and mentioned he had stopped taking his meds but it was erased soon after. I started looking into religious cults which led to MKUltra, which led to all kinds of nonsensical crap but cats were mentioned quite a bit and this guy took on the personality of a cat often. His post would be random letters and numbers and then two hours later he would post a message saying he was sorry his words didn't make sense but his poor kitten paws can't use the keyboard. He would take a pic of his mouth with the caption of "look at my beautiful whiskers and sweet fuzzy nose" but he doesn't have facial hair. His brothers' instagram feeds are filled with cats alongside, what looks like, a relatively normal life. It's weird shit like this that makes me more open minded to the possibility of a bigger operation.

       Here are a few recent posts by him on Facebook. This is how he was talking to me the day I met up with him. Up until that point, besides the timing, nothing indicated he had any problems. He talked to me on the phone twice and texted on a daily basis for nearly two weeks prior to us meeting. Ever since then, 5yrs ago, he hasn't made any sense whatsoever.

      </p>
      <p>
       I think my dad is my soul. Why are people so conserved about that? He's a great guy and I love myself. You look at a tiger, "ahh, he's got stripes."
      </p>
      <p>
       What's a forehead? I'm not trying to be beautiful. Seriously.

    To everyone who keeps shitposting MKUltra links - great - but please show me who/how/why you are linking this to this particular case. You shouldn't say "I think we're talking about this" and reference nothing/no-one in particular.

      Please elaborate - who is a "handler" - and the way your sentence reads - pedophiles are selling the kids? I don't get it.

       Mindcontrol slaves have handlers; people who own the slave and programmed and control them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The handler group needs to be supplied with new children since they murder a lot of them. Here comes the cover:
      </p>
      <p>
       They act as if they are pedophiles. So when people like us discover we think we are dealing with a sex ring instead of a mind control program. (also in the book)
      </p>
      <p>
       People who abuse their children have no ethics. The handlers need slaves and are able to buy them from pedophiles for their program without the possibility the pedo's go to the police and bring them into the light.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all in the MKULTRA book.

        Often the handlers were abused as well, and may still be under mind control when abusing the victim, who is often their son/daughter. Certain genetic traits that make for a better candidate for mkultra are inheritable, so it is more effective and convenient to keep using the same family, generation after generation.

    God be with you all in these threads! This is spiritual warfare. If you are religious or not, realize that Satan is using these people. But remember that God is more powerful, and we need to come together as one, and learn that these things are very real.

       I recommend educating yourself on religion and spiritual matters before you form an opinion.  And furthermore, keep your mouth completely shut on the matter until then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding critical thinking skills, take your gratuitous commentary and stick it up your uneducated ass.

        Of course. I have an opinion that runs contrary to yours so I must be 'uneducated'. Never mind that questioning my knowledge of the subject saves you from having to form a coherent argument and allows you an unjustified air of superiority. I mean do you have a doctorate in theology? Some kind of Masters degree in religious studies? What's the minimum education level required to join the conversation? Even if you
        <em>
         did
        </em>
        know more about religion, it wouldn't make my question less valid.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before you resort to personal attacks, have a wee think. Do you even
        <em>
         have
        </em>
        a counter-point? Can you actually defend the inaction of your supposedly loving and benevolent dictator? I'm giving you a chance to enlighten me, here.

         I don't like your unnecessary commentary on my beliefs about God.  I have a lifetime of education on spiritual matters, along with some formal education, so my beliefs are well-founded.

          , you haven't used any of that education to address my point. If you're as educated as you seem to think, then an explanation for why god allows horrific things to happen to innocent children should be child's play.

            <em>
             mine
            </em>
            and you don't know how to respond to it.

           <p>
            In your lifetime of 'education' you didn't once stop to wonder why your loving creator would allow all of this horror in the first place? And if you did, why can't you just give me a straight answer about it?

    My wife is part of some facebook groups online and this guy was known to harass people from one of them fairly regularly.  His facebook profile creeped me out when i saw it the first time but now i just feel incredibly bad for him and angry.  He exhibits a lot of the symptoms of this kind of abuse.  Victims are everywhere.
