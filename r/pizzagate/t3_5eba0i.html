        <strong>Musicians are a key trail to follow!</strong>
        <p><p><em>EDIT</em>: This post has been flagged as misleading. Please explain why.</p>
<p>Instead of just a single video, I decided I would show you a few of the titles of videos from the artist of the one I linked earlier, to see what you think. </p>
<p>I would like to preface this by saying I don't normally find dark meaning even in dark music (I'm an atheist so you won't hear me calling everything "satanic" for example), but there are many coincidences here, that are worth getting more eyes on. At the high levels of this ring, the abuse allegedly ends with a sacrifice. My theory is that some artists, probably people abused themselves, are key players at rituals. I think voidloss is a good example to show you, but as I said to another commenter, what I am trying to do with this post is get autism on the musicians trail. Who has played at comet, or at the podestas, or any of the other key locations mentioned? That would be an important series of threads to unravel.</p>

<p>Ok, that should be enough to catch your attention this time.</p>
<p>Who is Voidloss? This is the summary from soundcloud: "Voidloss: " el caballero de lo oscuro" as they call him in Spain, is a producer much respected in the underground.
His musical life is extended, starting in industrial bands, moving on to putting on illegal raves as part of the seminal London underground counter cultural movement United Systems, through commercial techno and back into the murky underground of experimental/industrial techno.
Always known to be someone working on the fringes, in the shadows, a true underground artist, Voidloss has become a name associated with progression, a high production aesthetic, emotional extremes, of euphoria and darkness, with iconic releases on both high profile and underground labels. His own label Singularity Recordings pushes forward and explores the dark and experimental, leading edge of techno, championing other artists working with a similar aesthetic of uniquity, artistry and underground mentality.
His Live PA`s take people on a deep emotional journey, both for the soul and for dancefloor, breaking genre rules, remaining ahead of expectation. And his releases and label philosophy continue to be a strong force for individuality and dissent amongst a sea of compliance."</p></p>

        <p><p>I doubt it, his scene seems to be, allegedly, at the actual ritual sites, and in primarily the EU. What I would suggest though is that you find who has performed at comet and follow their trail. I bet you will find juicy things.</p></p>
