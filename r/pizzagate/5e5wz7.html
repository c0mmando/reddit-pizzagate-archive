    What I think the end goal is and why sex ed is potentially very dangerous
   </strong>

   <p>
    Warning I am theorizing something no evidence yet.
   </p>
   <p>
    So I saw the Aus 60m segment on the British Pedo ring and what caught my attention was when he talked to the convicted pedo and his insistence on consent and how you could receive/give signs to the child to obtain said consent. The interviewer goes and says "In your book you said a sign is complimenting a younger girl about her knickers while she sits in your lap". The guy becomes very upset with the interviewer when he resisted his claim she could consent and stormed out.

     Here it is if you want to see the interview

   <p>
    So this got me thinking and I realized two things the first is we have a push to teach sex ed as a course to children. They want it to start as early as possible and teach them about transgenderism and other things so kids can go through sex change at an earlier age. Now to me sex ed just needs to be a 30 minute speech covering safe sex and how to practice it in a gender neutral form.
   </p>
   <p>
    They want a curriculum class but why? Well with this pedo sick shit coming out I am theorizing their goal is to teach them about consent and teach children to pick up signs given by sexual predators. Now after this is implemented their signs will not just be recognized by other sick individuals but by children and the goal is normalization after a few generations of exposed students.
   </p>
   <p>
    2nd thing is If we go back to Roman-Greek society this behavior has always been common place by the elites. They thought young boys should learn of sex by older males and secret societies at times draw their origins to this time if not earlier. The Catholic church which is one of the oldest western institutions has been embroiled with this issue so we can legitimately suspect this has been a normal although secretive practice.
   </p>
   <p>
    I do believe most of those sick fucks have also been victimized when they were younger and enjoyed their abuse so they can justify passing it down. I am really starting to believe this shit has been around us our whole life (maybe history). Just today I saw an older man with his arm wrapped around an young boy who returned the embrace going into his apartment building. What stood out was this guy golden watch and advanced age, I mean it could just be an affectionate grandpa but I will remain vigilant in public. Btw I live in Brazil the older guy was white and the kid he was with was brown skinned, could be his grandchild but I remain skeptical of what I was witnessing I just know he looked at me and grinned before looking away. I do live in a resort town that get a lot of elites visit and there is a masonic temple in town. I grew up among them so they do respect my name even though we have never entered any secret societies

    We've seen a lot of connections about the far left pushing for the inclusion of pedophilia rights as the next major milestone.  I'm not sure how connected it is to the rest of this mess though, so for now probably best to leave it at the door.

     As I said I am just theorizing but the age they want to introduce is what really alarms me. We can see how successful at brainwashing they have been so giving them a platform to get to children at young ages would be the equivalent of letting a fox in the hen house

     like the most recent DSM stating pedophilia was just a sexual preference, and then they retracted the statement after their backlash and republished and replaced the already printed copies...
