        <strong>Taking guesses why he's resigning now? Maybe because he's going to be exposed for covering up Pizzagate all these years?</strong>

        <p><p>He's been in the position for fifty years, continuously.  I'm not saying he's involved, but it would be a bad position to hold, when someone (inevitably) exposes the ugly protection racket going on.</p></p>

        <p><p>If that were the case why would he resign instead of try to remain in the office? This is nonsense.</p></p>

        <p><p>It might look better to resign than be fired.  Not to say your theory is incorrect (I have few doubts that you are), but we have little information on this so we won't know until we do more research.  If you can tie him to something, that might help support this theory. </p></p>
