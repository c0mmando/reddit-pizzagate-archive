<strong>A thought : possible explanation for using pizza shops as cover ups</strong>
<p><p>Well, this might sound far fetched or already said, but it seems to me that these people use pizza as front may be because pizza shops come usually with pretty large ovens (that could not be found in regular restaurants) and large fridges (#killroom) to store or do whatever. </p></p>

<p><p>I actually think that tgese threads are shill threads that are now mass produced to discredit good work done here and water out the whole thing.</p>
<p>I think we should have a megathread for these sort of questions/brainfarts and mods should lock these threads right away.</p></p>

<p><p>Well it's just weird that posts like these are popping up so much it's hard to determine who's being serious and who's not. Who's actually trying to find answers and who's pushing us down a alley with no answers.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm not sure if this is a shill or not so I'll take this one seriously.  If you want to discuss an establishment that is in every town, then their front could easily be a mortuary.  They are everywhere, have cadaver storage, and crematoriums.  Makes a whole lot more sense.  </p></p>

<p><p>Yes that was kind of what I was thinking, and the mortuary makes sens! But to my knowledge mortuaries can't be private property, so you can't come and go as you please. But then again, if this thread is irrelevant, I can delete it right away, I was just trying to make assumptions with what we know</p></p>

<p><p>No need to delete, others might find it interesting.  If not, just let them down vote it away.  My take on the pizza situation is as simple as it comes.  There are various ones in most towns, has revolving clientele, and can easily be cash only/cash heavy for money laundering.  </p>
<p>You could swap child abuse with drug running with hit men, anything illicit and a pizza parlor is a great front</p></p>
