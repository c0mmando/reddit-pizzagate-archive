    There is a sub called r pedo friends...I discovered this weeks ago while trying to figure out why so many people on reddit are pedo apologists. I attempted to browse the sub to get a better understanding but could not make it past the first few post titles..I knew I would get banned for asking for a mass suicide. Might be something there..might be nothing.

    I thank yall for your hard work.

    From the pedophiles perspective it's actually normally to have sex with a child. We do have to remember most of them are sexual abuse survivors themselves, just trying to see how their minds work. They are essentially trying to "normalize" their sick behavior until it's accepted, at least that's how I understand it

     Makes sense...at least to them. One of the mods from that sub came to my askreddit question and tried to tell me that most do not want to offend. An that sub is there to help that. So I tried to be non objective. It made me sick.

    Many were literally brainwashed. I know that sounds crazy but for the people who have been studying this for years it's really clear that most of them are victims themselves. It's the people like Podesta and Epstein and Clinton who are super rich and never have any consequences that are responsible for much of the mess.

    I mean if you haven't come to terms with he fact that there have been wide spread mind control operations going on since at least the 60s then you should start looking into it. This is a part of that in my opinion.

     I am aware of Mk Ultra and definitely do not believe they ever stopped. Never thought to put some of these people in the same category. I just figured they had a genetic defect and were sick fucks.  Crazy world we live in.

      The reason you will find that many perpetrators were once victims themselves is because it is carried on from generation to generation.  So, yes, they torture their own kids.The monarch project verified the link between genetic memory and dissociative ability also. Many a programmer/handler was once (and really still is) a slave.

      Ok to be sure every pedophile is not an mkultra subject. There is definitely some physical aspect to pedophilia being linked to abnormalities in the brain present from birth. Those are genuine pedophiles who may or may not end up abusing kids but do suffer from a pretty clear disorder because they are attracted to children even when they are ashamed of it and wish that they were not attracted to them.
     </p>
     <p>
      But when you see it organized to any extent or in groups then I think there is a high likelihood of it being mkultra/delta/monarch related. I guess my main thing I was wanting to say is this is much worse and more nefarious than simply pedophilia. It's really an entirely separate issue in my opinion.
