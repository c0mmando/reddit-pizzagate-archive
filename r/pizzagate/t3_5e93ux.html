<p>Some quick updates: Aiming for a 4:00 pm start on Sunday May 24, rain date is May 25. As we've done this before, organizing is a bit easier -- we'll have music spinning at the west end in Arno's garage and activities throughout alley (including ping pong behind our house); Bell's driveway will be food central but feel free to set up coolers/tables where you see a need; trampoline will be open but no moonbounce as of yet; water balloon battle expected to happen again (sure Leon would welcome help with the 500+ balloons he filled last year); Martha and I will make a run to Costco at some point to get a supply of hotdogs, veggie burgers, hamburgers, buns, drinks etc. ($20 contribution usually covers cost). Feel free to invite others around the 'hood, just because we have the best alley doesn't mean we can't be welcoming to folks not so fortunate :) This folder <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7OGS0rnec72MjNLTWFmanVDMUk/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7OGS0rnec72MjNLTWFmanVDMUk/view?usp=sharing</a> has a house/name map and a schedule of activities. Everyone should be able to edit the docs in the folder. Please email me with ideas or key contributions (e.g., Matt and Julie have signed up already for the very important category of ice cream novelties). Looking forward to it! Damian </p>

<p>This could be nothing and noticed that two dates were mentioned</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Now since its a sunday event why would the event last until 25th or why would they even speak of 'rain for monday' if most of these people have work on the monday? This could be a sign that rain date is some sort of ritual at the usual time (mid night) what ever that may be</p>
<p>Also to note that ping pong was mentioned and so was ice cream novelities which I thought was suspicious.  As well as the mention of 'moonbounce' which could be another code word regarding the satanic worship</p>
<p>Whats others thoughts on this?</p></p>

        <p><p>It is pretty common to have an alternate date for an outdoor event. He is stating that in-case of rain we'll reschedule for May 25.
However, this part stands out to me personally:
'Leon would welcome help with the 500+ balloons he filled last year'
He filled 500+ balloons last year? With What and did they just keep 500+ full balloons for a whole year?</p></p>

        <p><p>I agree the way that is constructed doesn't make much sense. I did think that's what a rain date would be but as mentioned I thought these politicians are working a normal monday-friday job so ruled it out</p></p>
