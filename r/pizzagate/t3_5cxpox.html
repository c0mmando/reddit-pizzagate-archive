        <p><p>Vice is connected big time. Russia knows it too. In their special on north korea labor camps located in russia, they arrive at their hotel only to have the front desk staff tell them the fsb had requested to know when the vice crew checked it (could be nothing, but as the story continues it gets fishier.).... vice does an emmy nominated special on isis (who was created by hillary/obama)...now how thr fuck does a journalist from a us company not get held hostage and beheaded?  (Because they were put there by the us gov). </p>
<p>So I typed in vice news in wikileaks....vice news was pushing stories based on essays written by GEORGE SOROS. Also. The head of vice was with one of the clintons when some one in the middle east offered to let them use their plane to fly somewhere. </p></p>
