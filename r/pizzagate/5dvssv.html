   <strong>
    The McCann police sketches cannot be the Podesta brothers and here's why. Those two sketches are supposed to be of ONE MAN.
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    We've all seen the uncanny resemblence between the sketches of the two men and the Podesta brothers. It's SO uncanny how much they look like the Podesta brothers. (I showed a friend who knew nothing of this case and he honestly thought the sketches were made from photos of the Podesta brothers.)
   </p>
   <p>
    So I tried to go back in time to when the sketches were released and find out more about who provided the info to the police about these men, etc.
   </p>
   <p>
    Below is a link to a 2013 article when the sketches were first released and what jumped out at me is that they are
    <strong>
     two versions of sketches of ONE MAN. Not two men.
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    "Police have issued two efits that they believe are descriptions of the same man, who is now being sought as a priority by the British detectives leading the new McCann inquiry."
   </p>
   <p>
    https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/14/british-detectives-efits-madeleine-mccann-suspect
   </p>
   <p>
    Given this piece of information, I wonder if someone just noted how the two sketches side-by-side look like the Podesta brothers and decided to fire off this rumor?
   </p>
   <p>
    What do you all make of this?

      That was icing on the cake.  The "it was one guy" defense tactic is plastered on the wall of the CTR office.  They had this shaky argument planned before this info even leaked.  The first threads on Reddit regarding the Podesta e-fits had them shilling the same nonsense with newly created accounts.  For me, it just confirms the evidence.  I should be thanking CTR for their stupidity just like we should be thanking the establishment for picking Hillary as their presidential candidate.

       I've read many many threads arguing the "one person" sketch idea.  Is there definitive evidence either way?  Why is this a debate, instead of solid fact one way or the other??

        No, because the entire investigation is shit.
       </p>
       <p>
        These shitheads have had 9 years to disseminate disinfo, blur the story, plant false evidence, witnesses, etc.
       </p>
       <p>
        These sketches though, I believe they are legit.
       </p>
       <p>
        The connection/relationship to a known child rapist living 3 miles from the scene, is legit.
       </p>
       <p>
        The probability they were involved? Mind-boggling high.
       </p>
       <p>
        THE SKETCH EVEN HAD MOLESTA'S FACE MOLE
       </p>
       <p>
        The sketches were suppressed, for 5 gd years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sketches alone make them persons of interest.
       </p>
       <p>
        Edit: Fuck, the placement of that mole makes Tony a suspect.

         Wasn't trying to second guess their potential involvement, I'm only asking about the supposed "1 suspect sketch".  Seems like it would be easy to clear up, I'm confused why that's a debate

    And here's a report from the same day (Oct 14, 2013), claiming multiple kidnappers. The video claims just one, however.

    Edit: Also, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c3f26M8-Q . If the police knew, they
    <em>
     could
    </em>
    have made efits from actual photos.

     The only thing those two sketches have in common is that they're both caucasian.

     If they're of one man then they're worthless.

    There are so many discrepancies in the investigation, and so much disinfo out there.
   </p>
   <p>
    The sketches are legit, multiple eyewitnesses saw multiple men, multiple times.
   </p>
   <p>
    Do not allow opinion pieces, or lone pieces of information, to influence the mountain of evidence suggesting otherwise.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Podesta's even had a friend that lived 3 miles from the scene. Who is a
    <strong>
     known pedophile
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Seriously. There are coincidences, but after the 50th, or 60th coincidence, you can no longer dismiss them as illegitimate and should be seriously questioning how far and wide their corruption has spread.
   </p>
   <p>
    Even this subreddit is showing signs of disinfo and shills. It's okay to ask questions, to criticize information/evidence provided, but dismissing it outright is aiding child rapists. That cannot be allowed.
   </p>
   <p>
    And for those shills that have penetrated this subreddit, fuck you. There will be a new ring of hell created and reserved for those who aid and assist in the molestation of innocent children, and I will personally see to it that you are served what you deserve. After all, as a non-believer I'll be joining you in the lake of fire.

    I remember reading somewhere that the claim is of two people, not one and I even downloaded the source, here you go, I am not aware how good the source is though. It definitely claims two people.

    "Descriptions of the suspect were given to the Portuguese inquiry by two witnesses after Madeleine disappeared."
   </p>
   <p>
    2 witnesses - did they witness this person seprately? In which case it could be two different people in the e-fit.
