        <strong>Why are STRATFOR employees setting up a gateway for ordering pizza?</strong>

<p><strong>testing the Pizza Pages</strong> - your list</p>
<p><strong>As of today we are able to test the new credit card landing pages</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Pizza).</strong></p>
<p>We have until the end of the week to find as many bugs / errors / <strong>weird
stuff before launching to real visitors.</strong> Below you'll find a list of
questions I've come up with that i need your help in thoroughly testing.
These questions are tailored specifically toward your department and we
are relying on you to find any problems. </p>
<p>As you go through the different scenarios please take notes on <strong>anything
that seems weird</strong> or doesn't work. </p>
<p><strong>Additionally, If you just notice something that doesnt make sense</strong> (even if
it's not on on your question list), make a note. </p>
<p>To reduce clutter, all feedback should be sent directly to me as soon as
possible. <strong>Do not open any new IT tickets. </strong></p>
<p>Please use as many web browsers as you have available. </p>
<p>If you end up in the "Original" Credit Card campaign version, in order to
see the new version you'll have to clear your stratfor cookies and refresh
the page. <strong>Once you have the Pizza version</strong> You should be able to view all
campaign pages in the new version, even if you close your browser and come
back later. </p>
<h2>Your Questions - Service Dept</h2>
<p>1) Are test pages (both A &amp;B versions) pushing the right data to iPay?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>refcode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>modality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>price</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>address</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premium attached? Shipping? (only on newly created campaign pages)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which version of the campaign page they came from (old or new)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2) <strong>International Orders being processed properly?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What about any common <strong>international order processing</strong> issues? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does postal code box map to the right spot in ipay? </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3) Does the <em>Questions</em> tile work?</p>
<p>4) does the page show as secure in all browsers (SSL?)</p>
<hr>
<p>Any idea what this means? They are an intelligence firm are they not? Also have seen Pizza mentioned in emails from USAID and Stratfor. What gives? Even if it was pizza, who ships pizza internationally?</p>
<p>ANYONE willing to help, please try and use this lead, I don't know where else to go with it but it could be something. </p></p>

        <p><p>International ordering for pizza? Because that's normal. Seems like this story is gathering some momentum. We need to keep this going. </p></p>

        <p><p>1)  they are asking for a headcount on how many people want to split ONE slice of PIZZA?!?!</p>
<p>2) he says this message is "color-coded black and white" - same colors as podestas pedo hankerchief  (BLACK=S&amp;M / WHITE=VIRIGN or CHILD)</p>
<p>3) he says to respond "Simply send a single response, filed, color-coded, double-sided and
appropriately labeled, signed in triplicate and set on fire."       </p>
<p>Why would they need to sign it 3 times on color coded paper and burn it&gt;&gt;??
Is that some ritual shit?</p>
<p>FUCK LEAVING THIS HERE - THIS DESERVES IT'S OWN POST </p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, I noticed that too. That isn't a normal way to speak, it isn't clear what they mean, but with  all the links to pizza and that realtor email it makes perfect sense. </p></p>

        <p><p>this seems pretty important.</p>
<p>1) https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/19/19480_re-headcount-for-pizza-.html</p>
<p><strong>"This e-mail is color-coded in black and white and will combust in 30
seconds"</strong></p>
<p>2) https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55433 </p>
<p><strong>"I just came from checking the Field house and I have a square cloth handkerchief (white w/ black) that was left on the kitchen island.
Happy to send it via the mail if you let me know where I should send it."</strong>
3) Back to the first email:</p>
<p><strong>Who all is in the Austin office today who is going to want pizza? We
only have one slice and we need to know how thinly to slice it...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Simply send a single response, filed, color-coded, double-sided and
appropriately labeled, signed in triplicate and set on fire.</strong></p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief_code</p>
<p>People have suspected the handkerchief is suspicious, it's been talked about a lot. Just interesting how the 'black and white' in relation to pizza has come up twice now. And then they mention color coding AGAIN, in relation to pizza.</p>
<p>And of course the "we only have one slice", could be a joke, could be referencing something else.</p></p>

        <p><h1>A NOTE OF CAUTION</h1>
<p><strong>(with regard to posting PizzaGate related info to other subs)</strong></p>
<p>Please take care to not waste your time when posting discussion or links to other subs.  This material is being deleted in many of them as it is posted, including (I suspect) the use of bots to pseudo-shadowban the comments of certain users (I'm looking at you /r/OutOfTheLoop )</p>
<p>A good way to guard against this is to try and open your comment links in another browser (or in a "private window" if you're using firefox.) Basically, a browser with a different cookie set.  This will allow you to see whether your comments and posts are appearing at all.</p>
<p>I think they're using this technique to get us to waste a lot of time and energy.</p></p>

        <p><p>I would assume the_donald wouldn't have it anyways, that was their MO at least during election time, they were suggesting we post all Pizzagate evidence to /r/hillaryforprison, but I'll post it to conspiracy too, I would post on /pol/ but my posts never get traction. </p>
<p>Thanks for the heads up too!</p></p>

        <p><p>Well, it's not ALL censored to the eye balls.  It's worth testing a post, and seeing what happens in these threads.</p>
<p>I CAN say /r/OutOfTheLoop was actively suppressing posts (and users) that tried to make a case for why this issue has any merit.</p></p>

        <p><p>Besides the leaks about Stratfor from Wikileaks did they not have a gigantic database leak a few years ago including their entire subscriber base leaked done by a hacking group with no connection to the Wikileaks material? You might be able to find that database on some other torrent search engine.</p>
<p>Get that database and other information do a search for people who have no reason to be subscribed to a intelligence spook website/service. For example like a plumbing contractor or the head of the parks or forest service.</p>
<p>If they are using Stratfor as a way to communicate somehow I would think someone spending 300 dollars a year to subscribe plus "other services" would be a huge red flag. If they work at a job or no connections to the intelligence industry.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>
<p>Yea it looks like they had 200 god dammed gigabytes ripped from their servers. Some or all of it was handed over to Wikileaks. So for you guys who are into IT or computer professionals know full well what we have seen from Wikileaks is the .0001% of what they have on Stratfor.</p>
<p>The real question is what did they hand over and if they kept anything back from Wikileaks.</p></p>
