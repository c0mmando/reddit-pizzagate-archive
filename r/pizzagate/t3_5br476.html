<strong>Island Connections</strong>
<p><p>I thought it would be pertinent to search the Podesta e-mails for the term "island" and see what I find, mostly to see if I can find little hints or clues linking back to the supposed compound in Honolulu.</p>
<p>I did find this one e-mail: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/52766</p>
<p>"Fwd: FW: Island energy budget"</p>
<p>Rather than copy the entire thing here, I will talk about some interesting things about the contents of the e-mail.</p>
<p>First of all, things are worded somewhat vaguely. There is a lot of the sort of hushed-tone corporate speak that is intended to protect the contents of conversations while referring to them. Very natural business language overall. But also very natural white collar (or other types) criminal language.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it's about clean energy programs on islands. There would be involved an island in the Caribbean, an island in the Pacific Rim, and an island in the India Ocean.</p>
<p>Now, we have connected some organized pedophile activities to Haiti, isn't that right? And that is an island in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>And we have connected some organized pedophile activities to Hawaii, is that correct? And that is an island in the Pacific Rim.</p>
<p>So let's see. In this big global human trafficking scheme, you get yourself another island to "hop" a bit further west again, in the India Ocean. Now you have a chain, a logistic chain allowing you to move children in two directions from the middle east and Indonesia (and India, and Australia,) to a bridge where Hawaii and Haiti are the foundations and it lets you pick up / drop off anywhere in Central- and northern South America. Think El Salvador, Argentina (a long drive but still 'right there'), places with a regular rate of disappearances.</p>
<p>Then look up the coast, the east coast of America: they also apparently have Martha's Vineyard fully in their grasp. You go east and it gets to be a bit of a hard slog with some really cold temperatures. But if you can get past it, you end up in some real far-out, tiny, very secluded and very reclusively populated islands such as the Hebrides.</p>
<p>My thinking is they are looking for a way to trace from the UK (where there are massive trafficking rings) over east into the "sotadic zone" (where pedophilia is just a commonplace thing and you can safely traffick children all the way down to the Indian Ocean) and then east, east, east back to America, with staging grounds and snatch points in Hawaii, Haiti, and Martha's Vineyard. They could avoid having to fly north across the Atlantic or to deal with stricter NATO shipping regulations for their containers full of children bumping around with some MREs and buckets to shit in.</p>
<p>This whole thing about spreading $1million dollars (a rather nominal sum isn't it) across three entire islands for an "energy budget"?</p>
<p>That would not purchase a whole hell of a lot of energy panels, generators, and that sort of thing. Not in any way that's going to impress the local natives and get them petitioning their government for changes in the national energy policies. BUT, it very likely WOULD provide plenty of energy-self-sufficiency to just three specific compounds.</p>
<p>Why islands? Because most islands have potions where it is readily apparent that they are "sea mounts", that is you have bedrock right there just under the soil. And if you're building a compound that's sort of what you want is something solid to build into. As long as you can drain it if it's porous enough to let water seep in (and at that rate, the more porous rock can be in some ways easier to shape, since porosity and permeability are related.)</p>
<p>Another thing related to digging into rock is right back to energy production; you can extract gases and oils from drilling into seamounts. It's why there are all these disputed Asian islands. That means you can cover digging and extractions under such an "energy budget" as well. And that includes extractions and disposal of rock material, typically you'd want to sell it to someone but sometimes with some rock you actually have to pay someone to haul it away. It depends on what's present in the rock.</p>
<p>You can also fit laying pipeline, wastewater line, and nearly anything else "infrastructure"-related into an "energy budget" and palm it off on congress, donors, whomever's looking (if anyone even is -- $1mil is not a lot of money when we're talking about these kinds of terms, the building of infrastructure.) People have even gone so far as to try and tie nuclear weapons silos to "energy budgets" by way of the whole "nuclear energy is the same as nuclear power" mislead.</p>
<p>But yeah $1mil is just enough to create 3 little "proof of concepts", with the loving help of donors who supply "connections to private property" so that the solar panels / generators / "infrastructure" can be put in place according to budget and okayed by local authorities, and when time comes to ask "so how's it all turning out" the private property owner can give a big thumbs up, show how off-the-grid they are thanks to these panels and generators, and decline any requests to come take a closer look at the property. Especially if it's related to a business that can claim trade secrets such as liquor making.</p>
<p>That's an important footnote to all of this. When you're talking about following the money, and trafficking of any kind, rule one is you find the "front".</p></p>

<p><p>One way police catch grow-ops is by the massive energy bill. So being off grid would be important if you had a 'storage' bunker for the trafficking.</p></p>
