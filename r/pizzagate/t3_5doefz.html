<title>James Alefantis IMDB Page is worth a look. "SECRET PIZZA" is apparently the big plot reveal in the movie. He's produced two others. Worked with some big names. Also some crew have pedo vibe projects. Go figure</title>

<p><p>First rule: There are no accidents in filmmaking. Everything is placed by design... including the <a href="https://twitter.com/caesuramedia">studio's</a> illuminati logo hanging in the car 42 seconds in. </p>
<p>Reference to <a href="http://deoxy.org/narbystew.htm">Jeremy Narbin</a> and Cosmic Serpent, which purports our DNA holds secrets of the universe. Guy has a red armband on his right arm on what appears to be a military-like costume. </p>
<p>Main character is named Levi, which might be a reference to the famous occultist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliphas_Levi">Eliphas Levi</a>. The main character is also, strangely, wearing a Barack Obama shirt (you can see it clearly at 2:31). </p>
<p>3:09: Weird "L" hand gesture, but I don't know the symbolism of it. He does it while pointing to light and crystal chandelier, so that might be reference to bringing knowledge. </p>
<p>4:11: Painting of woman with a serpent. In Satanism, the snake is the bringer of knowledge to the people, which apparently is why God cast him out (as he wanted to be the single provider of knowledge and retain power. So Satanists say, anyway).</p>
<p>4:13: Levi browsing... pictures of kids(??) and a... some painting?</p>
<p>5:58: Begins presentation on "junk DNA" (part of our DNA which scientists can't attribute to any use). Goes back to cosmic serpent. Says he can decode the secret language. Shows painting, The Vale of Rest (symbol of death). Mentions musical artist "Sun Awaw (7:49), which literally translates to "sacred rest." Lots of death meaning, then. </p>
<p>8:06: Guy opens his package, there's a snake in it. They begin meditation as snake slithers off. Talks about "becoming the other." Trippy flashes, starts seeing skeletons. They're in "Day of the Dead" celebration and Sun Araw concert.</p>
<p>9:02: Presenter asks if Levi "feels the horns on his head." Tells him he's a "modern day moses." Says it's coded in his DNA. Now baphomet horns are on his head. </p>
<p>11:25: Reaches his hand up to the sun (likely sun worshipping gesture). </p>
<p>Comes back in to warn him he'll see burning bush and other religious symbols. Not to panic. </p>
<p>12:12: Turns and sees woman with snake, deep chanting sound which sort of reminds me of meditation chants. I couldn't place the frequency, though. </p>
<p>So.... this is straight up occultism. At best it's left hand magick, at worst, it's satanic (these two have overlap in philosophies but can be different). For Levi to turn into Baphomet, while then being told he was like Moses, is inversion. It's also telling him that he is a god, which is why I'm not sure if this is left-hand magick or Satanism because it fits the definition of both. </p>
<p>Based on all of these factors... Satanism. </p></p>

<p><p>I was thinking of Icke's stuff when I read the synopsis part, "dimensional shifting." Apparently the goal of feeding off kids is to get in a vibrational alignment that brings them back to their own lower dimension. </p></p>

<p><p>I have watched Chapel perilous (one of the film in this list)
Definitly a weird short movie, with many satanic reference, and psychdelic/reality stuff. It's freaky. </p>
<p>Other movie seems just as bizarre, based on the synopsis. Seems to me James got some weird obsession going.
About Automatic at sea, i can't find anything at all.</p></p>

<p><p>Yes I can. It'S only 13 minutes long. So basically, one stranger come to a house to sell something, but turn out he's just.. hypnotizing them or something, performing some kind of ritual which bring them to another world, (what happens there remind me of bohemian grove) after they come back, the ''main character'' have horns and the ending is just him sitting on a chair sipping juice. yep.</p></p>

<p><p>Man, this stuff is indeed freaky.  Saw the other short, Chapel Perilous and was curious as to what do you guys make of it?  Shit is riddled with symbolism.  Anything you guys might deem noteworthy? </p>
<p>I also don't know what to make of the director, 'Matthew Lessner'.  Checked out some of his other work and the dude is woke for sure.  Just not sure his role is in all this.  I wanna say hes interested in all this freaky deaky dutch stuff like we are (given the nature and themes of his shorts) but the relation to James has me on the fence.</p></p>

<p><p>lots of occult symbolism. The book referenced during the presentation is real. Its about a Dr. who thinks the junk DNA all humans have is code to either shape shift or be able to communicate with Lizard beings. </p></p>
