        <p><p>I'm so glad light is getting shown on this. We need definitive proof though. A handful of creepy pictures and paintings can't prove that anyone's guilty of anything. We can hope that the FBI will investigate him, but that might take so long that, especially now that he's been tipped off, he can get rid of any evidence.</p>
<p>Everyone's doing a great job of finding a bunch of potential leads that branch out, but those aren't necessarily time-sensitive to pursue. I feel like we need solid evidence on him asap if we want him to be held accountable. Idk what that would be or how to get it, but what we have now isn't going to be enough. </p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5edfhu/how_do_we_get_solid_evidence_on_alefantis/">I made a separate post</a></p></p>

        <p><p>Might have been in Phase 3 of the promised Wikileaks releases, which they said would be the end of Hillary. Which might tie into JA's subsequent quiet disappearance, no further releases and recent outcry against fake news and such. </p>
<p>The evidence is out there and we just need to keep getting the word out so more and more people will dig until we find it. </p></p>

        <p><p>Agreed, Assange almost certainly had something huger-than-huge on Hillary. But wikileaks is likely compromised, we can't expect to ever see whatever it was they had.</p></p>

        <p><p>We had FBI anon post the leaks on 4chan. </p>
<p>I'm starting to think this is all planned, maybe on oct 16th Trump or someone close to him did pick up Assange and told him not to move forward until trump was President. However John Kearry was pressuring the ecuatorian embassy. Either way I'm going to remain hopeful about Assange until feb. next year</p></p>

        <p><p>It's great people are investigating this, but then you get all the idiots going and making accusations on their social media pages and now they've been alerted to the threat. They make their pages private, wipe up the evidence and then we're fucked. At this point we need to rely on the corrupt government agencies to collect further evidence because we screwed up and couldn't do this somewhat covertly and more civilised. This is why these communities get labelled as conspiracy nut jobs.</p></p>

        <p><p>Douglas Ernst . Don't forget that name, the article is in his name, let's just hope they don't try to do anything to silence him or force him to change his narrative on the article.</p></p>

        <p><p>Tried pasting this article to comet pizza fb page but seems that I can't leave a review with this link on it. Not even blocked from the page, it's saying that it is deemed abusive and not aloud to post. Anyone know a way to circumvent this problem?</p></p>
