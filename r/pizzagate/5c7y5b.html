    So i don't know if this means anything, but it gave me the fuckin creeps so here it is for you guys to debunk and maybe give me some peace of mind:

    the woman who wrote that article, Judy Byington, seemed to run that website, as well as a twitter and facebook profile by the same name.  She also wrote a book called Twenty Two Faces
https://www.amazon.com/Twenty-Two-Faces-Judy-Byington/dp/1620240327
Largely discreditted from my brief google searches but after what went down this election and learning that south korea was under occult rule idk what to think anymore.
    <br/>
    Read this bio:
Judy Byington, MSW, LCSW, ret, has dedicated her life to humanizing and raising public awareness about the little-known effects of ritual abuse and mind control programming that tragically cause formation of multiple personalities in children. The retired CEO of Provo Family Counseling Center, Supervisor over Childrens Services for Alberta Mental Health, therapist and author of "Twenty-Two Faces: Inside the Extraordinary Life of Jenny Hill and Her Twenty-Two Multiple Personalities" is founder and leader of the Trauma Research Center. She spent twenty years in research with Jenny Hill while interviewing hundreds of ritual abuse survivors, legal entities, therapists, families of missing children and religious, media and community leaders. With a compelling drive to educate the public on the unimaginable horrors faced by children born into families practicing ritual abuse, Byington continues to pen books about survivors like Jenny Hill who suffer repressed childhood memories of forced participation in rape, torture and murder. Byington's upcoming book, "Saints, Sinners and Satan" encompases a first-person account of her own experiences with multiple personality survivors and satanic crime."

    Kim Noble's art seems to pop up a lot as i've been reading what you guys have been digging up...
   </p>
   <p>
    https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/sep/30/kim-noble-woman-with-100-personalities
   </p>
   <p>
    "The strangeness of Kim's story and something of what she has endured is revealed in her autobiography, All Of Me. The book, ghostwritten by Jeff Hudson, is a terrible tale. Kim was born in 1960. Her parents, stuck in an unhappy marriage, were factory workers, and the care of their daughter was farmed out to friends and local acquaintances. The details of what happened are hazy, but it seems that from an early age – somewhere between one and three – Kim suffered extreme and repeated abuse. And at this point her mind, traumatised beyond endurance, shattered into fragments, forming myriad separate identities. The breaks were clean: most of the principal personalities had no memories of abuse and no flashbacks. Thus she was protected from what had happened."

    They just seem... awfully similar... maybe its nothing.

    has any veracity, this sort of thing seems to be common in the US as well. It was also mentioned in one of the articles about Nicole Kidman's father as something that happened in Australia as well.
