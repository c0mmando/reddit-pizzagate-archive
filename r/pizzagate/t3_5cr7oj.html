<blockquote>
<p>Also starting now, every appropriate MMFA item will include contact information for the offending media institution. We encourage you to use our research to hold specific broadcast, cable, print, and radio outlets accountable for their actions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally, our first Internet ad campaign is intended to cut through the misleading spin being injected into the media by conservatives who accuse "liberals" of being "wild-eyed," full of rage, and reckless in their vigorous political protestations. Our Flash animation reminds viewers who truly is guilty of hateful, angry, divisive rhetoric: conservatives like Rush Limbaugh, who recently said women "actually wish" to be sexually harassed; Michael Savage, who said lesbians are "jealous" of AIDS; and Bill O'Reilly, who said the poor are "irresponsible and lazy." MMFA's animated Flash ad, "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040807024729/http://mediamatters.org/static/right-wing-squares.html">The Right-Wing Squares</a>," uses actual audio clips of conservative claims -- with a dash of humor mixed in -- to make the point.</p>
