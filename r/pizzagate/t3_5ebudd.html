<strong>Might be some helpful data</strong>
<p><p>I'm new here on pizzagate, and this is my burner account since many of you warned to use one. I found an interesting article on the BBC regarding the numbers of child trafficking in the UK. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37982221 there's that. I found a ton of articles linking a rise in child trafficking in Europe with an increase in disappearances in children's homes. A teacher was found attempting to sell a 13 year old girl in Ukraine. From what I've seen, the BBC and other news sources attribute this trafficking to the illegal organ selling market. Could that just be an attempt to cover up the real reason for the trafficking or am I just grasping at straws? The teacher tried to sell the girl for $10,000. Could the buyers actually be selling children in to sexual slavery as opposed to organ trafficking? I would assume it would be more profitable on their end to sell the children for sexual acts. Let me know your thoughts on this. And once again, this is my first time posting again I really want to help with this investigation </p></p>
