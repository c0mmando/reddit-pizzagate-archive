    I think people are getting to distracted in here about the twitter accounts when this sub is supposed to focus on pizzagate, there is a subreddit called r/twittergate it seems pretty dead but would it not be best to move operations to there so neither investigations are hindered?

    Exactly. Then people will see that some work for disney and start investigating them saying its a pedo company etc, which will translate into 5 threads popping up about bullshit imagery in disney movies. This is exactly how we get distracted from the main cause.

     Agreed, keep dialogue like this going.  It is important to realize that there is avalanche of information out there, but we need to find the most relevant, recent cases to sway public opinion that this is a
     <em>
      real and current
     </em>
     issue

      We still need a sticked thread at the top, kinda like what r/the_donald had before it was deleted (go figure ) Of all CONFIRMED evidence we have so far. Ive been saying this for weeks. 2 main threads
     </p>
     <p>
      1-Main thread for all confirmed evidence, a summary
     </p>
     <p>
      2-for all new evidence, if the NEW evidence turns out to be legit it gets posted into the MAIN thread
     </p>
     <p>
      We are getting no where when it comes to organization and planning. And now that this sub has broke 20000, its going to get that much harder wading through all the bullshit.

       yes, suspicious that one might use a throwaway.  Look at the post history before you concern troll and post bullshit replies like this, please.

    All the comments here are suspicious as hell; just check the users. 1 has one post, 1 has his last post 4 years ago and then just now (sold account?), 1 doesnt make sense in any way with the topics where he posted.

      Ever heard of a throwaway? It's not like I'm discouraging looking into the twitter accounts I'm trying to make it easier for people to differentiate between pizzagate and twittergate so this sub isn't swarmed from both sides

    No it wouldnt. This sub is getting traction and it would be so unfair to the people who risked their lives regarding the twitter leak, to deem them to discuss such a big event in an empty chatroom.
   </p>
   <p>
    This needs as much eyes on it as possible and this is a good place to start

     It wouldn't be empty if they were chatting in it would it? If I was a shill I'd be spamming this sub with twitter stuff.

    I agree. In fact i feel like this is coming to light for the express purpose of derailment. Pedos are crap whoever they are but we're not here to clean up every last aqualung. High profile, people. Target the big guys.

     Real law enforcement is gonna deal with the higher ups... Our job is to  put the fear of God into all the little guys... Thats what the FBI needs our help with... corralling all the cockroaches.

      I have my real doubts that law enforcement is going to go after the big guys unless public involvement and outcry is too much to keep quiet. To loosely paraphrase someone's analogy elsewhere - you don't stop your town's meth problem by going after the little users. You stop it by going after the ring leaders.

       They got the big ones on lockdown... the more little guys we can scare at this point... the more children we can save... we don't need conclusive proof... we just need to use fear to make them stop.

        Comet might be out of the kiddie business, however Hillary might have molested 10 kids since pizzagate was a thing. How do we know the FBI is actually doing anything if they have leadership complicit in the nasty stuff?

         The FBI is white-knight guns blazing against all the people in the justice system that used to cover-up this kind of stuff. Their image has been tarnished in the past, by my analysis of the current situation shows that they are going on a no-holds barred takedown of everyone complicit in this. Don't believe the soundbites you see on TV. Do some homework and see that the FBI has been draining that swamp for a good long while. HRC, Weiner, Podesta, Huma, Lynch, Wasserman... they are either under arrest or in protective custody now. The heads of the hydra are lopped off... It is our job to stomp on all the cockroaches that are scattering now that someone turned on the lights.

          They're arrested? Where does the information come from that they're in some manner of custody?

     Ted gunderson's website has reports which link to mk ultra etc, so there may be a legit link between it all. I personally believe it, I was into the illuminati a few years ago and read up alot.

       Swallow the whole redpill... you will understand how deeply entrenched this is... if you think it is just one pizza place to blame for hundreds of thousands of missing children then you are delusional.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't just take a nibble of the pill and expect to get any real work done.

             I can understand your frustration when you see your whole world collapsing around you... but you are polishing the brass on the titanic... Get in a lifeboat and start paddling... or go down with the ship.

    I think this whole twittergate is an attempt to derail the investigation. First of all those posts are devoid of shills which is really weird to me.
   </p>
   <p>
    Second it leads into a dead end investigation of exposing LOW LEVEL pedos and a pointless fight with Twitter.
   </p>
   <p>
    Third the gamer girl leaking shit is saying in her ama that the "occult" stuff and conspiracies is hurting the movement.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you look into this stuff you will see clearly that it all leads to occult, satanic pedophile rings and that its GLOBAL going on, on a very high level in all levels of authority.

     It is tangentially related because they are simultaneously sensoring #pizzagate, but I agree it is odd that people on this sub are dumb enough to link a page that would take people directly to a felony
