    circumstancial evidence from other cases - a curated bookmark list

    Please post here links to sites and videos that provide additional evidence.

    We are dealing here with human behaviour that hopefully is very foreign to all of us here, which also makes it sometimes to believe and hard to give sufficient weight to the evidence in front of us. I am talking of:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     the kidnapping, sexual abuse, torture and traumatizing of children
    </li>
    <li>
     murdering children in the most horrendous way, production of snuff movies that sell for a lot of money
    </li>
    <li>
     despite the hard evidence, it never results in prosecution. Police investigations derail, witnesses intimidated or die mysteriously, etc
    </li>
    <li>
     intelligence agencies and very powerful &amp; wealthy people are involved
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    In the last decades a lot of similar cases as PizzaGate are exposed and documented. It proves that we're dealing here with a global subculture that is not a recent incidental phenomenon. Let's compile here circumstantial evidence.

    Please provide a short description for links to videos and web pages.
