<strong>This is what happens to the children [NSFL]</strong>
<p><p>Background article on mind control and ritual abuse <a href="http://archive.is/aQYoo">here</a> - read it. </p>
<p>Saatchi has <a href="http://archive.is/7j0KH">these</a> paintings for sale by this poor woman. They're an MK-ULTRA manual for ritual abuse in all but name. International art dealer connected to pics of child abuse? Say it ain't so! Sorry - I'm struggling to type from rage.</p>

<p><p>Dear god. </p>
<p>This paintings... sweet Jesus. I'm at a loss for words. Those are absolutely despicable. </p>
<p>Some questions - what are the lighting bolts coming g out of the adults hands? Why are the children primary colors (mainly) while the adults tend to be secondary colors? </p>

<p><p>The lightning bolts are probably cattle prods or tasers.</p>

<p>You have to experience Monarch programming. It's a form of ritual abuse done at a very young age to force your mind to fracture. Look at how many times the victims experience a "floating away" in these paintings. That's the point. This woman has multiple personalities because of her horrifying experiences. </p></p>

<p><p>If it gives you any comfort, rest assured that there's a new game in town. The President Elect is well aware of these crimes against humanity by the global elite. You just have to listen to his speech at the Al Smith dinner where he told Hillary that he knew she took entire villages in Haiti. They will all be burned at the stake, hopefully literally and hopefully in public as the most severe warning to the world that this this sort of behavior will be met with the most extreme retribution.</p></p>

<p><p>NO - this photo of <a href="https://i.sli.mg/kHXqhi.jpg">someone comparing Kim's art</a> to flyer/poster for a show at Comet depicting a transparent body floating above a woman was being circulated early in the investigation .....it was just to show the similarities - it was wrongfullly assumed that Comet had Kim nobles art on their walls for a short time over that picture....no proof of that tho</p></p>

<p><p>I think the wand is the same as described by victims of alien abduction  used to control humans....a possible MKUltra device?  </p>
<p>the movie Communion (based on a book and real life account of abduction) shows aliens using one: </p>

<p><p>yes we have seen many correlations to Kim Nobles art and the Art in Tony Podestas collection and Comet ....this one looks to me like what could be described as "ping pong":</p>
<p>http://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/347bd017d211041208587.jpg</p>
<p>there is also a STRONG similarity to the way the children were hung from ropes </p>
<p>....this is by the artist Biljana Djurdjevic, of whom Tony Podesta has in his living room (to shock people) and his personal collection:</p>
<p>http://www.biljanadjurdjevic.com/images/LivingInOblivion/4Dummies.jpg</p>
<p>this is Kim Nobles art that depicts the SAME bondage:</p>

<p><p>You'll notice the teddy bear in some of the paintings.  Particularly in "What Ted Saw".  Teddy bears are an important tool in Monarch programming.  They are given the teddy bears by their handlers and help them to develop an emotional attachment to them.  Once the victim is sufficiently attached the handllers then exploit this relationship.  Depriving the victim of the bear, and as in the case depicted by Ria in "Ted's Legless" tearing the bear up while being held down. </p>
<p>The artists "real" name is Kim Noble. A Monarch survivor. 13 alter personalities.  All 13 paint in different styles.  Not all as disturbing as these. </p></p>

<p><p>i've been browsing this shit because I like conspiracies. Hell, I've been a long time peruser of this shit. 89% of internet conspiracies are bullshit but that never stopped me having a look anyway. </p>
<p>I feel like the first time I ever watched a conspiracy theory documentary (that was legit), sick to my stomach. But this is different, I'm holding back the vomit.</p>
<p>There is an old British video that was posted here a while ago about a girl who was a survivor of this shit back in the 80s or 90s, she describes what is going on in the photos. </p>

<p>There is also talk about the 'sludge' in buckets from other pictures that you can find on here. I dismissed them as an empty bucket, but now I can see clearer.</p>
<p>I want to believe that the artist is so fucked up that she drew inspiration from those videos, but it wasn't like that interview was exactly common knowledge.</p>
<p>The disassociated bodies are the worst. I'm not religious, I'm not atheist but I'm coming around to the thinking that the damage that these fucks want to inflict is not just mental, physical and emotional but it is spiritual. </p>
<p>They want to fuck with the basis of life, with consciousness itself. If the idea of the 'holographic universe' is true, the damage they do here, damages the whole.</p>
<p>And I'll end this on a complete fucking /rant</p>
<p>You fucks are not the only one that knows how this game works. </p>
<p>You have forced some of us into ourselves, and as terrified as we were we realized something. We realized we have the same power as you do, but it doesn't require the physical, mental or emotional brute force as you have used.</p>
<p>Mind creates reality, and the reality of your future is that you will be brought out into public view. Once that is done, the normies will do the rest.</p>
<p>You cannot escape from this, either in this world or the next, and you are losing control right the fuck now. Look at recent events, why have attempts to forge towards your version reality failed? Is it perhaps there are new players to the game?</p>
<p>Return to source and redo, it's your only hope, you have made a grave mistake.</p>

<p><p>Yeah I was originally thinking that, spirit cooking spooked me back into being a practicing Christian, I pray every day for our nation, and for God to protect Trump. When we do get our hands on these witches and their men-in-the-middle, we should burn them at the stake in a public execution.</p></p>

<p><p>At first, I didn't pay much attention to it though, thought it was some kind of a sheet or a towel, but then I read this from <a href="https://dcpizzagate.wordpress.com/">dcpizzagate.wordpress.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is interesting to look at Kim Noble’s art, who is known for suffering Satanic Ritual Abuse and her personality has permanently splintered into different entities. In this painting, you can see five adults standing in what looks to be a pentagram. Below the child being raped, there is a handkerchief and this appears in multiple of Kim’s paintings. Apparently the handkerchiefs are put under the child to collect blood/semen as a token or “map”. Hmm, where else have we heard about a handkerchief recently?</p>

<p><p>Not literal foil on head mind control. But brainwashing.  Religious cults like Mormons. Jws and scientology do it all the time </p></p>
