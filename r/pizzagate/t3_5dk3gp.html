<strong>The guy, Frank Winstead, that recorded Comic Ping Pong Pizza under suspicion in 2007 also came out publicly against the owner, James Alefantis, claiming "rape" and "murder" (audio file inside)</strong>
<p><p>First off, I'd like to give credit to the original article from 6/18/2008 <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/rawfisher/2008/06/dc_official_outdoor_seats_at_p.html">here</a>.  </p>
<p>On May 26, 2007, Frank Winstead, recorded a video of Comic Ping Pong citing that the outdoor ping pong tables were unsafe, and I wholeheartedly agree.  That video can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHXBrEXmowo">here</a>.  <em>Note</em>, there are some accusations in the comments that "help me, help me" can be heard audibly.  While our brain is telling us that a child is screaming "help me", I'm not exactly sure it's actually plausible, but I am not dismissing it.  </p>
<p>More importantly, and per the topic title, I encourage as many people as possible to download the audio of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3F Monday night meeting from back in 2008.  In <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mitalgandhi/anc3fmeeting">this audio</a> (taken from the above, first link in the subject) is an audio taping of that night.  I skimmed the three-part audio, but here's what I found.  </p>
<p><strong>In part 2:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Part 2 opens with Mital M Gandhi (some sort of chairmen of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission) talking about his interactions with James Alefantis, and how he met with him and supports his proposal to expand the Pizza Shop, and to have LIVE MUSIC.  And to be allowed to extend weekend hours from midnight to 2 (or3) AM.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>18:00ish of the part2 clip, some woman attacks James for not being honest in the past with the transparency of his business operations.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>27:30ish someone (I believe this is Frank now) goes on to say that James brought his buddies "here" for the vote.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>28:30: Frank: "Face it, James is trying to turn this into Adam's Morgan with the murders and the rapes".  The jeering crowd drowns him out.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's where I stopped.  Feel free to pick up.  But I do feel this should be submitted to the pool of evidence.  Thank you.</p></p>

<p><p>I think he was referring to late night businesses attracting seedy people with the "rape and murders" comment.  Although I could be wrong.</p>
<p>Whats Frank up to these days?  Has anyone tried contacting him?</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah he was.  But he was on a mission.  He smelled something really foul here.  9 years later it turns out he's right.</p></p>

<p><p>Come at us bro. Target the thousands of people, that is already realizing. Target to generate more stories for more audience. The cats out the box you know. Comes time comes judgment. I want you to remember how the Tzar family once thought they were all powerful too. </p></p>
