    Never in my 67 years on this earth did I expect to see that the USA I love was run by a secret cabal of pedophile satanic murderers. No wonder progress towards peace is never attained.
   </p>
   <p>
    It's really quite scary.
   </p>
   <p>
    You guys/girls are doing a wonderful job rooting out this evil.
   </p>
   <p>
    What is the next step ?
   </p>
   <p>
    As it looks, no help is coming from law enforcement as they seem entrenched in the scandal themselves. That friendship bracelet that Biden gave Obama with a slice of pizza charm on it, sealed the deal for me.

    It also looks like both Clinton and Trump are connected via Epstein.

    What an exciting time to be alive.

    God bless you all, keep up the good work.

    Not sure sure on Trump.  They have been trying to smear him hard on this but every attempt has failed it seems.  Yes he knows the guy but so does everyone who is anybody.  The guy is a billionaire philanthropist. 
Perhaps Trump is dirty too, but I'm holding out hope he isn't.
Things the FBI has leaked, and the appointments Trump has made seem to hint that he's going to go after this corruption.  Once January 20th is here we will know.

     I hope that Trump will help bring these people down. However, I think it's possible that the reason the issue was never brought forth by the left/media is that investigating Trump on this subject would've led to uncovering everyone else's crimes, too. A "mutually assured destruction" type of situation. I don't think we can entirely rule him out just because it never came up during the election.

      The reason this woman keeps dropping the lawsuit is because she keeps getting death threats.

       I assume there has to be some kind of bribe or threat. If it was a false claim intended as defamation, they wouldn't bring up the same case multiple times.

       I find some of his statements from
       <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2016/10/08/politics/trump-on-howard-stern/index.html">
        this Howard Stern interview
       </a>
       particularly unsettling. Namely, his descriptions of his daughter, and barging in on naked pageant contestants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, he encouraged his daughter to go into modeling, even though he knew the industry was full of managers preying on young women.

    We will know about Trump once he is in office. If he takes no action, then surely he is implicated. Either way, we must push on until then.

    i think your pizza charm assumption was made by your confirmation bias.  my tutor in middle school had a pizza watch, but to my knowledge she was not involved in sex slavery rings.  let's look critically.  other than the blatant pizza imagery, what relations do obama and biden have to the occult pedophile rings?
