<p><p>There's a newer version of that email as well: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46045</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is he really that long serving? described as long serving aide at the foundation</p>
<p>No could be doug or ira.</p>
<p>?Whoever it is -he/she is being a tad unhelpful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something is up with Eric Braveman though, so could be him. No tweets from him lately: https://twitter.com/eric_braverman/with_replies 
 and couldn't find anything about him lately, besides the rumors that you linked. </p></p>

<p><p>The second link in the OP has comments, one of them says he's been missing a month and then the same person posts again saying they found him, 
http://www.arenastage.org/about/board-of-trustees/
His name is on the left in the list. Although not way to tell how up to date that website is.</p></p>
