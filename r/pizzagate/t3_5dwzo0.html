        <p><p>Believe me, these techniques aren't used to influence people solely on internet forums. These techniques and the likes can be seen easily on a plethora of types of media and, frankly, across pretty much all mediums through which information travels.</p>
<p>If you're going to get in to the information world, understanding psychology and group theory is almost necessary if you want to be an effective contributor in the sector.</p></p>

        <p><p>That is not all. I've observed the techniques used by Russian trolls (against me as well), and the simplest  are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Positive posts: there with be a flood of posts presenting the people in question in positive light. The events portrayed are true. In Russian troll context: they simply posted images of the most beautiful Russian churches. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Involvement and dilution: involve the most vocal posters in a conversation to keep them busy. When running out if arguments, drop the thread. Option: put the sanity if the interlocutor in doubt, which is easy given the crazy topic - "are you insane thinking that this politician is a paedophile?"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep your eyes on the topic, and don't forget that trolls aren't green, they are normal, intelligent people. I've spotted a few already. </p></p>

        <p><p>Very interesting... I knew a user was trying to troll me into revealing information about myself quite a while before the election... we went back and forth for like 100 posts and they repeatedly led the conversation to various subjects, which in hindsight was digging for blackmail info. They only stopped when I told them that I have never done anything in my whole life that I would be ashamed of... although I called them a pedo several times I thought it was odd they never denied it... only tried me to admit that I was a pedo. It was on a non-political sub... and all of their other posts were on a knife/weapon sub, part of the techniques mentioned above. </p>
<p>Also... over a year ago I chatted on reddit with someone who was obviously acting sketchy... They were looking for forum moderators from websites for a "radio documentary" - I'd have to guess this was an early attempt to root out good targets to subvert. </p>

        <p><p>Considering that a combination of tactic #2 &amp; #3 was just used rather successfully by u/iHaveDamningEvidence's submission in this subreddit before the mods deleted the thread with the added bonus of trying to get members to download CP, the mods should sticky this subject for an extended period of time to bring more awareness to these strategies.</p>
<p>Better yet, repost with better formatting and sticky that.</p></p>
