    Don't let the twitter incident distract you from PizzaGate
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    They are two separate things.
   </p>
   <p>
    Different players.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     One involves high level politicians, pedophilia, child rape, human trafficking, ritual sacrifice, satanism, power consolidation among governments ruled by pedophiles, murderers and child rapists.
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    The other involves low level pedophiles posting pedo pics to twitter.
   </p>
   <p>
    Take it to another sub and keep going on getting the word out about PizzaGate.
   </p>
   <p>
    While both are horrible, PizzaGate is more important and relevant to this sub.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mods need to take care of this and point people to /r/TwitterGate
   </p>
   <p>
    Notice almost all top posts are now talking about Twitter instead of the sham that is world government's addiction to pedophilia, child rape, spending tax payers money on pedophilia, ritual sacrifice and cannibalism.

    Giving how that guy said he had geographical locations of the twitter followers it might be good to check the ones in DC and try connecting them with people suspected here.

     Pizzagate and twittergate are 100% related. Remember fbianon told us the Saudis pay the Clintons with money and children. A Saudi Prince is the majority shareholder of Twitter.

      they are NOT, this whole TG nonsense is simply a mix of homo's with some pedo's. mostly from countries like thailand and japan. Most are selfies of just underaged kids NOT forced. PG is about brutal forced pedophilia. I'm from jp, and you don't ever hear of brutal pedophilia here

       I agree. I am feeling more and more as if the whole TG deal was handed to us so we can feel like we "achieved our goal" of persecuting paedos.

       Notice that almost a full day later the front page is nothing but TG posts (and the mods allow this)

       Forced or not forced there is NO difference. It is rape. Plain and simple. A child cannot consent even if they said the word yes. It doesn't fucking matter. One is brutal and horrifying but the other is as well because even if a child is smiling and seems to be complicit, don't forget they have been groomed and conditioned to accept it as normal. It is just as fucked up. Please don't try and justify or separate them. It's child rape.

        NO. here is where you're entirely wrong. In these countries they are not "groomed". Pedophilia is entirely different in japan as it is in the u.s. Most pedophilia content in japan is loose kids posting nude selfies and people obsessed in moe culture just circulate it much less even act on it. even the yakuza do not endorse such behavior and are against it.
       </p>
       <p>
        The outstanding issue in japan is not pedophilia but rape/bully amongst minors in school

         Sorry I missed the selfie bit! I am wrong on that part. 14-15 yr old sending nudes to each other is totally different to child abuse. My bad.

    You have felony conviction worthy evidence on 30,000 pedophiles vs. circumstantial evidence that has all the hallmarks of a 30 or 40 person pedophilia ring, but nothing convictable right now. And you think the later is more important? Are you out of your mind?
   </p>
   <p>
    30,000 vs. 30 to 40 scumbags.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clearly this is not about the kids for you. You just want your pound of liberal flesh. I admit the later would be an admiral goal in most situations, but not now.

      Taking down the low level guys should hopefully result in some good connections.  Let's face it, this whole "industry" is a giant web.  There are not exactly a bunch of competing "providers" out there for this material.  Just need to trace it all, and the money exchanged to reveal the rats at the top.  BOTH the high and low levels need to be investigated.

       Take them down? How?

       What people don't realize is, the entire government is involved. All the agencies meant to protect the kids are involved.

       Nobody is coming to help and the only way this will be sorted out is by a public lynch mob and a people revolution.

        What you are saying is that every agent in all the agencies and every powerful politician is involved.  Nonsense.  That's what they want you to believe to instill a sense of hopelessness.  A public lynch mob is never ever going to happen so you can forget it.
Let's use logic.
There are definitely people in positions of power who work to cover this up.  They have held all the cards up until recently.  Given the extent of the corruption, there therefore must be "good guys" with in government who know about this but have been silenced through various means. By bringing attention to all of this and exposing things, we can enable the good guys to wage a more effective war on the ones who have been covering this up.  There are definitely internal factions in play.  Not saying the good guys will win, but it's definitely not "everyone in government" doing this.  Probably just the few who control things at the very top, and their henchmen at lower levels.

         They are all involved. Your kidding yourself if you think otherwise.

          Who is "they" and what do you mean by "all"?  It's ridiculous.  The folks at the top are the ones in control.  Every journalist at the NYT is not "in on this" (just to take one of the most biased examples).  Your attitude breeds a sense of hopelessness and is not constructive.  Makes me wonder.

            The more likely scenario with Twitter specifically, is they are concerned over taking a hit on stock prices so are trying to snuff out the flames ASAP.  Sure some folks at Twitter are probably "in it" but the thing with conspiracies is that they are hard to keep secret if more people know.  Occam's razor says probably only the few powerful in control know about what's really going on.
But yeah - stock price

        I agree. And focus on the big guys. The once selling kids, not the once that abuse their children at home. We will take them next.

      Do you think taking down John &amp; Tony Podesta and some democratic fundraisers is going to get the country back from Soros, Bloomberg, Zuckerman, and the rest of the establishment?

     Umm.. Its not twitter who posted the links. Its users on twitter.

     To blame twitter for this is ridiculous.

     They can't monitor millions of accounts without them being reported first.

       Mark is No better. Maybe a bit, havent seen any of that horror I saw on Twitter last night But a LOT of accounts for meeting friends with same interest. Dont take them down either, even when you report kids pic. Over the line.

     Different players.
    </p>
    <p>
     One involves high level politicians, pedophilia, ritual sacrifice, satanism.
    </p>
    <p>
     The other involves low level pedophiles posting pedo pics to twitter.

       There aren't always dots to connect, and weak, false, or tenuous connections are the reason why nobody is taking pizzagate seriously. There's no reason why low-level pedophiles networking on twitter would have anything to do with a small, tight-knit ring of elites who are smart and well-connected enough not to broadcast their child love on fucking twitter of all places. There are pedo networks all over the internet if you know where to look for them. They aren't part of some grand elite conspiracy, there just happens to be a lot of sick fucks in the world who are into pedophilia and people in 3rd-world countries and the dredges of Western society who are willing and able to meet their demands.

There aren't always dots to connect, and weak, false, or tenuous connections are the reason why nobody is taking pizzagate seriously. There's no reason why low-level pedophiles networking on twitter would have anything to do with a small, tight-knit ring of elites who are smart and well-connected enough not to broadcast their child love on fucking twitter of all places. There are pedo networks all over the internet if you know where to look for them. They aren't part of some grand elite conspiracy, there just happens to be a lot of sick fucks in the world who are into pedophilia and people in 3rd-world countries and the dredges of Western society who are willing and able to meet their demands."

    I am wondering if the outbreak/timing of this is due to the world's governments desire to shift attention off of them, to make many users "inadvertently" look at CP so they have a reason to deflect, or if it's simply that Pizzagate is blowing up and people are more aware and looking out for this stuff now. Hard to tell.

    Thank you. This could be a ruse to entrap lower level pedo's and deflect attention from the higher ups. Focus on pizzagate!

    This is a proof of concept though, if it's possible to easily convict these sickos on Twitter, then we can prove they are attempting to cover something up with pizzagate.

    Posts like this are dangerous. You're implying there is no variable that relates them but there is: CP and child abuse. They could be related for all we know do for you to make that judgment call is wrong

    Yes exactly I agree. Good post! A journalist was looking info on 0hour on this pizzagate section. Surely theres a Twittergate one they should of went too instead (not that I have looked as yet) although its interesting too but I came to reddit on a Madeleine Mcann Pizzagate link and have been here since. I have been searching and reading for years, everyday about the case and then the Podestas pop up recently and the clement freud connection and its all linking together nicely. Thank you Pizzagate. Lets get Madeleine found one way or another and lets get these low lifes exposed for all other crimes too.

    We may be able to prove the pizzagate bastards are all tied up in twitter gate. Would not be surprised if they were in the master file somewhere - or could be proved to be tied to jack &amp; twitter being so pedo friendly. He is so tight with the clinton foundation even in Haiti it's ridiculous.

    So twitter aren't to blame because 'how can they monitor millions of accounts?' Well some fucking random geek used a simple script to identify tens of thousands in a day or two. They can do it.

     They are not you are correct.  But they must also be hunted down and prosecuted.  It's possible to do both.  They are not mutually exclusive tasks.

    Twitter has cp. Get over it. REport it! but move the fuck on. That doesnt mean dont investigate possible connections.
   </p>
   <p>
    EDIT: All im saying is.. this is old news. yes report it, spam all people who are connected, Dig deeper! But Like most of us we are waiting for more info from autists.

     Stop trying to marginalize the depth of this - it is not old news, IT JUST HAPPENED ~12 HOURS AGO. Don't wait for more info from autists - you get to digging too and find info. That's how we will all overcome this crime that is plaguing the world.
