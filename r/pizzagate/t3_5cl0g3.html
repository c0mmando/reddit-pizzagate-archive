        <p><p>I've seen people say it's supposed to be based on the position that a victim of Jeffrey Dahmer was left in, but the Canadian National Gallery seems to disagree with that being a source of inspiration. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artwork.php?mkey=100798">"Stemming from her interest in the physical, emotional, and psychological aspects of pain and fear, Bourgeois was drawn to the arch of hysteria as theorized and represented by the nineteenth-century neurologist Jean Martin Charcot (1825-1893). While working at the Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, Charcot sought to represent hysteria by documenting the performances of his female patients. The physical tension of the hysterical arch - an intense muscular contraction, resulting in immobility and paralysis of the limbs - is emblematic of an equally extreme emotional state. Bourgeois makes this highly vulnerable position even more so by suspending her male figure from the ceiling. In choosing to represent him in an attitude traditionally associated with the female, the artist transgresses the social and sexual roles assigned to women, challenging the misconception of hysteria as a female malady."</a></p></p>

<p>We as a "conspiracy" community should know this better than anyone. We shouldn't just automatically accept it just because it happens to line up with our views this time. </p>

        <p><p>Note the #faggot hashtag where she's holding sticks.</p>
<hr>
<p>Thought experiment for historical context: "Faggot" was originally a slur for Fascists, who used child rape and torture in Roman times as their command and control structure.</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5ca797/thought_experiment_for_historical_context_faggot/</p>
<p>(Note: There is much speculation involved here, but it appears to ring true.)</p>
<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2lrdqa/til_the_words_fascist_and_faggot_both_derive_from/">Both "faggot" and "fascist" derive from the Latin root Fasces.</a> Faggot refers to the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fasces&amp;safe=off&amp;biw=1212&amp;bih=553&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch">bundle of sticks used as a symbol of fascism</a>. When people realized the child abuse inherent in the system, it became a slur for the fascists themselves.</p>
<p>Child rape was no more acceptable in ancient Rome than it is now. This was not a normal relationship in another culture, as it's presented today. When the fascists were caught raping children, they were burned. Stories of these executions have been replaced by stories of burning non-pedophile homosexuals in order to demonize the practice and bury the past.</p>
<p>Similarly, the term "faggot" has since been linguistically morphed into a pejorative for non-pedophile homosexuals, in an effort to obfuscate <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/12/20/very-very-bad-things/">the satanic command/control structure of child rape and torture</a> that's still in place by the global fascists today.</p>
<p>Fascists are hiding behind homosexuals just as Khazarians hide behind the Jews, using them as human shields to absorb blame and deflect suspicion and as political tools where useful.</p>
<p>One last thought... People in a victim mindset, those who have endured trauma, are easy to manipulate. MKULTRA writ large.</p>

        <p><p>I've had that sick feeling in my gut for weeks, and I know no one will believe me.  Who will speak out for the victims, someone with credentials has to, otherwise it will just fall into the pit of conspiracy theories.  But I've seen things proven in the last month that I never thought I'd see.  Someone has to speak.</p></p>

        <p><p>remember the email talking about the Luzzatto kids and something about a farm in Lovvettsville? I Google map searched that city, there's only one named that in VA. Looked at farms, quarter branch farm had this place called fazenda Burity right next to it. You click on it the link and it brings you to a site in Brazil. Google map says it's a farm but the pictures make it look like a resort or commune of some type. Seems shady. Anyone else wanna confirm this is suspicious?</p></p>

Note that it's not explicitly sexual, but for some reason there are young butts like <a href="http://66.media.tumblr.com/1beff105494d2eef85808d18428017d7/tumblr_nubdjwlDqM1qisyv1o1_500.jpg">this</a> and <a href="http://65.media.tumblr.com/b3c7b17cd984e2ba436d3907b1be3ae4/tumblr_nekugsfLCO1qisyv1o1_500.png">this</a> in there.

<p>One person cannot do this alone. With the internet growing and helping us communicating better, we can expose them one by one, and then collectively people will start to be more informed and expose them more.</p></p>

        <p><p>I have a feeling that whenever we discover some kind of possible clue like this, it most likely will turn out to be true. Throughout all of the compilations of evidence and connections, the one thing that has been overwhelmingly present, is their overconfidence in NOT hiding the obvious clues. They probably get off on that fact in some aspect. Knowing they're out in the open, but completely hidden.</p></p>

        <p><p>FWIW they mention the CF only working in countries where kids don't get birth certificates but this is at least partially incorrect. A friend I played AAU ball with was born in Haiti and Ive seen his birth certificate. No clue about the other countries they work in though.</p></p>

        <p><p>There's also this email mentioning the Luzzatto's. Sick. </p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/47943</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had a Luzzattopalooza yesterday, with Marisa-Paul-10 month Evie staying 
with us already while their house gets painted, and Ben-Alex sledding their 
3 over to "help" us decorate the tree. When the parents got back to 
retrieve children, they threw in the towel (and about 19 pieces of winter 
clothing) to stay for tortellini and an overnight. So, 6 grownups with 2 
toddlers and 2 infants spread throughout the house, and sure enough one of those 
toddlers was rubbing my nose at 5:45..........</p>

        <p><p>He makes a lot of quick leaps without explaining himself.</p>
<p>Like, fuck it, Mo means Molestor? Why not Mordor? or Mordred? or Motion? Mobile? Motivated? Motivating? Why not! No research into the person, no contextualizing, just 'yep im on the trail and all my leads are hot and all my ideas are obviously right'.</p></p>

        <p><p>I absolutely can attest that "Mo" is current American lexicon for Child Molesters. I am not saying that is WHAT that screen name means, however you are being VERY closed minded about what the name, plus context, could mean.</p>
<p>If you researched those IG accounts half as long as you have rebuked my submission, you may have found something... but telling me my leads are shit seems MUCH more productive.</p>
<p>LOL its cool. This is my new hobby.</p></p>

        <p><p>Ether you are a professional in the child molesting scene or you know something i dont. "Mo" is used for "My/Me" in english, and not really that rare ether. There is not a single entry for Mo in urban dictionary ether that comes even close to your biased conclusion.</p>
<p>Seriously just be careful who you call child molester. Assholes like you can destroy peoples lifes, you've seen how far this witchhunting train is willing to go, maybe this guy just likes to play ping pong at this place and put a comment on the wrong picture in the wrong moment. DO NOT JUST ACCUSE PEOPLE BASED ON NOTHING</p>
<p>Edit:// Btw as you have Pizza in your name (ignoring any rational facts) i will from now on assume your are a child molester too!</p></p>

        <p><p>That is very much conjecture. And makes everyone else heres hard work seem crazy because People will see what you wrote and say "Oh their just crazy schizos". One would almost think you're being paid to do so.</p></p>

        <p><p>I haven't even read your history. But yes, this very comment about "mochef" is something I really hope anyone coming here looking for serious answers doesn't see or focus on. "Oh they're just crazy and jump to wild conclusions, this is all probably conspiracy crap"</p></p>

<p>There is smoke. There is likely fire. You will not persuade me to quit asking for more evidence, you will not make me stop wanting people to show their work. Wild conjecture will be the death of this and I won't sit by and let this stuff slide unchecked.</p></p>

        <p><p>Were talking about pedo-rings operating out of pizza parlors, and possible cannibalism.</p>
<p>A name like MoChef103 seems congruent with this vane of reasoning.</p></p>
