<strong>Monica Petersen was not murdered for investigating Clinton. It's all a lie made up by someone who was specifically asked not to spread untruths about Monica..</strong>
<p><p>/u/rutkdn has been claiming for days now, that Bella, a friend of Monica Petersen corrobated his claims that Monica had been investigating Clinton in Haiti and that her death had been suspicious. </p>
<p>Here's a statement form Bella which she sent to me after I asked her on Facebook</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to help get Redditt to take down the thread and stop disrespecting Monica and her family.   Her death had nothing to do with a Clinton conspiracy and she wasn't even researching that.   The details of her death are not anyones business, this is private information that some jerk posted on Reddit after he was asked to keep it private.  Monica was researching sex trafficking which is when a person pimps out a minor for prostitution, and it has nothing to do with Clinton or pedophile rings.  These people have posted this crap all over redditt which is totally disrespecting the family. None of you people seem to have a clue what Monica research was about because you are so quick to jump on the trafficking narrative.  Here is a audio show that interviewed Monica a few months before her death.  Stop tagging Monica name into this shit.  It is all over online and is upsetting to her family, especially since its not true.  Episode 26: Fighting the Trafficking Narrative from </p>

<p>If you don't believe me then ASK HER YOURSELF. DO YOUR OWN INVESTIGATION BEFORE BLINDLY BELIEVING SOME ANONYMOUS GUY ON THE INTERNET.</p></p>

<p><p>Monica was investigating trafficking of children from Haiti.</p>
<p>She was investigating the Clinton Foundation AND DIDN'T KNOW IT.</p>
<p>That's the problem.</p>
<p>The family will want the truth - however terrible it is - to be revealed.</p></p>

<p><p>Firstly, if you want the slightest bit of credibility you should at least post a screenshot. </p>
<p>Secondly, the reason we heard about this case in the first place was because Bella made the FB comments herself.</p>
<p>I assume you haven't seen the uploaded video by the Center of Human Trafficking, where her boss made a statement about her either...</p></p>

<p>I've seen it. There is no proof that it was posted by Bella, written by Monica and it did not claim that Clinton were involved in child trafficking. </p>
<p>That's why I ask for proof.</p></p>

<p><p>I have now been contacted by 3 different people privately trying to convince me that there is no link to the foundation. This is really bad. Something is going on.</p>
<p>Monica was clearly investigating Clinton.</p>
<p>Bella can say what she wants now (if she did indeed say to you what you claim). It DOES NOT change the facts she posted 11 months ago.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Back in January 4th Bella shared Monica's findings: https://i.sli.mg/PsLtmj.png</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The day before, on January 3rd, she re-shared a post originally made by Monica with a link to a blog post critical of Hillary Clinton (second item here: http://i.imgur.com/TmiB2gU.png). <strong>"Ms. Clinton has corrupt &amp; dirty business to finish in Haiti ...  This is the theory my masters thesis puts forth"</strong> ----&lt; how do you not see what Monica was up to? Are you blind?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Also FYI, the family has NOT RECEIVED MONICA'S BODY. I repeat, they did not bury her and an autopsy was not done in the US. They are trusting misinformation coming out of Haiti.</strong></p>
<p>If anything, Bella must be very scared at this point. I tend to agree with that gut feeling.</p></p>

<p><p>Can somebody please explain to me how "sex trafficking" and "pimping out minors" for sex is NOT a pedophilia ring?  If you are "pimping out minors", that means you have clients; if you have clients, that means you have a network.  Thats the textbook definition of a pedophilia ring.  Is this guy fucking stupid or what?</p></p>

<p>The one is prostitution but with minors. </p>
<p>The other is an organized group which meets to rape &amp; kill children in pizza restaurants. At least according to this subreddit.</p></p>

<p><p>Your posting history is very interesting. Old account that has not been used in four years, revived only 5 days ago with the sole purpose of lying about Monica's death and discrediting what has been uncovered about the criminal Clinton Foundation and its ties to child trafficking. Classic CTR operation.</p>
<p>Just give it up. You have ZERO credibility. </p></p>

<p><p>Reminds me of this:</p>
<p>"The lady doth protest too much, methinks" is a quotation from the c. 1600 play Hamlet by William Shakespeare. </p>
<p>I think someone mentioned this a few days ago in relation to Sandy Hook.  </p>
<p>I would think that someone like Bella would know human trafficking and pedophilia go hand in hand.  I think if Monica Peterson was definitely in Haiti and died it IS tied to Clintons or human trafficking or something terrible and should be investigated. </p></p>

<p><p>I swear I've seen a (Facebook?) tirade by Monica Petersen that blasts the Clinton Foundation's involvement in Haiti. It also calls into question mineral rights granted to Hillary's brother. Anyone have this? Because it would directly refute the OP's claim that Monica wasn't <em>at least</em> very skeptical of the Clinton Foundation. Edit: Was it a public post? Edit2: It's still on 8chan /pol/</p></p>

<p><p>Wow. I have now been contacted by 3 different people privately trying to convince me that there is no link to the foundation. This is really bad. Something is going on.</p>
<p>I repeat, Monica was clearly investigating Clinton.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Back in January 4th Bella shared Monica's findings: https://i.sli.mg/PsLtmj.png</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The day before, on January 3rd, she re-shared a post originally made by Monica with a link to a blog post critical of Hillary Clinton (second item here: http://i.imgur.com/TmiB2gU.png). <strong>"Ms. Clinton has corrupt &amp; dirty business to finish in Haiti ...  This is the theory my masters thesis puts forth"</strong> ----&lt; how do you not see what Monica was up to? Are you blind?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Also FYI, the family has NOT RECEIVED MONICA'S BODY. I repeat, they did not bury her and an autopsy was not done in the US. They are trusting misinformation coming out of Haiti.</strong></p>
<p>If anything, Bella must be very scared at this point. I tend to agree with that gut feeling.</p></p>

<p><p>Please quote where I "claim that Monica wasn't at least very skeptical of the Clinton Foundation".</p>
<p>I never claimed that so please do not make up stuff that is not true. </p>
<p>In another post I specifically stated that yes, Monica was critical of Clinton. She wrote a whole article about Haiti and criticized Clinton's politics.</p>
<p>However, she never linked Clinton to child trafficking.</p>
<p>See the difference?</p></p>

<p><p>There is no need to be so defensive. My post isn't directed at you, since I highly doubt you'd be the one providing what I am seeking. I want to see the screen capture that was circulated last week not argue with someone who is grieving. Whoever-- you, or the person quoted--outright says this has nothing to do with the Clintons perhaps hasn't considered the totality of circumstances. </p></p>

<p><p>The title of your post says no Clinton involvement. I don't think that connection can be overlooked outright. Somehow you think that it's impossible for the "pimp-pimped" dynamic to exist in an organized, even international apparatus such as with the CF? Very hard to follow. </p>
<p>If I've misunderstood it's because you've miscommunicated or have been intentionally vague/misleading. </p></p>

<p><p>This is just like Seth Rich's parents in denial about why their son was killed. We know from wikileaks that Laura Silsby has a close relationship with the Clinton syndicate. It isn't a stretch by any means to say that someone who is researching human trafficking in Haiti is ultimately investigating the Clinton's operations there. Besides, how do her parents know what she was on to or what she was killed for? I think often in grief, including after what is perceived as a suicide, loved ones can become so emotional that they are unable to critically consider the full possibilities of the circumstances of a death. I.E. they think this was a run of the mill suicide.</p></p>

<p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>How does the guy who made the first thread about it know?</p>
<p>Why believe him when none of her friends and relatives support his claims?</p>
<p>He literally has no evidence at all for his claim. Monica never in any of her writings or statements connected the Clintons to child trafficking. His claim that her friends and family supported his claims turned out to be nothing but fabrications. </p>
<p>So why believe him? Just because something is theoretically possible does not mean it is a fact. </p></p>

<p>The one is prostitution but with minors.</p>
<p>The other is an organized group which meets to rape &amp; kill children &gt; in pizza restaurants. At least according to this subreddit.</p>
<p><em>I'm down in Haiti for the next 3 wks doing fieldwork on human trafficking (i.e. ALL exploited labor sectors, not just sex)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there is the statement from Bella.. If she didn't want people to mix the Clinton foundation in her death, why the fuck is she calling them out in her post about her death?</p>
<p>My main language is not english, so please someone tell me if i'm retarded and understanding this incorrectly or if OP is a CTR cumswapper that made a fake fb account and messaged himself.</p></p>
