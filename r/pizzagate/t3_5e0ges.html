        <strong>A potential idea to disseminate Information to the Masses</strong>
        <p><p>So look, one issue that I think we are faced with sometimes is "getting the word out" about things effectively and having it spread easily.</p>
<p>And then this just dawned on me: perhaps the "cyber hacking" organization, Anonymous has unintentionally gifted us with a means to spread info relatively discreetly, and have a good shot at still going viral.</p>
<p>I notice people impersonate Anonymous and release 'unofficial' videos from time to time - but why is this such a bad thing? (assuming the information is true; you should always provide evidence for the claims so we aren't crying wolf).</p>
<p>The spirit of Anonymous is a means to spread the truth, regardless of where it comes from.  Ideas are power.  When people see that Guy Fawkes mask, people tend to listen a bit more intently.</p>
<p>Whether you choose to rip one of their videos and then replace the speech with your own "morphed" speech, or if you put a mask on yourself, the whole Anonymous thing could be used as a weapon to fight back, and to even plug more people into this forum/movement.  And the best part is, Anonymous will get the credit (assuming we use the tool responsibly unlike how some other people have).  Red pill</p>
<p>Just a thought~</p></p>

        <p><p>I'm sorry, but most of the people I know who see the mask just wind up laughing at it. The idea is there, but the execution must be different for people to take it as seriously as they should.</p></p>

        <p><p>The typical anonymous execution is to make a threat about something that they are going to do.  But the tool should be used AFTER you have already acquired the information.</p>
<p>And i agree - not many people take it seriously (even I don't); but people still continue to look and share.  They may laugh, but it STILL catches their curiosity. </p></p>

        <p><p>Recently, I have seen too much BS associated with the anonymous tag. I'd probably think it's some edgy teen trying to have his 5 minutes of glory on internet if it were to happen.</p></p>

        <p><p>I already posted in there - I volunteered to handle all of the audio production and assist in the assembly of the transcript.  I havent gotten any notifications in a few hours though - maybe im missing something</p></p>

        <p><p>I hope something comes of it. I don't think the anonymous idea is a bad one. There are definitely a large number of people who do take notice of 'the mask'. Besides, as many avenues to the truth as there can be, the better.</p></p>
