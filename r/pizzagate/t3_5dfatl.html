        <p><p>Found this after reading about Eyes Wide Shut - Venetian masks used in sex parties are known as domino masks.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is what Podesta meant in that one email...</p></p>

        <p><p>Also Domino was the name of a prostitute Bill met in Eyes Wide Shut, who had those masks on her wall.</p></p>

        <p><p>There's that picture from Alefantis' IG of the three people in these masks too.</p></p>

        <p><p>This is certainly an interesting bit I hadn't heard of yet. The question then is, would it be appropriate for someone to say 'playing dominoes' in reference to wearing the mask? They may just speak in loose terms, expecting the receiving party to interpret the correct meaning as well.</p></p>

        <p><p>I knew what it meant only because the Domino Mask is one of the rarest items in <a href="http://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Dark-Souls-2/Black%20Witch%20Domino.jpg">Dark Souls 2</a>. it has no relation, but it is a rather strange item in the game since it has a unique feature no other armor piece shares.. In the game you have armor sets, usually 4 items in a set (arms, legs, chest, helm). Some rare one-of armor like unique helms or chests, but the Black Witch set has 2 additional helmets that are dropped by NPC invaders (5% chance) in NG+. It's the only armor set with 3 helms (black witch hat, veil
 and domino mask). The weird part is that the NPC that drops the mask isn't even wearing it, which is an event that never happens. Something is unique about this mask in the game.</p></p>
