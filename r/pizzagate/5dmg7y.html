    Was this just aired?  If so, its most definitely due to the renewed attention due to the Podesta bros theory.
   </p>
   <p>
    A bungled burglary?  So the girl wakes up and starts crying or screaming. Hey, let's not just run away. Let's take her with us because it's just easier that way.   No way.
   </p>
   <p>
    If they took her it was because they had intentions.  Their own sexual gratification or to sell her.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Podestas?  The Smith sightings? Still much to uncover.
   </p>
   <p>
    But two things just scream the Podesta involvement:
1) those dead-on sketches
2) the timing of JP deleted emails

     Also wasn't it proven they were in the country at the time and the mentions of a madeleine in the emails?

        on one hand the parents look extremely guilty and evidence points against them. on the other hand too much coincidences with the podestas.
       </p>
       <p>
        match the both it would kinda seem a likely scenario is their parents was in on this as well with the podestas. but then why would they hire a high end investigation team into this.

         of course anyone who hires "a high end investigation team" is innocent! jk. its prolly so they dont look guilty. personally i dont think the parents were in on it, however i could be wrong. the feds are scrambling because we are exposing their child rape ring. thanks to all of u helping with this investigation. god bless

         Parents could of just sold their daughter for some money.
        </p>
        <p>
         Remember, people are just another commodity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Buyers could of been the podestas. The parents sold her somehow, and "went out" leaving her alone in the hotel. This was agreed on beforehand, so the buyers went to where the child was left when she was alone. You make it look like a theft, a robbery by throwing shit around.
        </p>
        <p>
         So it could very well be that they are behind this.
        </p>
        <p>
         Then the parents have to give "sad" interviews and just act sad for some time and nobody questions it.

           If there is any, it is really an insider thing. A permutation of favours or something that isn't documented. It's so long ago that most evidence would have been destroyed or the police already got it and couldn't do anything about it.

            I was just about to ask the same thing about if any bank records or any big purchases were made from the parents shortly after the incident. but you make a great point that something like this would have been thought out. also, authorities might have tried to do the same thing. It's a really good, plausible theory that the parents were in on it.

             Oh and by the way, when I say most evidence will be hidden or destroyed by now, by all means, don't let that deter you from digging.

             No big purchases but they were in debt and used part of the funds offered by people to help searching Maddie to pay off their home loan. It made headlines back then and people were somehow shocked by that.

           This is my theory.. May be very far fetched but to me it's the only one that makes sense.
          </p>
          <p>
           Podesta's are friends with Anthony Weiner (looked into for child sex offences) and Jeffrey Epstein. Jeffrey Epstein has a relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell (who is English and has gotten under aged girls for Epstein to have sex with. Ghislaine Maxwell's Dad, Robert Maxwell was a British MP. Clement Freud - a British MP, recently discovered as a serial paedophile and rapist. Clement Freud shared an office with Greville Janner - an MP from Leicester, a paedophile and a Freemason who shared the same Freemasonry Organisation Templar Lodge as.. Gerry McCann! I know this is a massive long chain of government paedophiles, but it does link..

            Not really far fetched. It's always "I know a guy that knows a guy" so you could be on to something!

      I couldn't locate where the Podesta's were during te time she was kidnapped. There was talk of a holiday "see you when you get back" but it wasn't clear who it was directed to or what really was happening.

     Yeah while we're at it, might as well throw in the JonBenet Ramsey case. I watched a recent deal on TV which looked at several different theories and besides getting a really nasty vibe from the family, I got this feeling they were loaning out their daughter to elites or something. I think the most plausible theory they pushed was the botched burglary, but the facts don't all line up.
    </p>

     It's great people are looking into and revitalizing unsolved mysteries/crimes/cold cases. A lot of this stuff isn't just coincidence anymore with the missing children, guilty families and police coverups/failures, time to crack it open.

     I think the parents could be involved, I heard the father is a mason. They could of sold her off for a high fee, perhaps to Podesta's etc But it doesn't seem that logical that they (Podesta's) would be the ones involved in the actual kidnapping when they could pay an underling to do it, but maybe they get off on the thrill. Also Podesta has been to Portugal in the past this has been

     I don't know if this was just aired in the US but over here in the UK there has been no comments from the police about knowing who did it and not being able to make arrests because of international laws. MM is a massive deal over here and everyone would know if the police had released any statement. Typical US MSM going into crisis to divert attention from Pizza Gate.

    In order to have a police sketch, you need a witness, right? Who exactly described those two to the police? Is there a police witness report of the incident? Maybe there is more to the events of that evening. Perhaps finding the original publishing of the sketch could help lead down that path?

    what international laws would impede extradiction of a suspected child abuser/kidnapper to another jurisdiction? 
Some jurisdictions don't extradict their own citizens, but is that what they mean by 'international law'? And why was there no outcry about that, but narrated as 'unfortunately nothing can be done about this'? If it was alleged copyright infringement (hi Kim Dotcom!) or drugs, the suspect would have been detained by any means possible if the stakes to the establishment are high enough. Ah wait, my questions above are more rhetoric than they really need answers... (unless a legal specialist has some more to say about the issue here...)

    Man this McCann stuff makes me uneasy. I'm not at the point of saying the Podestas did it, but something suspicious went on with them around the same time so.. I miss when the worst things I researched weren't real current looking most likely pedophile ring wtf is happening.

     It would be out of character. The Podestas are near the center of the web, and were powerful people during that time period. They take their pizza delivered (not pickup), from evidence we have.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then again, they're on the psychopath spectrum so its hard to rule out anything.

    News originally came out in
    <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2016/04/28/british-cops-know-who-snatched-maddie-5848349/">
     April
    </a>
    and was supposedly uncovered by the Sun, a UK tabloid that has a record of not being completely honest in the past. The original Sun article isn't clear on who the source of the information is but does clearly state that Scotland Yard refused to discuss the case with them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Take any article that originally appeared in the Sun with a pinch of salt.
    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/26/how-the-suns-truth-about-hillsborough-unravelled">
     A lot of people in the UK boycott the paper due to various issues over the years such as the damaging lies they told about the Hillsborough disaster.

    The biggest connection aside from the pictures is the fact that our podesta leaks start 1 day after the kidnapping (or was it 1 day after their pictures were posted?  I dont remember).  This implies he completely wiped his emails when he could feel the heat.  The dates matching so well could be a coincidence, but we also know they were in portugal at the same time.  Portgugal holds 0.14 per cent of the world population.. so just the fact he was in portugal instead of the other 99.86 per cent of the world makes its another "bullseye" coincidence lining up with two other "bullseye" coincidences. 1 more connection, even the smallest one would easily be enough to prosecute them both.

     We don't know he was in prortugal at the same time. That would be a bombshell.

      I was wondering if maybe they were people of interest so avoiding a return. That clears it up, thanks.

     Andorra doesn't have very strict child trafficking laws.
    </p>
    <p>
     Since it's schengen area, there are no borders between spain and portugal. There are in Andorra, but it's pretty easy going in through the Mountain.

    Anybody else feel like this makes no sense whatsoever? Of course they can't arrest Portuguese citizens, but they could request extradition, or present their evidence to Portuguese authorities so
    <em>
     they
    </em>
    can make an arrest.  This just seems like an excuse to close the case.

     Yes wouldn't european laws and efforts to integrate police services stand before "international"? These are two countries in the heart of europe, well britain is a bit strange... see this 2013 article:
