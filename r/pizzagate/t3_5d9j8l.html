        <strong>Active User Growth +%300 this A.M.</strong>
        <p><p>I woke up this morning to see over 3000 active users in this sub. It normally hovers around 10-15% of total subscribers. I know this sub is growing fast, but does anyone else have an explanation for current traffic levels? Is this a mass CTR brigade or did someone with a following back link to r/pizzagate?</p></p>

        <p><p>As a Turkey's citizen, we are trying to get rid of pyschopaths like these in our country. 
Turkish people are very effective in social media [here] (https://eksisozluk.com/entry/64105877) and [here] ( https://forum.donanimhaber.com/m_121807091/tm.htm)
websites are very popular in Turkey but only turkish language so you may not understand.. but you should know that we're with you in this investigation. </p></p>

<p>Im know firmly in belief that Globalist/Clinton USA wanted Gulen in charge to destroy you guys. </p></p>

        <p><p>I don't think Turkish voters think that deeply, some of them, young&amp;educated ones, believe that to deceive themselves maybe. Like the commenter up there. I don't believe in "coup" attempt, i can't just say goverment did it or g√ºlen did it, but whoever did it fucked up pretty bad, you'd think globalist/clinton would come up with a better plan.
I'm not well knowledged about Putin so i will not make comments on that.</p></p>

        <p><p>well they probably didnt think Russia would help</p>

<p>with Edrogans existing infrastructure probably wasnt hard to put down. maybe Russia hacked Gulen and gave everything to Edrogan. How epic would that be. </p></p>

        <p><p>Exactly i believe Putin saved Erdogan's ass on coup attemp. Otherwise he couldn't make it out of his hotel in Marmaris and land his plane on Ataturk Airport (IST Main Airport) while F-16 were flying low on heli's gunning Ankara.
The game is much bigger and older. Good old stories of WW1 and WW2. </p></p>

<p>Do you not care he talks about woman like this? do you not care about all the journalists he silences because they do not represent him? Do you not care he and his son have ties to ISIS?</p>
<p>do you not care he censor turkey's internet? he is trying to keep you dumb. i guess it works. he is a dictator to the fullest.</p>

        <p><p>We care about them but you don't know everything. Obama is president of USA right now (january is end as i know) and he is with this paedophiles. Everybody knows him as angel. In Turkey Erdogan isn't a dictator right now and we won't allow him. Why everybody hates Turkey so much ? What is wrong eith you people. You know what press does and you still believe them.</p></p>

        <p><p>The allegations will lead to a revolution. It points to a worldwide child sex trafficking ring run by the CIA/uberwealthy as a means of control of the wealth. </p>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>The CIA and agents through which these actions are carried out, are merely the faces of something deeper. They (Podesta with 14 and fish/nun) use symbolism from pre-Christianity Judaism (I am not worried or critical of everyday Jewish people. This is different). </p>
<p>My guess is this an organization developed a couple of hundred years ago by wealthy German bankers, or... the Vatican.</p>
<p>I am skeptical of anyone who says they can prove these claims, because it is almost guesswork as to who would be running these satanism (fake) rings, with lethal consequences. There are so many culprits. However, I'd be happy to be convinced. </p></p>

        <p><p>Yup, this pedophile ring is the mechanism by which our politicians are controlled. </p>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein is a Mossad asset, and they used Rape Island to compromise and blackmail our politicians.</p>
<p>This is why the establishment threw Hillary under the bus... because exposing these pedophile rings threatens to expose the mechanism of control. Hillary is a temporary person, whereas the pedophile ring wants to continue operation indefinitely </p></p>

        <p><p>The good work has been repeatedly been mentioned on The Donald not just in posts but in comments. Have seen steady slide from leaks related r's like hillaryforprison and DNCleaks. You now have the autists on your side if there's teeth to this they will find it.</p>
<p>It's also relatable you might care less for politics but everyone would happily have a turn the thumbscrews here</p></p>
