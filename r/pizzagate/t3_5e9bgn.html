        <strong>This is a serious issue. Can we use a different hashtag to denote that fact?</strong>

        <p><p>Yeah, it's just a touch too late. Someone warned early when this case was in /r/conspiracy that calling it something cutesy like pizzagate would detract from the seriousness of the issue. But it stuck, so what can you do.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yeah, "pizzagate" looks kinda silly. But I don't think a different name would help...</p></p>
