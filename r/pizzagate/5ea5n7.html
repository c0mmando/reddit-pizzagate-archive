    Honestly the top thread on this sub right now is good. The guy claimed to be a journalist and it showed because he summarized the evidence very well.

     These people are all in the same social circles and they're intent on spinning facts to make us appear crazy. They're not interested in the truth.

     "modernist murals and paintings from friends of Mr. Alefantis". So they admit that Arrington de Dionyso is a friend of Alefantis, but claim that work like this (NSFW!) https://i.imgsafe.org/faa4aebd7d.jpg is just "modernist"?!

      They don't need any help.  A huge problem here is so many people mixing in worthwhile questioning with outlandish, extreme, or internally inconsistent conclusions, which most of the time are completely unnecessary to the discussion.  Even the self proclaimed journalist has a hodgepodge of poor grammar, links to places with bizarre claims like "freedom cures hunger," and other nonsense interspersed with more salient stuff.
     </p>
     <p>
      This happens so much so on here, it almost seems a deliberate effort to delegitimize.

       I agree with that. Some of it is just immaturity and a lot of people being new to this and not knowing how to deal with it. But there are definitely disinformation disseminators here too.

     I agree.. very simple ones.. maybe one just going from Podestas - &gt; Jimmy -&gt; Comet Pizza -&gt; All his pictures. I would do it but I don't even have Photoshop on here. I just noticed the lack of direction on here and someone saying "well at least they mention us by name so if they come here and read a little bit they'll figure it out". I think we should have a big ol' welcome banner with a red pill for them as soon as they walk in the door.

    I hope it's understood that after they wrote an article like that there is a good chance that they are complicit in all of this. Nevermind the fact they have proven to be political puppets. Ask yourself, what is the NYT motivation? They didn't have to write that nonsense, but they did...

    The main thing to shock them into wanting to learn more is that the richest man in Mexico, Carlos Slim, owns 17% of the NYT and is merging his foundation with the Clinton Foundation, which he's donated 6 figures to.

    What is that going to accomplish? They are literally paid to lie. That's right. LIE to everyone, so they can keep their bosses happy. They're people with journalism degrees and PhD's, do you think they need our help to find the truth and report it? Wake up, people. It's an information war. Propoganda at it's finest.

     It was in reference to the general population that would come through, not so much the staff. I agree with all of that though!
