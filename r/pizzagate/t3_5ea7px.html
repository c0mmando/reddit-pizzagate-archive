        <strong>Convince me this is real ( initially believed, now skeptical )</strong>
        <p><p>Hi,  I am not a shill,  I made a Youtube video on this topic around the time it first happened https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMUvdjUGrz4 </p>
<p>As you can see I thought the evidence was very convincing when I first saw it,  however following some twitter conversations I started to doubt the strength of the evidence for the following reasons - </p>
<p>1)  " 14 / Fish " image is actually from a tweet about marine preservation </p>
<p>2)  " Drugs and money " image - the drug is Xanax, a common benzo anti-anxiety drug,  while it can be used for rape it also has recreational use.  " Ping pong in london " could refer to " partying with mates from ping pong "</p>
<p>3) Seemingly no evidence that the " large walk in freezer " and " trenches /  underground tunnels "  photographs were actually taken at the CometPingPong site. </p>
<p>4) " Child taped to table "  - customers commonly complain that children are running around causing havok at the restaurant. </p>
<p>I still think its one of the most convincing conspiracy theories I have ever seen,  but I need to see more proof that its more than just that. </p></p>

        <p><p>It's obvious that the Clintons are screwing with Haiti. Just look at all the Haitians complaining to Trump at how Clintons were exploiting them and committing crimes all over the place for 15-25 years, and NONE OF THIS WAS BROADCASTED ON TV. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkZiUDPE19g</p>
<p>None of those four points convinced me for this conspiracy. Especially the "child taped to a table", it's definitely an additional questionable photo in the presence of 100s of other damning photos. Look at the COLLECTIVE. He uploads 100s of questionable photos, and has a community of followers that also upload questionable material and comments regarding underaged children. You can point a single photo out and say "this could be normal", but that's just being in denial. No doubt there's be no proof, as that's the whole point. Pretend you're a drug dealer in Asia, and you've got a community of drug addicts on Facebook. You'd make implicit posts but you wouldn't upload damning evidence unless you're a dumbed down drug addict yourself. </p></p>

        <p><p>good point,  I guess if you look at the larger picture it looks differently,  but most of the individual pieces are down to interpretation.  </p>
<p>I think think that because I found that some of it was taken out of context and presented as evidence when it wasn't necessarily,<br>
it threw the entire thing into doubt for me,  perhaps excessively so though. </p>
<p>Another thing though that contributed to my skepticism -  if it was indeed real,   why did the evidence sort of taper off for a while ? 
I kept saying just raid the place if you think its real,  get 50 guys with ARs and body armour,     the fact that nobody did that suggested that they only half believed it was true. </p></p>

        <p><p>You do realize that if this was uncovered, hundreds of elites all over the world would be exposed for being involved in child trafficking right? And these "elites" are the ones who control economy, Fortune 500 companies, and especially media. Why do you think twitter has filtered pizzagate? It's because this scandal has become no joke. People have been killed for trying to expose this.... it's not surprising that people are scared. We're all staying safe, using secure browsers, hoping that the public will find out about this before it gets buried.</p>
<p>Notice how the media generally LOVES scandals, but all of a sudden pizzagate is something that needs to be buried to the ground? It's because the media creates artificial scandals for profit, and they allowed for minor scandals, but they know that this scandal is the truth that they have to hide.</p></p>

        <p><p>well I know spiritcooking was removed from twitter trend when it was going viral a few days before the election but I figured that was to protect clinton. </p>
<p>CPP never seemed to gain traction at that time, possibly because people were still trying to decide what to make of the spiritcooking thing, I was trying to push it to big youtubers but they didn't seem too interested. </p></p>

        <p><p>4) " Child taped to table " - customers commonly complain that children are running around causing havok at the restaurant.</p>
<p>So, its an acceptable practice to tape both of their arms to a table? What type of person would see this as reasonable? </p></p>

        <p><p>Right. I forgot James is allowed to have a sense of humor. He is an person that should be allowed to express himself. Must be the reason for all the other weird things like the Podesta's taste in art. Case Closed then. Lets move on. but wait what about the 5 figure donations to comet? or joshua the employees twitter? must just be freedom of self expression too. my bad. </p></p>

        <p><p>I have to commit that some things seem strange in a certain way like the coded language in the Emails, but some things seem also to build up to make it bigger.</p>
<p>Like the big freezing room = killroom or a hole yeah bury someone...seems to me like common jokes that ozhers also would do</p></p>

        <p><p>A lot of these can be written off as off color comments.  I have a very dark sense of humor, so do lots of my friends. We say all kinds of awful shit.    We've all seen dexter, so calling a big freezer room a kill room is nothing special to me.</p>
<p>The ones that really got to me, were the sexual jokes on instagram in the context of pictures of babies/kids.  I mean it's one thing to call a friend a chickenlover, hotard, slut, whore, dirtbag, fuckhead, etc.  It's another to do it on a picture of an infant or small child.   It just seems so out of place that I can't imagine my most messed up friends thinking that was appropriate, or anything other than extremely creepy.  Even people on his own instagram were calling some of the stuff creepy.   </p>
<p>I still can't find a way to reconcile that in my mind as nothing.</p></p>

        <p><p>Maybe the function of pizzagate will be it got the authorities to investigate. </p>
<p>You know whats worse than a person who is blissfully ignorant? a person who actively turns a blind eye. The people who are investigating this are doing it because they feel they can help save children. It is not to take down any of the elite but to save the children and discouraging this action is not responsible. </p></p>

        <p><p>I know what you mean, when I first started following all this I was totally convinced of this huge conspiracy that was about to break any day. 
Now I feel like caught between a barrage of politically motivated psy ops, not knowing what to believe, which means they succeeding at their job. There is definitely something fishy with this podesta character, but the more tenuous theories flying around are doing nothing for the legitimacy of the issue. </p>
<p>To be taken seriously, investigation has to be built of strong stepping-stones of factual evidence, not pictures of people eating pizza. </p></p>

        <p><p>It could be an op like you say, and we all know that, but that doesn't change the evidence that's presented here. Podesta is free to deny any of the evidence, yet he hasn't so far. The wikileaks emails are real, and the discoveries we've made are based off legitimate sources from their own people (i.e. Washington Post, NYT, Whois data, FBI, etc.)</p></p>

        <p><p>I still thought it was weird and there was maybe a 10 to 20% chance of it being true even though as I said I became more doubtful,  but then again I thought " hipsters are weird though " </p>
<p>I said to myself I would wait until more evidence surfaces which seems to be happening now </p></p>

        <p><p>Look into:</p>
<p>Johnny Gosch
Franklin Cover up
Dutroux Affair
Iran Contra / CIA Cocaine</p>
<p>Those stories help frame what's being talked about now, and understanding how something massive can exist in plain sight without anyone realizing it.</p>
<p>This is more than just some pizza places being fronts for this. That may not even be true.  But there is definitely a massive trafficking/pedophile ring across the world, and it's very likely that the Clinton foundation has ties to it in some way/shape/form.</p></p>

        <p><p>Just to add one to the big list of creepy pictures, there's a picture of an infant that has text below it saying "hotard - someone that is both a whore and a retard." I severely doubt that any culture could possibly find that funny, appropriate or anything apart from creepy. Alefantis is a very sick person, no doubt about it.</p></p>
