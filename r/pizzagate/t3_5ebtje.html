        <strong>[META] I own the domain Pizzagate.us, what should I put on it?</strong>
        <p><p>I'm willing to put whatever you guys think is best on it. I've been following the story but that's about it. I was thinking of some sort of chronological documenting of the story or something. Starting with Podesta emails, show precedents for this happening all over the world, Related videos. Don't really know, but I think the domain can be kind of useful. I really would like something I can just show to a normal person and have them get slightly woke from it.</p></p>

        <p><p>If they did ANY real research, they should've seen the instagram photos. And if they had ANY intention of being even remotely objective, they would've included them in the article to let readers decide for themselves how creepy they are.</p></p>

        <p><p>Why is it so hard for them to ask the guy "can you understand why people might be alarmed at you posting pictures of children being restrained in your restaurant and you referring to your friends on ig as chickenlovers, a term for gay men who are attracted to children?"</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't agree. It's important to walk people through why the story is poorly written. Not everyone understands why certain characterizations are highly manipulative. </p></p>

        <p><p>i respectfully disagree. NYT has name value. it draws people. we use their hastily written bogus of an article to bring forth the disturbing, thought provoking evidence we have. this domain could actually reach out to a lot of normies.</p></p>

        <p><p>First off, it's good to keep in mind what <a href="http://pedocrats.com/">pedocrats</a> already has up so that you're not doing any duplicate work.</p>
<p>Other than that, it would be good to have it be an archive of material that actively helps/defends the legitimacy of the issue, like the current sticky threads:</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e72zv/on_the_legitimacy_of_this_investigation_with_an/</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5ebh01/a_blowbyblow_indepth_factcheck_of_the_new_york/</p>
<p>and stuff about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dvlky/keep_it_up_guys_a_few_things_are_bugging_me_about/da7nl8u/?context=3">the broader history of the phenomenon</a> outside of pizzagate in general. Because we can't trust that this sub won't just get wiped by the admins at some point.</p>
<p>And possibly also material that shows people how they might be able to get actively involved with the investigation, like by linking to the <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#pizzagate:matrix.org">chat</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cmuii/collaboration_tools/">collaboration tools</a> on the sidebar, and having a prominent note about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5e2hb9/a_definitive_guide_to_staying_safe/">security procedures</a></p>
<p>EDIT: Shit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5edior/admins_will_be_banning_this_subreddit_at_4pm_pst/">I was right</a>... Archive shit ASAP OP!</p></p>

        <p><p>I believe you should post everything ranging from the Podesta emails with code words in them, artwork owned by Tony Podesta, Art within Comet Pizza and Ping Pong, Instagram posts by Jimmy Comet, links to good posts in this subreddit regarding the McCann child and it's connections to the Podesta brothers etc. Anything good really.</p></p>

        <p><p>Showcasing the god damn hints that started this whole thing is not tinfoil bullshit, it is simply presenting why this whole reddit started in the first fucking place. It's not presenting them as evidence, it's showcasing why speculation started.</p></p>

        <p><p>Leave out all references to spirit cooking, Satanism, and the occult.</p>
<p>Do not mention Comet Ping Pong, Alefantis's Instagram, or Heavy Breathing. In fact leave Alefantis himself out of it except insofar as he's connected to the Clinton Foundation and David Brock.</p>
<p>I'd also advise against bringing up the McCann case as it's extremely tenuous at best.</p>
<p>Focus extensively on the WikiLeaks Podesta emails, the Clinton Foundation, Haiti/Beyond Borders, Herbert Sandler, David Brock, CtR (especially their flooding of Facebook groups with CP), Brock's blackmail and subsequent lawsuit, etc.</p>
<p>These are all unassailable.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes.</p>
<p>The story here is about the Clinton Foundation's links to child sex trafficking. Silsby is front and center in that.</p></p>

        <p><p>The emails are a good place to start for sure. Perhaps find a decent short video to show.
Use things which are completely factual to begin, leave the occult type speculative shit for the end.</p>
<p>Try and tell a bit of a story and try not to look spammy. No all caps posting, no random text of crazy sizes in all red, if you want to emphasize use bolded text like an normal person. Nothing spells crazy conspiracy nonsense like giant bolded red text. </p>
<p>I would start with a description of the wikileaks emails being suspicious. Pizza related map? Walnut sauce? dominoes on on cheese pizza instead of pasta? </p>
<p>Okay sure, they could be passed off as foodies, but be real, a foodie message is going to outline in detail what was used like hey I got this rare truffle from europe for 300 bones and I want to make a cream reduction sauce to put over our handmade spinach pasta... you get the idea. Foodies aren't like yo lets get cheese pizza for an hour.</p>
<p>I would move on to some of the imagery found by the owner of comet, and point out the pizza place next door having a pedo symbol which was removed shortly after, and how the pedo pics were removed from IG. Show caris james taped to the taped, show the murder room, show them digging and point out how  no permits were filed and they were basically illegally digging. Add a hotlink to reference info about how there is old subway tunnels underground, but don't delve into that then, maybe on a later page.</p>
<p>I think the next most damning piece of evidence is to show the link between alefantis and the podestas, and most importantly, get pictures of maddy and the evidence suggesting that the podestas kidnapped her. </p>
<p>Anyways hope this helps goodluck</p></p>

        <p><p>You may already know this but...</p>
<p>If that's your real name and email in WHOIS, you should probably not put anything on the webpage. WHOIS protection is too late at this point.</p>
<p>It seems people are putting up bogus DMCA reports to take down website on pizzagate content, so it would be best to use a non-DMCA complaint hosting service. Somewhere in countries like Netherlands is pretty good, they only respond from court orders from their own country.</p>
<p>Using Cloudflare to protect from DDOS is also a good idea. Use the I'm under attack mode, if something happens.</p>
<p>The security measures that are posted here are not suited for hosting your own domain, I don't think.</p></p>

        <p><p>It's really me. I don't see the problem though. If they suicide me then I get put out of my miserable world and if they don't then no loss. As long as I'm not tortured before they suicide me, it'd be all good. </p></p>

        <p><p>it's a veiled compliment in my opinion. We're not making up stories or looking into things that only a few of us see; this getting big and every attempt to shut us down makes it clearer that we're getting somewhere. Keep it up, this matters</p></p>

<p>The one IG photo they are not allowed to show, you could also show. It's of four young girls and references a 'double sleepover at Comet'.</p></p>
