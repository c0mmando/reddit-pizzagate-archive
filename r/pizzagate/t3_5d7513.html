        <p><p>I've got a request for anyone tech savvy enough to check it out.</p>
<p>But these missing children bug me, because does anyone recall back when unaccompanied minors were flooding the Texas/Mexican Border?</p>
<p>I would like to know if there is any clarification as to what happened to those children and if we have any way of knowing that they either went back to their country of origin or orphanages or sadly did they fall into the sick hands of these perverts.</p>

        <p><p>Don't know if this is related to pizza gate but organizations/companies implicated suggest an international operation. </p>
<p>The guardian claims that many may have been victimized by human trafficking groups. Maybe in the future, we'll be able to connect all the dots.. </p></p>

        <p><p>Might be, its too far fetched as of yet. The US and EU is heavily involved in the refugee crisis. But it's also well known that in Arabic countries child sex slaves aren't something completely uncommon. It's likely that most of the people in those trafficking groups of refugees use the children for their own pleasure. It can be anything and pedophile activity is widespread in Islamic countries due to their religion. </p></p>

        <p><p>keep in mind that most of these "children" are teenagers who happen to spend their time outside of the refuge accommodation and registration. i worked in a refuge accommodation in berlin for a short period of time and there were so many people "missing" who were just living somewhere on their own and some came back at some point. the system is very broken. someone who  unofficially does not live in the accommodation still gets a bed and food every day. actually 1/3 of our beds were empty even though oficially we were full to the limits.</p></p>
