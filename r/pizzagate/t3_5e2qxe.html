        <p><p>-go to Wikileaks.org --&gt; Podesta emails
- search for term "thelema". Open the only email that contains this term. https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39459</p>
<p>-Confused? I was too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition of "thelema" according to http://www.thelema101.com/intro: 
"Thelema ("They-LEE-mah" or "They-LEH-mah") is a Greek word meaning "will" or "intention". It is also the name of a new spiritual philosophy which has arisen over the past several hundred years and is now gradually becoming established worldwide. One of the earliest mentions of this philosophy occurs in the classic Gargantua and Pantagruel written by Francois Rabelais in 1532. One episode of this epic adventure tells of the founding of an "Abbey of Thelema" as an institution for the cultivation of human virtues, which Rabelais identified as being squarely opposite the prevailing Christian proprieties of the time. The sole rule of the Abbey of Thelema was: "Do what thou wilt". This has become one of the basic tenets of Thelemic philosophy today. Although touched upon by various prominent visionary thinkers in the following few hundred years, the seeds of Thelema sown by Rabelais eventually came to fruition in the early part of this century when developed by an Englishman named ALEISTER CROWLEY. Crowley was a poet, author, mountaineer, magician, and member of the occult society known as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. In 1904, while traveling in Egypt with his wife Rose, Crowley became inextricably involved in a series of events which he claimed to inaugurate a new aeon of human evolution. These culminated in April when Crowley entered a state of trance and wrote down the three chapters of 220 verses which came to be called The Book of the Law (also known as Liber AL and Liber Legis). Among other things, this book declared: "The word of the law is Thelema" and "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law"." 
Now...</li>
<li>Take note of who this email is from- (John Demos).</li>
<li>Google (or duckduckgo) ---&gt; "John Demos"</li>
<li>
<p>(Hint: add "Putnam" ---&gt; "John [Putnam] Demos")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WHAT THE FUCK ARE THE CHANCES OF THIS SHIT</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-From Wikipedia, "John Putnam Demos is an American author and historian. He has written two books which discuss witch-hunts and has discovered that one of his own ancestors was John Putnam Senior, ancestor of the Putnam family which was prominent in the Salem witch trials.[1]"</p>
<p>...guys? I really need help/input...badly. This is just a coincidence, right? </p>
<p>Oh, and it doesn't help that I read in a summary of one of his books about the Salem Witch Trials, that he writes through the perspective of a girl named "Rachel Clinton".</p>
<p>I haven't looked into that though. </p>
<p>Maybe the name is just another... coincidence.</p></p>

        <p><p>In grade school the Salem Witch Trials were glossed over and described as people blaming each other for bad harvests, mental illness, etc. Never really understood why they'd burn people on a whim.</p>
<p>Now in light of all this it seems like there was definitely some spirit cooking going on back in the 1600's</p></p>

        <p><p>HOLY SHIT.</p>
<p>http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/16/nyregion/entertaining-the-devil-in-connecticut.html</p>
<p>"WITCHCRAFT is still alive in the United States," said John Putnam Demos. The statement sounds like a headline in a supermarket tabloid, and coming from Mr. Demos, a quiet-spoken and scholarly man in his late 50's, seems almost incredulous. "</p>
<p>"Excluding the more famous witch trials in Salem, Mass., Connecticut was the real witchcraft center of New England for most of the 17th century, said Mr. Demos. The first person in the New World convicted and executed for witchcraft, he said, was Alice Young of Windsor who was hanged in 1647. The first couple to be hanged for witchcraft was John and Joan Carrington, of Wethersfield, in 1651. "</p>
<p>CONNECTICUT HAS THE SAME NAME AS THE WITCHCRAFT CENTER OF NEW ENGLAND.</p>

<p>Connecticut Ave forms one of the sides of the upside down pentagram, used by witches who practice black magick.

<p>Comet Ping Pong and the other places with pedo symbols/clinton connections are on (you guessed it) Connecticut. https://dcpizzagate.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/image91.png</p>
<p>Street names are often named after historical significance. </p>
<p>Maybe this is where there is a lot of witchcraft/occult/sacrifice activity. </p>
<p>It's like this cancer spread from Europe, came hear, slaughtered the natives, and then took root deep in the foundations of the new America. </p>
<p>It is no coincidence that literally all of the civil planning and architecture of DC is modeled after witchcraft/egyptology/occult themes. </p></p>

        <p><p>John Podesta may be a practicing witch. </p>
<p>Or I guess they would call it a warlock? </p>
<p>Who knows, these people are nuts. </p>
<p>But all those creepy images of his hands, his picture of ritual cannibalism hanging in his office, his attending the spirit cooking demonology. It would make sense.</p></p>

        <p><p>The use of thelema is odd, and the names <em>are</em> a creepy coincidence, but I think that's all it was. I say that knowing I'll be downvoted into oblivion for it. In the email, John Demos implies he's in Chicago. John Putman Demos seems to be at Yale or Harvard. Also, from his email address, this John Demos either has "George" as a middle name, or his middle initials are "G. E.". Googling turned up more than one John G Demos in IL. Maybe further investigation would identify which one wrote the email, if anyone cares to do it.</p></p>

<p>They are talking about a piece of land in Greece that would belong to "their family" which is not really relevant for our inquiry tho.</p></p>

        <p><p>OH. ALSO. Do a google image search for "thelema". I've seen that symbol before somewhere on here or /pol within the past couple of weeks, but i can't remember exactly when or where, or the reason that someone posted it- but I do know I've seen it, or at least something that looked very similar.
