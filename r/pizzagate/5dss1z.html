    So I hopped on this bandwagon a couple of days ago, and finally started taking action when I was sold on the evidence. I'm currently putting together the angel round of funding for an A.I. startup. This morning I two different emails(not even phones calls), from our advisor, and one of our angels.
   </p>
   <p>
    Our angel pulled a substantial amount and possibly delayed our start by at least a month. The advisor who has been with us for the last 6 months has bounded abruptly via email.
   </p>
   <p>
    This all comes after I retweeted 2 #PizzaGate links, and made my own tweet on the matter which wild just a reaction to the possibility of this being real. This comes as a great surprise to me, but it may be a super quicidence. Asked both of them if I could chat over the phone, but haven't received a reply yet. The angel viewed the email and didn't reply.
   </p>
   <p>
    PSA: You might want to be a little more careful with your identity. Wasn't thinking much of it, but it may have cost me.
   </p>

    EDIT: Something fishy going on with Silicon Valley, VC connections, and Universities (Stanford ML department).

    Yea that's a tough one. I only share pizza stories with people I trust and even then it's semi-anonymous... tough balance between getting the word out and damaging your own rep. Anyone starting to see how challenging this is to wake people up on this subject?

    It is best to always take business "partners" to extremes. Let them steal $2,000 early rather than wait for them to clear an account of $50,000 kinda thing

    Rough times. This is all of our problem (you are not to blame for pointing something out) we must be brave here as we go. people bring sexuality and these worse things to the forefront now and we must act, not out of hate but when they do manufacture it to the masses it is too late. And they will try no doubt about it,

    Were your retweets and tweet public or private? I'm assuming they were public but I wanted to make sure.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yeah, sometimes I desperately want to go out on a limb and just post a Pizzagate facebook post, at least send out a line to see if anyone else on my friends list is in the know, but I do have a lot of professional contacts on my facebook friends list. It's not worth wrecking my career by blasting it out with no context--I'm verrrrry slowly having one-on-one conversations with my more open-minded friends.

     I've always shared articles on rapes and pedophile rings, but even I have not really crossed that one besides with my family.  I've stepped up on the articles of government involvement in them- like Rotherham or the Turkey or Dubai situations on rape.   I think we have to expose them to those things before dropping the nukes on them.

    Regarding the University angle, this guy is associated with a branch of The Family International, which used to be called the Children of God church, which was founded by a pedo and some of the members were arrested.
   </p>

    J. Gordon Melton is an interesting character: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Gordon_Melton "John Gordon Melton (born September 19, 1942) is an American religious scholar who was the founding director of the Institute for the Study of American Religion and is currently a research specialist in religion and New Religious Movements with the Department of Religious Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He is a Distinguished Senior Fellow at Baylor University's Institute for Studies of Religion.[1] He is an ordained minister in the United Methodist Church, and he is affiliated with the New Cult Awareness Network,[2] an organization operated by the Church of Scientology.
   </p>
   <p>
    He is the author of more than twenty-five books, including several encyclopedias, handbooks, and almanacs on American religion and new religious movements. He lives in Santa Barbara, California.
   </p>
   <p>
    His areas of research include major religious traditions, new religions and alternative religions, occultism and parapsychology, New Age, and vampirology."
   </p>
   <p>
    Here's what Melton thinks about ex-members of Family International: https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/J._Gordon_Melton "Ex-members, even those with righteous complaints, tend to reconstruct their experiences — ambiguous situations at worst — into totally negative encounters. They tend to demonize the leaders and turn the members into zombielike followers. Harmless comments are recast into sinister threats, group jargon into conspirational fantasies."
