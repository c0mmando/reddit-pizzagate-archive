      It would be 0 if it was a decryption, but this is gematria, a weird numerology thing that assigns different values to each letter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The code and the sentence in the post's title both happen to add up to 698. Along with an infinite combination of other sentences, including others that likely support our case.

        No, Occam's Razor says that everything gematria-related was static and that this is something crypto-related, since the latter is used extremely frequently in the intel community and the former is not.
       </p>
       <p>
        You realize gematria is literally just doing things like a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, adding the sum of a whole sentence/phrase, and looking for things with the same number, right?

          Gematria is merely a system that assigns every letter a number. Adding up these individual numbers will give you a total. That is the gematria number.
         </p>
         <p>
          The random string of letters at the bottom of z-sec.io and "Missing British Girl Madeline McCann Portugal Two Zero Zero Seven" both add up to a total of 698.

          Technically, yes, but one with an infinite number of possible ways to decode it. Gematria is meaningless. Here's one /r/conspiracy found a few months ago that is based off of the word count of one of the emails: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4s5pq9/turns_out_if_you_look_up_the_gematria_of_the/
         </p>
         <p>
          You can find gematria connections in
          <em>
           everything
          </em>
          if you try hard enough.

          I'm sure you could find plenty of other phrases that work "perfectly" and others that completely contradict us too.
         </p>
         <p>
          A few months ago, /r/conspiracy found that 2322 (the number of words in a specific Comey email) is both "Help Me, Hillary Clinton Is Holding My Family Hostage" and "Barrack Hussein Obama The Antichrist of Revelation."
         </p>
         <p>
          ...along with millions of other phrases that mean literally nothing in context.

           How could anyone possibly support this gematria nonsense? When sum all the letters in a sentence together you throw out almost ALL the information in the sentence: it goes from like 168 bits down to just 10. There are more possible sentences that match it than stars in the visible universe. People should learn a little bit about information theory and bayes theorem before even
           <em>
            trying
           </em>
           to form conclusions.
          </p>
          <p>
           Edit: what I said is true for strings of approximately that length, and sentences of english words will have less entropy, but the end effect is roughly the same.

          I'm a supporter of Pizzagate but a moderate who worries that some of this more out there shit will just get us written off as internet loons. I figured being in this position would just make it a matter of time before I was accused of being a shill, when really my concern is just that stuff like gematria always makes these theories the laughingstock of the uninitiated.
         </p>
         <p>
          The fact that the police sketches look uncannily like the Podesta brothers is a fantastic piece of evidence that makes the McCann lead absolutely worth exploring, but you can use gematria to make it look like
          <em>
           anything
          </em>
          is connected.

            This isn't really a "lead," though. A given number will yield an infinite number of gematria sentences. I saw a 4chan thread since your last comment where someone had figured out several other seemingly pro-Pizzagate messages with the same gematria.

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4s5pq9/turns_out_if_you_look_up_the_gematria_of_the/">
             A few months ago, /r/conspiracy used the number of words in a Comey email to come up with both "Help Me, Hillary Clinton Is Holding My Family Hostage" and "Barrack Hussein Obama The Antichrist of Revelation."
            </a>

            I haven't said anything about "treading lightly," and I'm not sure why you think I am advocating that position. I think we should be pushing and pushing hard. I just said this particular finding is meaningless.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the less ridiculous we look to outsiders, the more people that will join our cause, and the more likely we will see some resolution to this.

       There was a similar use of gematria when Comey finished the first investigation into Hillary and concluded there that she should not be indicted. Some information from the press release was dumped into the gematria website and the line that returned was something along the lines of "Hillary Clinton is holding my family hostage. Please help."
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately there were also things in there like "Barack Hussein Obama is the anti Christ" that were strangely specific but also obviously not the intended message. Ultimately the whole thing was written off as coincidental.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference here is that it accurately states the nationality, name, location and date of the girl's disappearance... Still, I'm bothered by the fact that because of the nature of gematria, we'll never be able to prove that this message is deliberate.
      </p>
      <p>
       That fucking sucks. This could have totally be on purpose, but because it's such a shit method of decryption, well never know for sure.

        Gematrix builds up their database by people previously searching these sentences. They're not doing number crunching to determine every possible sentence each time. All this shows is that someone, at some point previously, was using their site to calculate the gematria numbers of various McCann-related sentences. So it's no surprise that those details were correct.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also, small nitpicky detail, but her nationality is British. She was abducted in Portugal.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm also familiar of the claims Comey was using gematria, which was based, mind you, off of a fucking word count of a single email, not "information from the press release." The wildly different messages they came up with just illustrates how you can use gematria to connect
        <em>
         anything
        </em>
        .

         Yeah, I know. The sentence is "'MISSING BRITISH GIRL MADELEINE MCCANN PORTUGAL TWO ZERO ZERO SEVEN'" When I said nationality, I was referring to the British part. When I said location, I was referring to the Portugal part.
        </p>
        <p>
         Also, "information from the press release" was in reference to data from the press release, as in, word count lol. I wasn't trying to oversell it. I'm fully aware how useless this decryption method is.

        So what are the other phrases that are on that list? There are some other strange ones. Talks about the devil, Amon Ra ruling the world, the devil is a loser, etc.

        He has a code on his website, that when deciphered, creates these phrases? Is that correct?

We must do everything in our power to make sure they are exposed, captured, and punished accordingly. These demons should not be walking the earth.

         I'm trying to find out how easily it is to be reversed. Or if the McCann message was it's intended use, how they went about it creating it. That message could be intended to be one of the strange ones you're referring to, but the McCann message seems more likely/relevant/intended.

          From what little I know about gematria, it's a very precise practice and the people who work in it are highly skilled individuals.
         </p>
         <p>
          Is it possible that it is meant to have MULTIPLE meanings? Obviously the McCann message sticks out like a sore thumb. It's almost undeniable that it is related in some way. Could this be relaying a message to multiple individuals? One thing that sticks out is that there are so many other possibilities that have the same value and appear to have some sort of meaning or intended phrase. Could it be possible that the owner of the website stumbled across this shit and left a code for the world to see?
         </p>
         <p>
          The FBI has been on this case for a while now. Is it possible that they have been creating fake leads to throw people off course? They could have created that website 6 months ago when they noticed people were on their heels. At the same time, why would they do this....
         </p>

          Keep digging guys. This has to be one of the biggest collective investigations in history.

           It's possible to have multiple meanings but it plays into our brains finding what they want to see/find.i know little about gematria and if it's even known to be credible. In theory everything we find could be a fake lead. Theres a whole documentary about a guy who had been fed fake leads by govt either to distract or fuck with him when trying to find out ET information.

            I took the liberty of decoding it using the "pigpen" or "Masonic" cipher that someone mentioned. picumqctlmggqoiiuuqmihimwibfmthqvcuqczqvdjmdtugmoo
Didn't find anything of significance, but all I did was plug it into gematrix. Maybe someone with a more intimate knowledge of the subject can take a look.

     The odds are pretty good considering there are zillions of sentences that could add up to 698 in gematria.  You could do the same thing with other sentences about Madeleine McCann in Portuagal in 2007 and still get the same result.  The only reason that sentence is at the top is from people googling it in the wake up pizzagate (the results are ranked by google searches).  Notice it has already skyrocketed again due to this very thread.  This crap is disinformation to make us look like crazies and distract us.

      I'm all for healthy skepticism and I think the whole simply cipher thing is an easier answer or just more false leading, but don't be ridiculous to suggest that result out of the millions of possible other entries would come up THE FIRST TIME we tried without SOMETHING being preplanned here.

       Someone in this thread posted that the page with the cipher is a forgery.  So yes, PLANNED, but by whom? Perhaps someone planned it to continue to muddy the waters in this sub and bring more non-critical thinkers into the fold?

       There's too much evidence surrounding Comet Ping Pong, the Clintons, etc, for it to be a hoax.  There are definitely shills trying to used hoaxes and other disinformation to throw us off track and make us look crazy/stupid, though.

     It's a substitution cipher and the correct substitution is not a random string of letters that was cherry-picked to add up to 698.  The decoded message is "mention shibboleet to receive a discount on your first bill."

      Bill Havre is the Registering Agent for this IT company's DC branch, a random IT security company from Georgia with no apparent actual business -- just a shell with a weird cryptic code at the bottom of their page. Havre has registered literally thousands of companies but we got drawn to him because he registered Midland Agency and Casting, run by Rachel Chandler (frequent Lolita Express flier).

       And this is a website from a company that he owns correct?

       *Edit
      </p>
      <p>
       If so is there any pictures of his companies he owns? Just useful for an infograph linking all of this to the Mccann case.

      Except the police later rescinded that statement and said it was two men, the same man theory came from a mistranslation they had with the Portuguese police.

       Link? The only "evidence" I've been presented for this argument is a statement saying they're now looking for more than one person, I've never seen anything saying the sketch was originally based on more than one person.

      Do you have anything to back it up? I know they were looking for a few different people with suspected ties, I just haven't seen anywhere that the info that it's the same person. If it can be verified that you're correct it needs to be fixed in the infographics, as well as looked at in a different light.

        So the potential link between the brothers is a coincidence.. while it
        <em>
         could
        </em>
        be either one. It's not both. That changes the importance of the efits and their(podesta) connection to this. Leads stemming from that should be viewed with much more speculation..

         Yeah the thing is what I've said above is not new, lots of people around here have said it before but people still continue to perpetuate the idea that it's sketches of two different people.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm open to the idea that police have since revised their statement to say that the sketches are based on two eye witness testimonies, in which case it could be different people, but I've yet to see evidence of this.
        </p>
        <p>
         And just look how many downvotes I've gotten above...

     Bill Havre is the Registering Agent for this IT company's DC branch, a random IT security company from Georgia with no apparent actual business -- just a shell with a weird cryptic code at the bottom of their page.  Havre has registered literally thousands of companies but we got drawn to him because he registered Midland Agency and Casting, run by Rachel Chandler (frequent Lolita Express flier).

       I've explained this about ten times but sure, I'll do it again.

       It's a very random, very difficult to find website unless you know what you're looking for.  Then, it's even harder to recognize the message below, which can be confirmed only by downloading it and getting the "hellofriend.svg".  Then you see it's legitimate, you translate it, run it through and when you get the MCCANN result you know the source is not compromised.  That's probably the end of this chain, and there's a signal either told in the instructions or it's somewhere we're not able to decode in the webpage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, the whole idea is that this is a
       <strong>
        DEAD DROP
       </strong>
       .  It's a coded message, probably just saying "you're on the right way".  If that code were to come back either only gibberish or return a result that was NOT Mccan then they'd know it was compromised or just moved somewhere else.

         It's just espionage man.  You hide in plain sight, we don't know all the signal phrases they use.  Here's a totally baseless idea of how you can end up here.
        </p>
        <p>
         See Besta Pizza has the symbol, know that the code to identify as a pedo is chicken lover.  Call up Besta Pizza, say you'd like to order a large Chicken lover pizza (not something you would order normally, right?).  The guy says hang on, takes your information then mails you instructions including the cipher and how to find the deaddrop.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is textbook espionage and is fraught with hidden angles and missing links.

          In this case, they propably reorganised already and are using places owned by people not connected to those mentioned in any way (or at least hidden). I hope FBI or autists find the connection, so they don't find dead end.

        Of course the thing you found is called "hellofriend" dot whatever, thats a reference to critically admired TV Show Mr Robot, famous for its cryptographic easter eggs. I would literally bet reddit gold the person who cracked this website and inserted this bullshit meaningless stuff is actually reading this and laughing at you so hard right now

    From what I saw yesterday.. did they make any progress on the hellofriends.svg page? I know the code on the page was ciphered and it read "mention 'cant remember' for discount". I fell asleep after they determined that to be true. So I'm wondering if it lead anywhere else besides that? Like webpage or what not.
   </p>
   <p>
    I know they started looking into the people behind said website, and it linked to a guy in Georga and DC, but I'm not sure anything beyond that.
Fell asleep after the spiderman memes ha.

     How are they tying this to the 698 tho? Where did that come from?

      I thought it was two separate codes, I now think it is the same picture as the one used to create the 698. I think 698 comes from converting all the letters obtained when deciphered into numbers, and then adding or obtaining their "value".

       Exactly.. A=1, B=2, C=3... ..Z=26. 
You take "nqeuhpeyfhmmplqquupgqoqhtqckhyopweupexpwgbhgyumhll" and add it all up = 698.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like all the other sentences on that screenshot and over 9000 random sentences with similar length. It doesn't mean anything and you could come up with many sentences of similar length about whatever you choose to also yield 698 with this method. People are being trolled by 4chan and don't understand what this is (also see my other comment in this thread for details about the other cipher etc). ~~I'm actually inclined to *ask /r/theydidthemath about the chances of a match based on letter frequencies in english sentences, but i don't really know how to formulate the question in a meaningful way.~~

        Isn't there another way to think about this (admittedly simple but a bit intuitive to get an approximation). The lowest total would be 50 (all letter A). The highest total would be 1300 (all z). The delta is 1250, meaning that the chance of a randomly constructed 50-letter phrase having a match is 1 in 1250, which is .08%? Since the language is not randomly constructed (lower probabilities of letters Q, X, Z...), the universe of possible phrases is actually much, much smaller. You could apply the letter probability to quickly refine (I am not bothering), which would quickly bring the chance of a likely collision to something over 1%. Thoughts? As to opinion of what to think of the link to https://www.z-sec.io/ and possible relevance, I think it is premature to judge. Godspeed to those on the hunt for truth and justice!

         That logic makes sense to me*. I also guess it would be somewhere around 2%. 
Plus there are many more sentences that could be constructed with the same or a similar message or with the exact opposite meaning or whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
         Edit: *i think you would need the average, not the delta

         About z-sec io. Yesterday their team appeared in this sub to give an AMA where they answered questions and explained what the message was (an xkcd reference) and how it can be decoded. They didn't know anything about gematria of course, why would they. Any word or sentence can be converted into a number and then be compared to other words and sentences that calculate to the same number when the same method is applied to it. Doing this had a good reason in languages with letters that were also used as numbers depending on context. Roman numbers would be a bad example for this, because you can easily see that MCCCXXXVII wouldn't actually be a word. Appart from that, modern gematria is mostly used for occult-showerthoughting and for half-life-3-confirming.

          People still looking into this should read the whole thread, including the path that it created (https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dgtcn/hi_reddit_were_the_zsecio_team/), and realize this was set up as a distraction. There is deliberate misdirection throughout, and the narrative starts to break down when you look at it from start to finish. None of us would have ever found this site without the misdirection. They were trying to lead us here.

          The IT company has an image of a long string of pigpen symbols at the bottom of their page, and apparently the same image in a directory on their server called hellofriends.svg.
         </p>
         <p>
          People just realized what the symbols were, and starting converting them.
         </p>
         <p>
          IMO it's a prank or disinfo (check out the about page on the IT site, the bios of the people working there are hilariously funny -one guy was raised by penguins in Antarctica apparently-), but who knows.

     Keep in mind it also has a hidden page entitled hellofriends.svg which is another code that when deciphered, is a coupon to god knows what.

     ITT, people have been trolled by 4chan.
    </p>
    <p>
     The code is
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigpen_cipher">
      Pigpen_cipher
     </a>
     I didn't see if this is true, but according to 4chan, the string is "nqeuhpeyfhmmplqquupgqoqhtqckhyopweupexpwgbhgyumhll"
It may be another cypher encoding whatever (i guess something like we're hiring blah blah...). A simple rot doesn't reveal anything (note the many double letters.. ..qquu..).
    </p>
    <p>
     Anyways, my point is that the gematria doesn't mean anything. 
First of all, despite being top at google, gematrix.org is a shitty site for this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Simple English Gematria means, that every letter is substituted with a number. A=1, B=2, C=3... ..Z=26.
If you add all of them up, it adds to 689, like all the other sentences on the sceenshot, that i guess, were entered by other users of the site. It's just an arbitrary sentence with about the same lenght. I don't feel like actually doing the math, but the odds of such long strings yielding the same number are not small at all. And you could contruct similar sentences to cover other numbers (TWO ZERO ZERO SEVEN, really?). This is also why Simple English Gematria should generally be considered a very crappy system of gematria and should never be used with anything longer than a few characters.

      Yeah I had no idea what pigpen_cipher or gematria were, but the whole thing felt fake.  It followed the exact same path as the alleged stegged owl photo.  People keep boarding these hype trains because they are not tech savvy enough to see the holes in the methods (myself included on this).

        From Google Cache and Yahoo Cache the web page was changed between the 6th of Nov. and the 13th of Nov.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was quite an operation then to fool someone later on the 15th of November.

        4chan must have been on to something to lead them away with these fake codes and fake leads.

     2007: is the year Madeleine went missing.
698: is the simple gematria value of the code that is at the bottom of the IT website.
    </p>
    <p>
     698 can also be the gematria value of other phrases which is worth looking into just in case they have a possible connection.

      but why is this important? 
did it predict it or simply annotate that news with that gematria value?
or was it even done many years in advance?
or is it simply the fact that its there thats creppy?
sorry if being stupid. 
there did seem to be loads of links/stories there

       don't be sorry man. I'm in the same boat you are. i didn't even know about gematria values until today. still trying to figure out how links are tied to gematria values. BUT whatever the reason is, it still is a WTF moment. Too much of a coincidence if you ask me.

      yes but that doesnt mean anything if this website was made in like 2010. All that would mean is they simply coded a known fact?
     </p>
     <p>
      unless theres something im missing? i havent looked thoroughly 100% into the other "articles" on that pic, but is it only freaky cos its Maddy? ie its out of context story saved there?

    There's a big stack of 698s in the source, one of which is underlined.  Why is that one underlined in particular?

     Because Mccan's investigation was never solved, and the Podesta bros were in Portugal at the time, their faces match the police sketches, there is some serious fucking interference from the British government in that investigation, and John's emails around that time are wiped.

      Thanks for the info.  Has it been established that they were in Portugal at the time?  I couldn't dig that up myself, and I've seen others asking the question.  It'd be nice to know for sure.

      Do we know for a fact the Podestas were in Portugal in 2007?

       Ahh I can't find it now one of the anon's found an email from 2007 indicating the Podestas were in Europe, and together and there are something to corroborate Portugal but I can't find the archive now.

        No. The email from 2014 indicates just one went to Portugal.

          Despite all the talk of "it was in the Wikileaks email!", the fact is that nobody can place John Podesta, Tony Podesta, or any Podesta in Portugal in 2007.

        This is a site I found that places both Podestas in the same complex as Madeleine at the time of the abduction, staying with Clem Freud, a convicted pedophile: http://victuruslibertas.com/2016/11/do-john-and-tony-podesta-have-a-connection-with-missing-child-madeleine-mccann/
It is anonymously sourced. There was a CFR meeting in Lisbon, Portugal May 3-5, 2007. See if anyone can find hard evidence.

         So a dude who is closely tied with the Podestas own a villa less than a mile from where Mccan was abducted... suspicious as fuck.

    This website has only one webachive entry and its created today https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.z-sec.io/
   </p>
   <p>
    It could be that somebody thought up a link to create and some ways to encrypt it as a puzzle and created a quick webpage.

   <p>
    Find evidence that the website existed over 2 weeks ago and it might be interesting

     Archive was created that day.* Doesn't mean it's a troll, means that someone archived it when they found it to be relevant.
    </p>
    <p>
     I believe it's registered for a year so it in theory should have been created a year before the expiration date.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you agree or are not trying to troll fix the first line. People will see this and discredit the post, when if it isn't a troll could lead to big things. It's important to get speculation, but labeling it a troll based on your opinion is hurtful if it isn't a troll.

       I think it has a high possibility to be a troll or disinformation.. what are the chances their intent was to imply themselves directly with an open investigation. Just doesn't add up to me. I think we should go back to see if it could possibly mean anything else.. just to eliminate any possible intent behind this. If none are found.. I would lean towards disinfo or these people are incredibly dumb.. but why go to those lengths to display that specific message? Ugh ima take a break from pizza gate my head hurts.

            I am not referencing any hidden gem.  Every time 4chan has claimed they found a hidden file in the podesta emails, or now on a semi-related site through a cipher, it has been an outright fabrication.  Outside of the creepy language in the body of the emails themselves, the gross social media accounts, and the connections between people and businesses nothing "hidden" has been uncovered to my knowledge.

             Ahhhhh okay. Yes lots of links to obscure references. Gotta be happy they're at least trying to keep alive. I remember such claims now to think about it. I think 4chan was most vocal about wanting it released. But lots of speculation in wikileaks insurance/dead man's switch files, which I believe to contain that hidden gem.. FBIanon seemed pretty authentic but once again on 4chan so no way to verify.

        It might be a troll, but there may be some misconceptions here too. Web Archive is an automatic crawler. If it's about an obscure, buried website that hasn't to some extent been hyperlinked to, there's nothing extraordinary about it not having been archived until people started linking to it. It's not manually archived but crawled.
       </p>
       <p>
        With Havre being the registering agent, this is still an open lead.

     The css file https://www.z-sec.io/css/custom.css shows the developer made a font-pack (just for the main logo, all other glyphs are a stock serif font), and updated it on 08/01/2016. line 368
     <code>
      /* Generated by Glyphter (http://www.glyphter.com) on  Mon Aug 01 2016*/
     </code>
    </p>
    <p>
     Also, They are using FontAwesome icon font-pack version 4.7.0 released on October 24th, 2016
https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases
    </p>
    <p>
     On the fence about it being a troll. The developer is pretty sharp but it could be an out of the box theme/template.
edit: The footer clearly says it's a template from Templated https://templated.co/

      Damn now thats some good digging.

     <p>
      A skeptic might say that anyone could edit that text file to be at any date; but if this was a quick prank then I don't think they would have noticed it. But then again: you did, so maybe they could have.

      I think you might be onto something.

     <p>
      I dont have the time to look into this right now but I hope others continue down your thread. If definitive proof is found that this was there 2 weeks ago then it would really be groundbreaking and worthy of this entire sub's attention.

    ALRIGHT EVERYONE:
   </p>
   <p>
    Zanarkand LLC's FCC listing:
http://apps.fcc.gov/cgb/form499/499detail.cfm?FilerNum=831666
   </p>
   <p>
    This is the address listed for the office of the Zanarkand LLC. On google maps it takes you to the backside of a Dentists Office??? What in the world???
3588 GA-138 #349 Stockbridge, GA 30281
   </p>
   <p>
    On the FCC website, and this could be entirely coincidence, Conneticut Ave is a big street in DC, but the agent who filed this claim for Zanarkand has an office in a building 15 minutes away from Comet Ping Pong:
http://apps.fcc.gov/cgb/form499/499detail.cfm?FilerNum=831666
   </p>
   <p>
    1150 Connecticut Ave, NW Suite 900
   </p>
   <p>
    Also worth noting the "D.C. Agent for Service of Process" Bill Havre is not listed on the Martin F McMahan &amp; Associates website. The Martin F McMahan also only has 2 google reviews, both 1 star and negative, and recent. This is a company that has been around since 1978???? Extremely weird.
   </p>
   <p>
    Working on this right now will update. Could be nothing.

     i find it strange that the suite number for the listed address is 349, exactly half of the 698 that was decoded. i'm not sure why but it just feels off, especially because of the odd location. maybe the numbers are important?

       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Bryan is a certified pentester and doomsayer for Zanarkand. He grew up on the southern tip of Antarctica and was raised by penguins. A kindly sea captain picked him up when he turned fourteen; upon returning to port, the sea captain promptly retired and married Bryan, and they have been together ever since.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        And this one:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Jane is VP of Customer Relations for Zanarkand. Trained as a cryptozoologist, Jane gained acclaim from an early age for discovering definitive proof of the existence of the Jersey Devil. Shortly afterwards, however, she realized man was the strangest animal of them all and left the field.

       if it was a PO box (at least a legitimate one) the address would start with P.O. Box #### Stockbridge, GA 30281. So I'm guessing it's not a po box address.

      Probably nothing but I recall that when the Feds searched the mansion of billionaire/convicted pedo Jeffrey Epstein, he had a fully functioning dentist chair complete with all equipment in a small room upstairs. Just weird. There's video and pics of it on reddit somewhere.

     The website link to the transactions group (from this page: http://www.martinmcmahonlaw.com/bios-2) has changed, based on archive.org, not only in what is on it but where it directs you. Now it points to this spot (http://www.tbacreative.net/bios.html) and displays a blank page with Chinese characters. It was showing in native Chinese until I translated. Does this have significance?? I have a theory.

     Bill Havre is not listed in the actual link as being with McMahon &amp; Associates, just showing their DC address. Here is the link to his company, https://www.registeredagentsinc.com, not showing any DC office. Even more important, the first archive.org capture is November 8. This whole ruse is a setup and a shill/troll venture to misinform, create more lunatic-sounding conspiracy, and take us off the hot scent. Those sniffing this lead should be applauded for exploring all unturned stones, but this should be seen as a conclusive misinformation thread at this point.

    Clearly somebody is messing around at this point.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Andrew
    </li>
    <li>
     Andrew is a certified pentester and VP of R&amp;D for Zanarkand. He was born in 1923 on the river Seine and, thanks to a rather nice gypsy woman, stopped aging at 29. He is also a consummate truth-teller and seer, and often accomplishes his pentests in record time thanks to his supernatural abilities.
    </li>
    <li>
     Broddie
    </li>
    <li>
     Broddie is a certified pentester and President of Zanarkand. He is a local boy, and lived on a vast country estate for the first seven years of his life. After an unfortunate meeting with a wampus kitty, Broddie left his family and estate and became a hobo with one mission: to hack into the Parks Department servers and find that damn wampus kitty.
    </li>
    <li>
     Bryan
    </li>
    <li>
     Bryan is a certified pentester and doomsayer for Zanarkand. He grew up on the southern tip of Antarctica and was raised by penguins. A kindly sea captain picked him up when he turned fourteen; upon returning to port, the sea captain promptly retired and married Bryan, and they have been together ever since.
    </li>
    <li>
     Darlene
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Darlene is VP of Accounting for Zanarkand. She obtained her doctorate in Aboriginal Studies from the University of Western Australia, but then realized that her true passion was making sure numbers in two columns matched and left Australia to pursue her numerical dreams.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Hank
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     Hank is VP of Sales and Marketing for Zanarkand. Not much else is known about Hank, although if you ask him where he came from, he will stare off into space for about 6 minutes before slowly responding that the universe is dying, and his people need him. This is generally followed by a quiet cough and a swig from his hip flask.
    </li>
    <li>
     Jane
    </li>
    <li>
     Jane is VP of Customer Relations for Zanarkand. Trained as a cryptozoologist, Jane gained acclaim from an early age for discovering definitive proof of the existence of the Jersey Devil. Shortly afterwards, however, she realized man was the strangest animal of them all and left the field.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    In addition, Zanarkand is a Final Fantasy location.. http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Zanarkand

     Speculation as to what a part of this could mean isn't going to lead us anywhere. (Didn't scroll down to 698) but if you feel it's a lead, post what you've found within your link in your OP, so effort isn't wasted to see if it's relevant or not.

        Would need help at the FCC to create that fake date when created this month. This thing goes very deep, but they are trying to distract with rabbit holes.

       Whoever wants to know who is behind pizzagate and is covering up this whole conspiracy the answer is in the 4 letter archive.is second link.
      </p>
      <p>
       The odds of THAT happening are astronomical.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole reality matrix must be a fake.

        Or the chaos of reality is trying to send us messages. That would explain the gematria actually linking to something relevant, within the first 10 sentences that have the same sum.
       </p>
       <p>
        All this attention given to this case is causing more and more "random" links like this to be found, and taken as evidence, causing more and more attention to be given to the links... etc

     A yahoo cache of November 6th reveals that the webpage should have the images above viewing the page source.
    </p>
    <p>
     But only hellofreind.svg remains in the current page.
    </p>
    <p>
     And firefox is now warning the page is a forgery.
    </p>
    <p>
     It looks like the entire setup of the webpage changed in the last week.

    Sorry guys - someone is pulling our leg. Look around the
    <a href="https://www.z-sec.io/index.html">
     website
    </a>
    OP is talking about. If you are paranoid, you can run it through
    <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/">
     VirusTotal
    </a>
    to verify the website is safe.*
   </p>
   <p>
    A few things to note - they realize the "mysterious symbols" are there, as they mention it on their FAQ. You'll also notice the question before the last mentions they track website visits - just be aware.
   </p>
   <p>
    Continue to the "About us" page and you'll notice most of the mini-bios are humorously fake.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you look at their Network Management Service, they include a link the a "pricing document" near the bottom of the page. This link leads to a 404.
   </p>
   <p>
    I haven't tried any of the info on the contact page, but looking up their phone number shows it is owned by a Zanarkand LLC, which according to
    <a href="https://www.bizapedia.com/ga/zanarkand-llc.html">
     bizapedia is a "Domestic Limited-Liability Company"
    </a>
    , not a private security firm.
   </p>
   <p>
    Also, while this doesn't say much, overall the website is pretty "weak". It's very simple and wouldn't take long to make, and certainly wouldn't sell me if I was a client looking to outsource my IT security.
   </p>
   <p>
    *A final note about the "safety" of this website - Chrome is blocking scripts from running when I visit this website. I doubt they are anything too bad since Chrome doesn't completely block access to the website and VirusTotal shows it's clean, but caution is always recommended.
   </p>
   <p>
    Basically, this looks like a prank.

     A "Limited-Liability Company" (LLC) doesn't dictate what they do, it's just the type of organization. I'm not saying the evidence in this thread is definitely legit, but none of the points you're making really discredit it.

    The stupidity of this post and this thread are going to make me lose it.  Literally billions of sentences could add up to 698 in gematria.  This is DISINFORMATION.  The only reason that sentence is near the top of the results is from people googling it in the wake of pizzagate.

     I agree. This is copied from above to put the probabilities in perspective:
Isn't there another way to think about this (admittedly simple but a bit intuitive to get an approximation). The lowest total would be 50 (all letter A). The highest total would be 1300 (all z). The delta is 1250, meaning that the chance of a randomly constructed 50-letter phrase having a match is 1 in 1250, which is .08%? Since the language is not randomly constructed (lower probabilities of letters Q, X, Z...), the universe of possible phrases is actually much, much smaller. You could apply the letter probability to quickly refine (I am not bothering), which would quickly bring the chance of a likely collision to something over 1%. Thoughts? Godspeed to those on the hunt for truth and justice!

    I did a whois on the on the z-sec.io IP address (217.70.184.38) and found that whole netblock is registered with ICANN. I wonder if this is why Obama was so adamant about giving ICANN over to the UN...
