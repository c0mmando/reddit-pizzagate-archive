<strong>If they are already covering their tracks what can we do?</strong>
<p><p>If they are changing their logos and deleting thing etc. That means they know people are looking into what they are doing? Are we too late? If the link to the DOJ is true, then is there any other law enforcement that could handle this? Would Interpol investigate this? </p></p>

<p><p>Don't worry about it... The FBI has this shit on lockdown. They might not let the public know the nature of any high profile arrests, but they are working on dismantling this. Hollywood and the media is wrapped up in the pizza stuff so they gotta tread carefully in how they handle it. </p></p>

<p><p>Agreed. There is a mountain of money available to fund legal defences so anything the FBI has needs to be not 100% solid but 1000% solid. They will likely act against the big rollers only when and if they have enough to take down a shit load at once and win every single court case.</p>
<p>Any pizza gate research that happens is beneficial to the FBI because it might indicate new leads to them or uncover evidence they may not otherwise have noticed. I'm sure a lot of the stuff 4chan is finding is definitely getting tagged for any possible inquests.</p></p>

<p><p>1) get the current, and most suspicious / convincing info and make it presentable to the public.</p>
<p>2) Raise awareness in a non-crazy / tin foil hat kind of way.</p>
<p>There's no real evidence or concrete proof any of this is true, so it's not like the FBI will come in and arrests people.</p>
<p>The best thing to do is let people know, get people talking about it, which will increase the chances of any official investigation into it.</p></p>

<p><p>Contact local authorities who are less likely to be compromised and at least shut some places down and put them on the defensive.</p></p>

<p><p>The super elites are spearheading this whole thing. Don't think that they aren't going down without a fight. The reprucussions of exposing them is scary.</p></p>

<p><p>Assume every level of law enforcement is compromised in this.</p>
<p>-
I would suggest not contacting them with any details and implicating yourself in any attempt to uncover this. People have very likely died as a result of trying to keep this secret. I have several leads I'm looking into right now where people appear to have been killed in times of exposure.</p>
<p>-
Expose publicly from the shadows.</p></p>
