        <strong>Any way to get teachers involved?</strong>
        <p><p>The girl from that video that appeared to be from the late 80s or early 90s (sorry I can bring myself to rewatch to get more specifics ðŸ˜“) said that she was still going to school throughout all of hay horrendous stuff. She thought it was "normal" so never said anything. </p>
<p>I wonder if there would be a way for teachers/ school counselor etc to reach out to the students to see if any of them would come forward.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they have probably seen what happens to those who doðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“. At best are not believed. There would have to be a trusted task force or something to help any child that does come forward.</p></p>

        <p><p>Related thought- what about any psychologists or psychiatrists that have worked with patients and maybe didn't believe that what their clients were describing was literal and real.</p>
<p>Or clergy that have counseled people coming from this and thought they were just dealing with an internal, spiritual battle.</p>
<p>We are going to need survivors to come forward to fill in the blanks.How do we find them and how do we make sure they're taken seriously?</p></p>

        <p><p>Well, by law teachers are required to report anything suspicious or pointing to abuse. They can be fired and face charges if they don't report it.</p>
<p>But the teacher can't press issues like this without reason. Honestly if I started asking students if they ever were made to do xyz I'd be fired and blacklisted from ever teaching lmao</p></p>
