        <p><p>Art school drop-out here.
Koons is in the top 5 most wealthy living artists in the world.
Since the time of Pollock and Rothko (or anything POST WWII (post-expressionism) - Entartete Kunst/"Degenerate Art"), art has successfully been a way for the rich to launder money and nothing else.</p>
<p>Wiki of Koons:
Koons is a member of the Board of Directors of the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (ICMEC), a global nonprofit organization that combats child sexual exploitation, child pornography, and child abduction.[129] In 2007, Koons, along with his wife Justine, founded the ICMEC Koons Family Institute on International Law and Policy.[130] It is the International Centre's research arm.[131][132][133][130]</p>
<p>As highlighted by articles over the years, including a Wall Street Journal article entitled "Pooling Resources to Fight Child Abuse and Abduction", the issue of child abduction is personal to Koons.[133][134] Following the end of his marriage to Hungarian-born Italian porn actress Staller in 1994, as she wanted to continue to perform as a porn actress and Koons wanted them to be monogamous, Staller, in violation of a US court order, left with their then-two-year-old son, Ludwig and took the child to Italy.[132][133][135] After Koons spent millions of dollars in legal fees over a five-year period pursuing parental rights to his young son, the Italian Supreme Court failed to recognize the couples' US-based joint custody agreement and instead sided with Staller.[133][134][136]</p>
<p>This loss for Koons led him to establish the Koons Family Institute, and devote over $4.3 million to the International Centre’s work.[134][136] In addition, Koons’ 2010 partnership with Kiehl's to design the artwork for a limited edition moisturizer line raised $200,000 for the Koons Family Institute.[130][134][137]</p>
<p>Highly suspect if you ask me; as we all know ANY non-profit regarding children is suspect AF.
While Koons may not be part, his patrons certainly may be...</p></p>

        <p><p>I think the close connections to Gagosian, Qatar and Joannue are too suspect. I really think these Greek shipping magnates are a big part </p></p>
