    A Blow-By-Blow, In-Depth Factcheck of the New York Times PizzaGate Story. [MASTER THREAD]
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    [EDIT: Quentin Hardy, the Assistant Tech Editor of the NY Times, who supposedly gets paid to do the job I/we generously did for him in this post, changed his Twitter Avi to a Pizza Hut sign after this article was published yesterday. 
https://twitter.com/qhardy/status/800884090060668928
Let him know that /r/pizzagate appreciates his quality journalism!]
   </p>
   <p>
    The purpose of this thread is to pick apart the litany of factual errors, mischaracterizations, and fallacies that appeared in Cecilia Kang's article, "Fact Check: This Pizzeria Is Not A Child Trafficking Site" (New York Times, Nov. 21, 2016). 
Here's a link: http://archive.is/Nwn5e
   </p>
   <p>
    Please do not post wild speculation and RUMINT in this thread. The goal here is to build an objective case that the editorial staff of the NY Times is guilty of some of the very same "fake news" tactics it's currently decrying. I'm going to list every factually problematic excerpt I found. Feel free to add any other errors below.
   </p>
   <p>
    1) "All of them alleged something that made Mr. Alefantis’s jaw drop: that Comet Ping Pong was the home base of a child abuse ring led by Hillary Clinton and her campaign chief, John D. Podesta."
   </p>
   <p>
    STRAW-MAN ARGUMENT: Kang claims (no sources sited) that online investigators allege that the child abuse ring is "led by Hillary Clinton and John D. Podesta". I've seen hundreds of threads on reddit and 4/8chan, and I've seen very few people push the argument,  that HRC and John Podesta are the "leaders" of anything. The vast majority of speculation so far has asserted that HRC and the Podestas are INVOLVED in a child abuse ring. This may seem like quibbling over semantics but to the normal NYT reader, "led by" is a far more extreme - and unbelievable - allegation than "involved in". Right off the bat, Kang insinuates without any evidence or quotes that the entire open-source investigation sound like a mob of hyperbolic, delusional conspiracy theorists.
   </p>
   <p>
    2) "He [Alefantis] found dozens of made-up articles about Mrs. Clinton kidnapping, molesting and trafficking children in the restaurant's back rooms. The articles appeared on Facebook and on websites such as The New Nationalist and The Vigilant Citizen, with one headline blaring: "Pizzagate: How 4Chan Uncovered the sick World of Washington's Occult Elite. None of it was true."
   </p>
   <p>
    STRAW-MAN: Kang's use of sources in this passage is evasive, and also scrambles the chronology of events in the #Pizzagate scandal. When she mentions "dozens of made-up articles", she provides no specific examples or hyperlinks. Furthermore, she goes on to imply that ALL of these articles
    <em>
     specifically identify Hillary Clinton
    </em>
    as the individual who is going around personally kidnapping children. Any sane person would doubt such a story - but of course, that's not what the vast aggregate of investigators is claiming at all. Once again, Kang appears to be deliberately exaggerating and over-simplifying the allegations of Pizzagate in order to make its propagators look
    <em>
     unserious
    </em>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    MISLEADING BY OMISSION: Throughout the entire piece, Kang brings up ZERO historical examples of proven underage sex-trafficking rings that served (and were protected by) a network of rich and powerful elites. While neglecting to mention the Franklin Scandal, the Praesidio Scandal, or the Finders is not surprising (all three stories have been largely ignored by the NYT for decades), it
    <em>
     is
    </em>
    surprising that no mention is made of confirmed pedophile scandals tied to the Catholic Church (
    <em>
     Spotlight
    </em>
    won Best Picture last year ffs!), BBC host Jimmy Savile, or Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky. There is also no mention of the Hollywood pedophilia ring allegations that have grabbed major headlines in the US over the past several years. By omitting all of these historical events and the completely justifiable public interest they have generated online, Kang provides no context for what motivates Pizzagate investigators beyond paranoia and a deep but vague gullibility to "fake news".
   </p>
   <p>
    MISLEADING CHRONOLOGY: Kang commits a sleight-of-hand when she reports that Alefantis "looked online to unravel the accusations" right after he and his staff started receiving hate messages. Comet Ping Pong was first stumbled upon in the wee hours of November 4th. Alefantis' instagram and Facebook accounts started getting threatening messages within hours from overzealous idiots on 4chan.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Vigilant Citizen article that Kang cites was posted on November 15th, ELEVEN DAYS after Alefantis was first "exposed" on 4chan and reddit. Thus, there's no way that Alefantis did a quick google search on November 4th and found the VC article.
   </p>
   <p>
    If Kang had done a simple google search, she would've seen that on November 6th (within 48 hours of exposure), Washington City Paper published "Alt Right Conspiracy Theorists Obsess Over Comet Ping Pong", featuring interviews with "Pizza Party Ben" and James Alefantis: http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/food/blog/20840980/alt-right-conspiracy-theorists-obsess-over-comet-ping-pong
   </p>
   <p>
    ^ Though the tone of this article is skeptical, it at least mentions Jeffrey Epstein, Correct the Record, and the potential use of "pizza" as a codeword for child sex in the Podesta Emails. The NYT article mentions none of these things, and their absence further warps the narrative to make pizzagate investigators look insane.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her scrambling of the chronology helps morph the narrative so that it reinforces the "Fake News" meme currently being spread by the establishment media. This argument is what's fake. #PizzaGate did not spring out of "fake news", but social media forums.
   </p>
   <p>
    3) "Mr. Alefantis’s experience shows it is not just politicians and internet companies that are grappling with the fake news fallout. He, his staff and friends have become a new kind of private citizen bull’s-eye for the purveyors of false articles and their believers. For more than two weeks, they have struggled to deal with the abusive social media comments and to protect photos of their own children, which were used in the false articles as evidence that the pizza restaurant was running a pedophilia ring."
   </p>
   <p>
    MISCHARACTERIZATION/NO EVIDENCE: James Alefantis has no children. Most of the other Comet employees on instagram who post disturbing content (workinonmahnightcheese, Amanda Kleinman, and others) do not have children either. Furthermore, the evidence from instagram was not initially obtained or spread via "false news articles" but posted directly on 4/8chan and Reddit forums by a variety of anonymous users. It's interesting that Kang doesn't provide a links or screenshot of the many sexually suggestive and/or ultraviolent instagram pictures that were found on the accounts of Alefantis and his employees. I can fully understand not linking to any of the pictures featuring children (legal/ethical issues galore), but what about the other disturbing photos that feature overtly bizarre sexual/violent content? Did Kang not see the child coffin, the stacks of Euros and date rape drugs, the #killroom? Once again, the NYT Reader is expected to simply take Kang's word for it, and is given no opportunity to examine any of the "evidence" for themselves.
   </p>
   <p>
    4) "The eatery, which seats 120, is a mash-up of red and white checkered tablecloths and modernist murals and paintings from friends of Mr. Alefantis."
   </p>
   <p>
    MISCHARACTERIZATION BY OMISSION: Kang gives no description of what those "modernist" murals and paintings are. Most NYT readers have no objection to modernist murals - who would? But if she did describe them, she would have to acknowledge that one of the murals features happy, loving adults cradling severed heads. Further research verified that the painter of the mural has multiple works featuring people cradling severed heads: 
source: https://chemtrailsevilla.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/img_0770-e1479229991485.jpg?w=604&amp;h=451
here's another painting by same artist: http://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1478/22/1478224865340.jpg
   </p>
   <p>
    But to Kang, the adjective "modernist" suffices. This is deliberately misleading. Nobody is saying that these paintings "prove" anything, but why go out of your way to describe them as benign and "modernist"?
   </p>
   <p>
    5) "Days before the election, users on the online message board 4chan noticed that one of Mr. Podesta's emails contained communications with Mr. Alefantis discussing a fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton. The 4Chan users immediately speculated about the links between Comet Ping Pong and the Democratic Party. Some posited the restaurant was part of a larger Democratic child trafficking ring, which was a theory long held by some conservative blogs."
   </p>
   <p>
    OVERSIMPLIFICATION, NO SOURCES CITED: 4chan was the first to discover weird references to "pizza" in Podesta's emails. That led to someone suggesting that "pizza" was a codeword for either child porn or children. However, that was preceded by a reddit post that was retweeted by Wikileaks about Hillary Clinton's connection to Laura Silsby, an American woman arrested for attempted child trafficking in Haiti. (Haiti is mentioned zero times in this article, despite it being one of the strongest leads to come out of #PizzaGate.)
   </p>
   <p>
    Keep in mind (because Kang doesn't) that all this was also happening against the backdrop of the #SpiritCooking revelations, as well as several CIA-linked public figures (Steve Pieczenik, Erik Prince) telling alternative rightwing media outlets (Breitbart, Infowars) that the evidence found on Anthony Weiner's computer related, in part, to child trafficking networks and horrible sex crimes against children. It's unclear if these are the news sites Kang is referring to when she constantly mentions "Fake News", but the fact that she never clarifies the matter is problematic.
   </p>
   <p>
    Whether one believes these sources or not, several shadowy insiders
    <em>
     were
    </em>
    publicly leaking (supposedly accurate) intel about Clinton ties to human trafficking that just so happened to line up with 4chan and Reddit stumbling upon "Spirit Cooking" and "Pizza" in the Wikileaks emails. (Come to think of it, there's not one mention of "Spirit Cooking" in this entire piece, even though it was another one of the catalyzing incidents that led directly to Pizzagate - #SpiritCooking even trended on Twitter in the final week of the election.)
   </p>
   <p>
    6) "Glen Caplin, a former campaign official for Mrs. Clinton, did not comment directly about Comet Ping Pong but said, “WikiLeaks has spawned several conspiracy theories that have been independently debunked.” Mr. Podesta did not respond to requests for comment."
   </p>
   <p>
    NO EVIDENCE/APPEAL TO AUTHORITY: Kang doesn't elaborate on Caplin's vague claim that "several conspiracy theories" from Wikileaks have been "independently debunked". No evidence is provided, and no follow-up questions are asked, but for the record, no one has successfully challenged the authenticity of the emails that Wikileaks has released thus far. Once again, the reader is simply expected to take a Clinton campaign spokesperson at their (brief, evasive) word.
   </p>
   <p>
    7) "Most troubling for Mr. Alefantis and staff has been the use of children’s images, pilfered from the restaurant’s social media pages and the personal accounts of friends who had “liked” Comet Ping Pong online. Those photos have been used across dozens of websites. Parents, who declined to talk publicly for fear of retribution, have hired lawyers to get the photos removed."
   </p>
   <p>
    MISLEADING LANGUAGE: Kang makes it sound like pizzagaters took pictures of children off of Comet Pizza's official pages, and off random people who merely "liked" official Comet Ping Pong posts. This is false. The vast majority of the disturbing images were "pilfered" from James Alefantis's personal, public Instagram account. The others were from several accounts of his employees and associates, all of whom do
    <em>
     not
    </em>
    have children of their own. 
The "Parents, who declined to talk publicly for fear of retribution..." don't bother to give even an anonymous quote. Who are they? Surprisingly, nobody has figured it out. I recall at least 5 different infants and children on James' instagram alone. None of the supposed "parents" of the pictured children have - as of now, Nov. 22 - been identified via social media research.
   </p>
   <p>
    Kang is correct that 4chan users searched through the accounts of everyone who "liked" those creepy baby photographs - but they didn't find a single parent. Instead, they found Assistant US Attorney Arun G. Rao, whose jurisdiction in southern Maryland covers child pornography and racketeering cases. Funny how that didn't make it in.
   </p>
   <p>
    I could pick apart more but I'm fading fast. It should be clear to all by this point that the establishment media is not here to defend you from the scourge of "Fake News".

           I can't trust you. U just ruined your credibility by using a common phrase. I'm not even sure you're even an atheist.

          Doesn't matter, we need to keep the religious angle out of this while reporting on Satanic rituals. If we make this appear as a religious argument instead of documentation, we lost the argument and fail to convince people. I was involved in tracking down people in pizzagate, but I dropped out of the chats due to people quoting the bible at me. They studied it less than I have and it just doesn't belong here. I'm sick of the "Jesus Saves" or apocalypse end times discussions detracting from the collection and presentation of facts.

       Kanye never mentioned PizzaGate and apprently James Alefantis is his birth name (Haven't seen the evidence of this one either way yet.)

        Why is it impossible to have a discussion without being aggressive?
       </p>
       <p>
        Now who registered the domain name mybestapizza.com? Right, you don't know because you got in retarded mode before doing any actual research. I will guide you by the hand poor ignorant:
       </p>
       <p>
        Go to http://www.whois.com/ and do a search for my mybestapizza.com. The registrant name is Ibrahima Diallo from Maryland. People googled his name and found this guy: http://iamafricanandican.blogspot.ca/2014/05/ibrahima-diallo.html
       </p>
       <p>
        Well it turns out that there's a guy named Ibrahima Diallo who lives in Maryland and who's a web developer.
       </p>
       <p>
        So who do you think of being the domain registrant? A guy in Haiti who's address doesn't match or a web developer from Maryland who's city matches the registrant record?
       </p>
       <p>
        And why the mention about Kanye and Alefantis? All I was referring is the part about the mybestapizza.com domain (which I quoted in my post).
       </p>

      Adam's Morgan has 3 pizza places all less than a block from each other. U St has 3 pizza places about a block from each other. It's pizza...majority of the population loves pizza. Nothing weird about it being close to another pizza place. NYC there are pizza places everywhere...oh no that's weird.

         that's not the same product. it would be dumb to pay the expenses of two locations if one is taking business from the other and vice versa. unless you're operating at completely maximum capacity.

      I thought the attorney for besta pizza was a real estate lawyer with the same name as the doj attorney? Did we ever get to the bottom of that?

      Also, if you had it called to your attention that your logo is utilizing MBL symbols, you'd probably be pretty quick to rectify the problems. At the same time, the logo does look like a perfect fucking match to the one shown in the FBI database. This investigation is getting twisted and hard to follow.

        False as shown by the other comment, it's a Web developer and many/ most small business' hire out to do websites.

        Because according to this sub it was a secret symbol, aka not known to the general public, and it's a pizza place. Coincidence, as for why they took it down, they found out it was a symbol for pedophilia, so obviously they don't want to be associated with that.
       </p>

      <li>
       <p>
        Pizza is the most popular food in the country, Washington DC is a big city.

         No, that's not what I said. The points presented are delusional. They are not evidence that something is going on. There is better evidence that something is going on.

          It's like looking into a fire. If you do it for too long, things become warped.

          People are focusing on all the same shit over and over and it's distorting the information in plain sight.

       Well Abramovic holding a bundle of sticks with "faggot" reference is using the old definition of faggot, a "bundle of sticks." That was the joke of the instagram comment.

     Seriously, the Instagram pics with the baby chewing on EURO bills, the guy with the necklace around him and the child, the kid taped to the table, the COUNTLESS explicit  depictions of pizza as genitalia, the "J'aime les enfants" shirt. All from the top of my head and I am no researcher...

     Yes. The Instagram posts were what got people thinking this whole thing was legitimate. The author makes the claim Alifantis never met Clinton, but how is that a serious claim when he was
     <em>
      dating David Brock
     </em>
     , in that GQ list, Obama was known to have held a fundraiser there, Podesta had been there, the evidence is simply too much.

      That is a serious claim that Alifantis never met Clinton.

      Wish we could disprove it and get the NYT to retract that statement.  Sure there's a photo out there somewhere.

       But there isn't. There's an e-mail with a note, and we know that Podesta held a fundraiser that Alefantis cooked at. I think it's weird that he may not have ever met her, but I also don't think it's outside of the realm of possibility at all. Fundraisers take place all over the country/world, the candidate can't be at all of them.

       I don't see the point of proving a connection to him and Hillsry. It just feeds into the narrative all of this is a vast rightwing conspiracy to bully Hill.

        Because we could cut off the head of the Democrat party over this and dominate politics for the next decade or two.  Plus, if they are guilty let's find out and prosecute the criminals.  Right?

         I don't like Hillary and think there is probably enough to pursue her for corruption concerning pay-to-play, but I genuinely don't see her as directly involved in anything concerning this story. These people don't seem like her crowd. They certainly seem like Podesta's crowd. That isn't a defense of her, but I think she socializes with higher tier corrupt people. The kind of corruption I see as her potential weakness seems more money and power related than sex related.

          She went to pedo island many times.   Bill was a frequent guest.  Hillary's a fan of the 'spirit cooking' artist.  She's right in the middle of all this.

        I'm by no means on a conquest to implicate her into this, just to bash her. It wouldn't surprise me, but I haven't found any direct conntion and it seems like there isn't going to be. We don't have to hurt her anymore, she's already done enough that's proven that she isn't a good person. Even with no evident connection, this will only stress the fact that she mingles with evil people and knows it. A lot.

     I keep sharing this because our core message is being lost. Keep pushing the narrative that started this. It's one of the strongest arguments we can make.

       Actually, no. Not really. these kind of crimes and cabals have been long simmering the underbelly of the world. Its amazing the crimes we forgive past leaders just because we labelled their victims 'slaves.'

      <p>
       The only strange thing is that we haven't noticed yet.

    The Kincora scandal in Belfast rarely gets mentioned, but it had connections to many power people and with British intelligence services. The many victims claim there was a cover up.
   </p>
   <p>
    https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kincora_Boys'_Home
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     The Kincora Boys' Home was a boys' home in Belfast, Northern Ireland that was the scene of
     <strong>
      serious organised child sexual abuse, causing a scandal and attempted cover-up in 1980, with credible allegations of state collusion.
     </strong>
     [1] The Northern Ireland Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry began examining allegations relating to the Home on 31 May 2016, including claims that there was a paedophile ring at the home with links to the
     <strong>
      intelligence services
     </strong>
     ; Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said that all state agencies would co-operate with the inquiry.[2]
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <hr/>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     The Belfast News Letter reported that files on Kincora were "conspicuously absent" from the routine January 2013 release of 1982 government papers by the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI) under the 30-year rule.[6]
    </p>
    <p>
     In July 2014 former military intelligence officer Colin Wallace said that any new investigation into the abuse at the home should have access to information from intelligence agencies.[16] Wallace said that he received intelligence in 1973 that boys at the home were being abused, but some of his superior officers refused to pass on information.[16] He also said that the Terry and Hughes inquiries did not examine evidence relating to the intelligence services.[16]
    </p>
    <p>
     In August 2014 another former intelligence officer, Brian Gemmell, said that he also had been ordered to stop investigating allegations of abuse at the home.[17] He said that he learned details of what happened in the home while gathering information on loyalists.[17] He was told he was running two agents who had close links to the home.[17] As well as telling him not to investigate, the senior officer told him to stop running an agent.[17] He had spoken out anonymously before, but dropped his anonymity because he wanted the allegations to be investigated again.[17]
    </p>
    <p>
     It was alleged that extreme Ulster loyalists who were members of a paedophile ring committing offences at the Home were being blackmailed by MI5 and other branches of the security forces during the Troubles. In 2015 campaigners were trying to have Kincora included in a wide-ranging inquiry to establish whether
     <strong>
      the security services prevented action on the abuse so they could compromise some of the perpetrators.
     </strong>

     Also in the 1950s in Republic of Ireland children born out of wedlock were taken and sold to rich American families. Sorry for any lack of links but just google Philomena. There is countless events in history which are similar to what is going on with Pizzagate yet people still completely throw the idea as ridiculous? People just don't want it to be true so they choose it be fake.

    Fortune Mag just repeated the same bullshit slant. It's all from a press release by Comet no doubt.

    They blame it on a single "fake news" story rather than the truth: that thousands of independent non-partisan citizen investigators have been working on it for over two weeks, and came to the same dark conclusion based on a mountian of evidence.

    The article got one thing right: "It's endless"

     And by chicken does she mean a literal chicken bird, or the pedo slang  chicken meaning male child.

     It looks to be a postcard of the Moloch Machine from the 1927 film
     <em>
      Metropolis
     </em>
     , like

    <p>
     This is an email from W. Lewis Anselem to Task Force Honduras, later forwarded to Clinton. If you give the whole sentence ("With fingers crossed, the old rabbit's foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . ."), it's obviously a humorous way of saying "hoping for good luck."

      So why does he have this postcard in what looks to be his pizza place? This doesnt help un-explain the narrative at all. It makes it worse IMO. Watch the video at 2:00.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can write off the occurrence of both moloch references as coincidence, yes. But you cant simply deny that its pretty creepy considering its emergence only occured due to a pedophilia related investigation.

     How is that harassment? These rags don't allow user comments on the page of the piece but then complain about getting feedback over their lies and misrepresentations through their social media. Why even publish their social media in the article? It's just a way for agenda driven "journalists" to misrepresent reality then play the victim card when it's pointed out.

    The article failed to provide its readers with any of the photos, likely because its author knows that readers would find them deeply troubling.

    The contents of it are indescribably bizarre and the contexts of the posts and comment chains are weird. Alefantis does not have any children nor do his closest associates, but the photos seem to be a near constant assortment of different children of a variety of ages, intermingled between posts about gay bars, clubs, photos of common rape drugs, and piles of foreign currency. After it being trawled through for 24 hours it has been set to private. A large set of archived copies can be seen here in the next section. Similarly the instagram and twitter accounts of Comet Ping Pong are being edited selectively. The accounts of the people favoriting and commenting on these posts are equally bizarre in both content, context, and demeanor.
   </p>
   <p>
    It seems that the NYT does not want its 8 or so readers to view the evidence and come to their own conclusions.

     This is how I have learned to read the media. And a lot of people who never heard of Pizzagate but are open to hear the information will see this article and make their own investigation like you just said. Ultimately this will only make us STRONGER.

    Can we look for connections of the DC pedo parties to Lawrence E. King? (aka Larry King, an African american).  He was the pedophile who ran the Franklin Credit Union in Omaha, NE, that became known as the 'Franklin Cover Up'. Just google it. A documentary was made 'Conspiracy of Silence' you can youtube and watch.
Now, Larry King went to jail for the funneling of 41 million to the contras, but the never charged in the child sex trafficking ring. They covered that up, as I fear they will again. Larry King got out of jail a few years ago, and people went to check/harass him. He got a job outside DC selling armored Mercedes cars. Cush job he recently left, as we continued to call and tell his coworkers. He is also said to be 'arranging parties' around DC. Find him and his connections to this. They have to be there. Larry King was a BIG player in republican politics. He sang the natl' anthem at the 84 and 88 republican conventions. He also hung out at parties at South Fork ranch. He's back in the biz. Read a write up from one of the kids interviewed during that scandal. Forgive the link wording, it has protected this doc for years!

    BTW there have been 3 articles about sexual abuse scandals on /r/soccer in the past week, 2 related to the former manager of a team called Crewe Alexandra who sexually abused some minors. There could be more but they get lost since the sub is 500k+ subscribers.

     I don't believe any of it and I've followed these posts from the start. Tried to have an open mind but it just seems like a lot of the people here want so badly for all of this to be true and I find that strange.

      It is very disconcerting how badly they want it to be real despite an overwhelming lack of actual evidence beyond some edgy Instagram posts and the fact that grown adults like pizza and think children are cute and/or funny. Despite my comments, I also came in with an open mind and only started commenting when I saw the 'evidence' for the perverted wishful thinking it seems to be

     Yeah I finally dove into their pile of evidence since this story hit The NY Times and it appears to be an eclectic pizza shop owner whose shop was mentioned in an email. I'm going to start countering by advising these people to file police reports where they can stake their identities to their beliefs if they want to harass these people.

     How does one justify Alfenatis instagram? That is the most flagrantly disturbing thing for me. Justify hotard.
     <br/>
     Other disturbing things might be explained away- that kid taped to the table was "a joke," they're just being edgy, etc. But, how is an infant a ho?

    I want more people to see this. I can't speak to my friends/family about this as they all think it's just a buncha crazy internet B.S, but it's not at all. There is seriously no innocent way that this is all a big misunderstanding. No fucking way. A grown man with no children understands the pictures he posted are uncomfortable as fuck. No one with any sanity would say, "ah these are alright". They are disturbing. Hey let's just hashtag #killroom like it's not a fuckin SAW movie. Jesus Christ

     There are tons of random symbols all over that chalkboard (multiple parallel horizontal lines, asterisk like symbols, dots in clumps, etc.). I'm not really sure spirals are enough to draw a connection to them, but if there's anything else connecting them I'd love to hear it.

      Yeah I think the spirals are a minor detail, but the other images the cross, pentagram etc are a bit dark for a high end pizza joint... As well as a event flyer

       Yeah but unless there's some reason suspect they have actual ties to this then it's just another place trying to be edgy. There are plenty of satanic themed stores where I live and while I don't know any pizza ones I don't think it's fair to make this sort of allegation when the only proof lies on symbols.

      There were tons of other examples on their tumblr, including a pizza ad with a spiral digitally added to cover the top of the pizza, art featuring children's skeleton's dancing around a maypole on top of a pentagram, many depictions of pizza slices with a "masonic" eye...

      In the wikileaks emails it mentions holding a pizza party in Roberta's pizza in NY ... A quick look online shows that the Clinton's as well as Jayz, Beyoncé etc all love the place... But it doesn't look to me like the type of place high level people would visit

      This is also the place that sold a leather mesh tank top with a pentagram on it for 700.00

    2)  When someone, especially  a mainstream reporter,  allegedly  practising investigative journalism  insinuates that any sane person would doubt it, they've used a psychological technique applied in propaganda, which purpose is to pre-establish the outcome (biased)  while shaming and guilting a person for holding an idea that's contrary to their position.    This type of technique isn't  professional investigative journalism,  it's biased guilt-tripping.      Kang has used a psychological technique that supports her opinion that Comet Ping Pong allegations are unfounded, guilting for not holding her view, and failed to provide ANY  thorough investigation to substantiate her position.  #FAIL.

    The most credible writers are those who make their arguments while presenting the best arguments of those with opposing views.  It's rare to find and the failing NYT constantly fails in this regard.

    If you are looking for a balanced critical look of Pizzagate, this thread's main post was a reasoned argument:
   </p>
   <p>
    https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5dr69d/debunking_the_pizzagate_evidence_please_read/
   </p>
   <p>
    But this actually requires an analysis of the evidence.   The NYT sloppy article contains no actual discussion of the real issues raised.   The above article does.   I disagree with its quick dismissal though of the evidence.

    The newspaper in Omaha, NE did the same thing when the Franklin scandal/coverup happened.  Turned out that the editor and prominent journalist on the paper were all peds.  How much you want to bet that the NYT doesn't have pedos on it's staff?  How best to protect them then to go after people digging and reporting this stuff.  Right now we simply do not have sufficient evidence to convict and NYT just let everyone know they are going to at least protect the democratic party peds with all of their ink. IMHO.

    Why is Obama's name  absent in the investigation?   Podesta  was his adviser, not only Clinton's adviser.    According to WikiLeaks  Obama had many phone links from  Comet Ping Pong.    An investigative connection should be done here.

     More precisely, a "phone bank fundraiser" was scheduled twice. There was a possibility of Obama showing up at a fundraiser for 100+ lawyers. $65000 was spent delivering "pizza and hot dogs" to the Whitehouse, but no outside food is allowed. One of the Soros SuperPAC paid about $35k (3 separate payments) for "catered events" but attendance unknown. The Obama connection is Alefantis 5 documented visits to the white house.

    I feel these pictures should be shown to the editor and be intermittently placed in the article to add more appropriate representation of the nature of the place. Since, pictures speak a thousand words...and this article seems to be lacking any important ones to defend the journalist's point of view. Plus, I am sure the people who have never heard of comet are dying to know what the management thinks is 'family appropriate' on their formerly public profiles that directly tagged comet pizza.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    besides, it's just family friendly art.
   </p>
   <p>
    anyone with a twitter feel free to post these pictures to the editor. no children in these pictures, for reasons.

    disregard the phallic looking "ping pong" that's too out there. especially since the topless dude is playing with an alien...
but perhaps point your attention to the graffiti on the wall that hasn't been cleaned up, at this 'family friendly' business
'shut up n fuck'
'amen to that'

    They are yet to explain and show us that the Handkerchief email wasn't related to the handkerchief code given that the use of code words Pizza (girl) and Map (semen) would fit so perfectly in the email, none of these issues have been properly adressed by the suspected people.

    Can i ask a completely serious question? Is it not at all possible that James Alefantis is simply a guy with high-up governmental connections who happens to run a pizza shop and enjoys kinda fucked-up art in his spare time? I've looked through all the information I can find and there's no real evidence tying him to kidnapping/keeping/having sex with children or child porn at all. The Instagram account is unnerving and weird, for sure, but it falls in line with the kind of guy he is if he hosts weird bands at his restaurant and hangs weird shit on the walls. And fair enough, maybe the type of person who would do that might be involved in trafficking children, but you have to have evidence of that past some (admittedly odd) "code-words" in his emails. I don't know, is there something I'm missing here?

    I barely understand the majority of pizzagate, but even I can see that most of this is lazily reported. I've never seen a single person say Hilary was some sort of pedophile mastermind, and Podesta has only been mentioned because of creepy shit he's been associated with.
