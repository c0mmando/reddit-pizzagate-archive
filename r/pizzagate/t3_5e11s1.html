        <strong>I find it really unsettling that with all this information not ONE person has come forward and been the whistleblower on this yet.</strong>
        <p><p>I've been following this since the emails were first leaked and have read tons of emails with the references, links, ties, etc. to businesses and government officials. I personally can't prove or disprove any of it but the amount of evidence is so monumental in proving that there is a very well coordinated child sex ring that it makes me wonder how not a single person that would have concrete evidence this is going on has not said anything. I can understand the repercussions of leaking such damning information to the public but it would be for the greater good of the country and world. They need to be brought down. I hope the people here and on 4chan can continue and shed more light on this problem. </p>
<p>The way they talk about pizza in the emails, I'm sorry NO ONE talks like that. It's unsettling and disturbing. I wouldn't put it past the wealthy to be involved in something as sick as this. Good luck to all. </p></p>

        <p><p>Maybe because they aren't running a pedophilia ring out of a small pizza shop?  Do you seriously think these people can't afford a house or warehouse or storage space for their activities?  Or that they would risk operating something like that from their own damn business?</p></p>
