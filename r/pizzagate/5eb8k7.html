    "A fake story published before the presidential election accused the restaurant, Comet Ping Pong, of being part of a child abuse ring led by Clinton and her campaign chairman, John Podesta, the New York Times reported. The entire story was false."
   </p>
   <p>
    What "Story"? no fuckers published a story accusing anyone of anything regarding this because MSM won't say jack shit about this... NTY and now this absolute hack piece.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is how it went...
   </p>
   <p>
    1&gt; Podesta Wikileaks with strange pizza code &amp; Comet Ping Pong references released.
   </p>
   <p>
    2&gt; Internet detectives looked into owner of Comet Ping Pong on social media.
   </p>
   <p>
    3&gt; Internet detectives realized from looking at James "Jimmycomet" Alefantis on public social media that he, his friends and business are most likely involved in CP.

      <strong>
       There was no fake story published before this one
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      That's an outright LIE. The "story" was being passed around social media at the time they alleged that there was a published article about it. Very purposefully worded stuff here and it makes all the difference in our credibility.
     </p>
     <p>
      Discussion on a social media forum IS NOT =///= A published "fake" news story
     </p>
     <p>
      NYT and Daily Mail UK were the first "real news" outlets to come near #pizzagate, Both were published over 2 weeks AFTER the elections, and both articles dismiss the "conspiracy" outright. NEITHER are supportive.

    For people who are just starting to question the establishment, this is a perfect example of how media manipulation works. There's the fact that they completely discredit this investigation without addressing any of the real issues being raised. But we can also see the coordinated effort among the media outlets. First, they wanted to discredit pizzagate by attacking the actual people who believe it. We were labeled as alt-right racist and homophobic conspiracy theorists. That was a little too extreme, so they had to settle for the rhetoric of "fake news." There's already a strong push of this 'fake news' narrative, and it will only grow in intensity. But in the end, I really believe this will all backfire for them

    Well, I guess at least it is getting attention. The chick who wrote the NYT one is under attack on twitter, so it looks like if anyone does any further research than just reading the article they will see which is really the 'fake news'.

     The article is 239 words long. Look how many times she says "fake news story" "fabricated" "false" in such a short article. No mention of toddlers taped to tables either of course.

    It is an opinion piece.  They do not even show any artwork.  Perhaps NYT readers would think something is up if they saw that.

    And, no comments are allowed at that site.  Lol.

     Funny how all the 'real' national news sites don't have comment sections anymore. I wonder if regional news sites still do?
    </p>
    <p>
     If so we should flood regional network websites with redpills when this thing is that big.

      They got rid of the comments section so they can control the narrative.  We cannot call them on their bullshit anymore.

     Daily Mail just ran a similar story, and it's full of inconsistencies and falsities.

   <p>
    They've begun constructing the fake news =/= pizzagate scandal. They cite this started from a fake news website - we all know that is incorrect, it started in r/the_donald and 4chan and then moved over here. This might suggest the MSM is complicit and the 'fake news' story was constructed to nullify our investigation.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is classic propaganda, watch them now repeat this fake news narrative over and over until the brainwashed except it as fact. The method is tried and tested.

    As we in gamergate learned, this is the start of the media push to discredit you. Next, "pizzagaters" will have done some horrible thing, and after, "citogenesis" will happen, where MSM refers to MSM as a reliable source.
   </p>

    There isn't a solution other than a recommendation: try not to get distracted by it. Don't apologize.

    This is what is referred to as battle space preparation. This will be labeled "fake news" by the established media and all information that develops from this will be tarred with that label.

    It's what happens when you Instagram disturbing photos and talk about eating babies for dinner ... but then maybe we're being judgmental.

    How about give us evidence that the children from the instagram photos are alive and well.....where are the children? If they are indeed pedos/murderers then there either be an abused child that can be medically looked at or if they murdered the kids then we might or might not find the body...either way, finding the children will answer EVERYTHING. Where in the actual fuck are the fucking children???
