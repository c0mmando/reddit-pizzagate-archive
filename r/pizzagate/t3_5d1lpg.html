        <strong>The Web of Slime</strong>
        <p><p>The Web of Slime</p>
<p><strong>There is a web of transparent slime that reaches out from the Tavistock Institute across the world and into your lives.</strong> The slime is tainted with every imaginable evil along with some that were once unimaginable and it comes in the guise of social and organizational science aimed at manipulating the minds of large populations for “the greater global good.”</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavistock_Institute</p>
<p>On the surface, the Tavistock Institute works through many organizations; think tanks, research institutes, charitable organizations. The dark underbelly includes infiltrating religions, from the large to the smallest of cults, intelligence agencies and news organizations.</p>
<p>http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/tavistochumanrelations.htm</p>
<p>In a DC Leak of the Open Society Foundation reveals some of the vocabulary and tactics they use to control people:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of our 2015 racial narrative work focused on the role of <strong>“othering” and implicit bias as a vehicle for limiting opportunities for immigrants and communities of color.</strong> As defined by grantee the <em>Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society</em>, <strong>“othering is a set of common processes that engender marginality and persistent inequality across any of the full range of human differences.” Societies use these distinctions to justify unequal treatment that ranges from discrimination to genocide.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>http://soros.dcleaks.com/</p>
<p>Maybe you begin to see the problem.</p>
<p>There is mask of polite sounding names where billions of dollars are being spent to control the perceptions of the people practically everywhere in the world. The False Memory Syndrome Foundation is one of those.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rarely has such a strange and little-understood organization had such a profound effect on media coverage of such a controversial matter."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The world bought it hook, line and sinker.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The claims made by the FMSF for the incidence and prevalence of false memories have been criticized for lacking any evidence, and disseminating inaccurate statistics about the alleged extent of the problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Memory_Syndrome_Foundation</p>
<p><strong>The power of these groups is remarkable when used in tandem with the media</strong>, which is also directed by the same people. Wikileaks has recently reminded us of this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Internal strategy documents and emails among Clinton staffers shed light on friendly and highly useful relationships between the campaign and various members of the U.S. media, as well as the campaign’s strategies for manipulating those relationships.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>http://www.wnd.com/2016/10/wikileaks-names-65-reporters-in-cahoots-with-hillary/</p>
<p>It goes back a lot further than that, though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Operation Mockingbird was a campaign by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to influence media during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird</p>
<p>Surely, that would never happen today, right? Unfortunately, it is more the case, than ever. A law was recently passed that sanctioned this behavior within the United States.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As shocking as the finding sounds, it only validates the practice — in fact, the report centers around a case from 2007 in which an FBI agent pretended to be an Associated Press journalist to identify an elusive suspect online. At the time, the FBI “did not prohibit agents from impersonating journalists or from posing as a member of a news organization,” the report states.

<p>It gets worse, because there is a third component to this that really drives home the manipulation. You need complete control of enough individuals to affect change in certain situations. How would you do such a thing? Realistically, how does your organization reach into someone's life directly to force them to do something when the media wasn't enough?</p>
<p>Truthfully, there are a lot of ways. Money. Blackmail. Political favors. Sexual favors. Religion.</p>
<p>The Tavistock Institute set up a variety of cults a long time ago to test the effectiveness of a variety of methods. In addition to making their own cults, they infiltrated others. From the Mormons to the Muslims. From the New Age to the Occult. From Moloch to the Flying Spaghetti Monster.</p>
<p>The Process Church of the Final Judgment is of note because it comes from Tavistock and it contains the elements of all religions in an effort to combine symbology, because symbols are shortcuts to the communication of large amounts of thoughts, as opposed to explaining them. 4chan delights in the same idea. Cultural Symbol Mimetics, where simple images evolve through a social group and communicate long running jokes and years of history with a single picture of a cartoon frog wearing a MAGA hat.</p>
<p>Because the Process Church of the Final Judgment believes in combing Jesus with Satan and Yahweh with Lucifer, we have an example of exactly the type of people that would be able to infiltrate a church or cult by presenting it as "the next level of understanding."</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Process_Church_of_The_Final_Judgment</p>
<p>The Internet has been searching for an answer to why all of these bizarre sets of symbols have emerged among a group of politically powerful people involved in a wide variety of crimes. Fucking Pizzagate. The most delicious gates of them all. More people have sunk into a slice of scandal than ever before and it cost the powers that be their Tavistock Candidate.</p>
<p>Congratulations, by the way.</p>
<p>If you are here and you are reading this, you understand Pizzagate, so I won't go over it. I believed it was true, based on what I was seeing, but the why is the important part.</p>
<p>Why do you need a network of kidnapped children? Prostitution? Human sacrifice? Blackmail? Sex slaves? All of the above and then some. But there is one more very troubling aspect to all of this.</p>
<p><strong>MIND CONTROL</strong></p>
<p>Sounds crazy, right? Not as crazy as it sounded 20 years ago.</p>
<p>By now, many of you are familiar with MK Ultra.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations and torture, in order to weaken the individual to force confessions through mind control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra</p>
<p>At the time, most people couldn't even grasp the extent of mind control that was possible. But, you needed a few key ingredients. Not everyone is suggestible... that is, susceptible to hypnosis. Some people are highly suggestible and it seems that intelligence doesn't play a role as to whether you are suggestible or not. If you wanted to mind control and average person on the street, the odds are that it wouldn't be worth it and you wouldn't get the desired effect. So it was studied.</p>
<p>What did we learn? To get someone under complete control, you need to create a dissociative break. You need to trigger the psychological defense mechanism that all people have, once they reach a certain point of trauma where they escape into their own head. Alice in Wonderland, anyone? </p>
<p>But, now, you have a broken human. Generally, they aren't much good. This is where all of the child trafficking comes in. You need kids for this. A lot of them. They need to be smart, they need to be suggestible, and they need to be able to function in society after you have broken them. You also need to maintain the perception that there is constant threat of death. It can never go away. Not just of you, but of everyone you care about.</p>
<p>Enter the artificial satanic cults. Fake enough where you can make satanic pizza jokes on your instagram account, but real enough to have the victims under your complete control. The ones who are too stupid or too broken are expendable. Their sacrifice serves to bind everyone involved and they are all insulated by a layer of mutually assured destruction combined with a constant fear of the others killing you if you mess up.</p>
<p>But is Tavistock even tied to Pizzagate?</p>
<p>Is Tavistock even tied to Hillary?</p>
<p>Yes and yes.</p>
<p>Tavistock arm, the Brookings Institute is operated by Strobe Talbott.</p>
<p>Strobe Talbott is in regular communication with Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/?q=strobe+talbott</p>
<p>The victims of the Hampstead Satanic Ritual Abuse were getting counseling at Tavistock.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After Alisa came back from Russia, James has already begun the counseling seesions in the Tavistock Centre after witnessing the violence towards me and been hit my Mr Dearman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>http://loveforlife.com.au/content/15/03/30/darkness-visible-part-one-d-hampstead-satanic-ritual-abuse-children-gabriel-draper-</p>
<p>They were accused of making it up, a la the False Memory Syndrome, but medical records removed all doubt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The medical reports end any debate regarding the fact that children A and G were the victims of child sexual abuse in Hampstead and underline the criminal nature of the police interviews of September 17th, 2014.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://crimesofempire.com/2015/03/11/hampstead-leaked-medical-reports-end-all-doubt-about-sexual-abuse-claims/</p>
<p>There you have it. A mostly straight line from Hillary Clinton to a victim of satanic ritual abuse.</p>
<p>It potentially gets way worse, though.</p></p>
