    Here's the smoking gun. This place is 500 feet from where this little girl was taken from her parents. The fact that this man headed one of the presidential campaigns makes me tremble at how deep we would be in shit if Hillary Clinton had been elected.

     What smoking gun?
    </p>
    <p>
     There is no proof the Podestas were in Portugal. This article is just repeating the same anon troll on 4chan who was pretending to be FBI. (Why the hell would the FBI know about a Portugese case involving the UK police anyway?)
    </p>
    <p>
     There is also no source or evidence for the claim that the Podestas borrowed that house.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is also still the problem that those two sketches were of one man in his thirties who has been accounted for, not of two men in their sixties who are still at large.
    </p>
    <p>
     Look, I'm not going to comment on the whole pizza code thing here. But this subtopic about McCann? This is as dumb as people seeing Jesus in a toasted cheese sandwich.

      There would actually be a record of him leaving the country...and having that leaked would permit us to track the flight. But you're 100% correct as there is no smoking gun as yet...plenty of very good circumstantial evidence but no body...as yet.

       What is very good circumstantial evidence to you?  The evidence seems tissue-thin or false.  That picture of the girl with John Podesta?  That is his granddaughter

        I was going to ask the same thing. All they've got is that the Podestas knew a guy who wasn't there when the crime happened.

        The best evidence we have so far linking them to the McCann abduction is (a) the sketches, (b) the wiping of the emails (6-month gap in emails ending the day after the abduction), and (c) authorities say they have identified the perpetrators but can't act on it.  (The only logical reason the authorities wouldn't be able to act is that the perpetrators are powerful and protected, a cover-up.  Remember there is this thing called extradition, and the other option would be to provide their evidence to Portuguese authorities so
        <em>
         they
        </em>
        could make an arrest.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Some people dismiss the sketches, saying they're the same man.  Why would sketches of the same man look so different?  I have a theory.  Maybe the investigators knew who the perps were early on, and were threatened by superiors to let it go.  So the investigators made up a story of two witnesses to give them an excuse to publish sketches of the Podestas.

      They say an FBI source, but I agree - this is a problem we face, a lot of blog sites looking to rack up even $5 in revenue are going to imaginative lengths to rehash and stretch truth.

       Read it again. It's just an anon. They call it an "anon FBI" source, but either they're being dishonest or they don't realise 4chan has trolls. Pick one.

     This. Do we at least have some proof that this pedo guy with the house has other connections to the Podestas to solidify this connection?

      Pedo guy with the house, daughter in law was Rupert Murdochs Daughter. Id be 99% certain they knew each other. Heres a Photo of Murdoch and Hilary so be sure he knew Podesta http://www.conservapedia.com/Rupert_Murdoch

       Murdoch was involved in the coverup as was Tony Blair and company.

     I agree that we need more substantiated facts, but what this article is saying is that this is clearly enough circumstantial evidence to warrant  an investigation. Yet we all know that won't happen, so we need to do it ourselves.

      For that I upvoted - the FBI contact associating him - we don't know, but it feels compelling.

     Could someone know how to contact Victurius Libertas ? It's them that point out an anon FBI source. If we get further evidences from this source, it could get us very close to the truth.

    Sorry, but it looks like a collection of facts scrapped from this sub and reverse-engineered into a click bait.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not a single piece of information in this article is new. I've seen everything here, on this sub, or in reliable press.
   </p>
   <p>
    The sketches look
    <em>
     incredibly
    </em>
    similar to Podestas, but they were produced not by demand if Portuguese police, but a private investigator. Does anyone know more about those sketches?
   </p>
   <p>
    We also know that
    <em>
     one
    </em>
    of the Podestas was travelling on that day. There's a "fare well" wish in one of the emails. But they travel
    <em>
     a lot
    </em>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    TLDR: need more proof that they were in Portugal.

     You're correct, it's a shit article.

     The sketches are from 2 different witnesses accounts of the same man.

     The anon FBI source seems to be fabricated and there is no evidence to suggest Freud had loaned his mansion to the podesta brothers. They claim there's an email - however searching 'Clem' or 'Freud' in the leaked podesta emails does not produce anything relevant.

     The closest proof you'll find that John Podesta was out of the office, if not the country, on May 4 2007 is this email from wikileaks.  Someone named Elizabeth (secretary maybe?) was using John Podesta's email that day.  This is in no way proof they were in Portugal, but the day is intriguing.  Another odd thing is every email (that wikileaks has) sent in June of 2007 ended up going to dead email accounts, as if he was trying to send stuff to people who got spooked and had killed their email accounts.

      i feel like there was a conference or something going on in Portugal that they were/would have attended. memory is a bit fuzzy on that though, it was in one of the many many pizza threads.

       I posted that there was a performance art conference (Performa 2007) in Portugal. I don't know if they were there. Someone went through the pictures from the conference and neither was in one of the pictures but ???

    The order of events is that Clem sold the house and rented it back. Initially he was NOT there...the Podesta boys supposedly were staying at the house. Post abduction Clem came to the house and befriended the McCanns and invited them over etc...that child could have been literally locked up in that house while her parents were there.
   </p>
   <p>
    That is some creepy ass shit.
   </p>
   <p>
    The evidence that Podesta was not in office is strong...and he and Tony absolutely match the sketches...but I'm going to need more than anonysources to know for certain they were indeed in that house when Maddy disappeared.

      Yeah I saw that. The circumstantial evidence is VERY strong...but posting that sekrit FBI agent said they were in portugal without actually proving that...in this situation is going to raise eyebrows considering we have had people come here posting actual shit you cannot believe claiming to have gotten it from pizza thing...we have to cross Ts and dot I's impeccably or the invaders are going to win at discrediting us.
     </p>
     <p>
      Personally I believe the links are strong...and the fox news story about "we know who they are but it will create international incident if we arrest them" sort of thing...well...
     </p>
     <p>
      still we need absolute proof of where he was....once we have that...jaysus...

       This sub has been taken over by tin foil hats already. We have threads of people theorizing that good and humor ice cream has a secret pedo code in their logo and that anyone who donated to hati is directly tied in as a occult pedo human traffiker....

    If you really want Pizzagate to be successful, ya'll need to drop this McCann story. It is completely ridiculous and the ties are tenuous. Plus it just logically doesn't make any sense why these specific guys would need to kidnap a random girl while on vacation.

    I've been following this shit for like 3 weeks and I've been saying this since I saw the first infograph about the Madeline girl- THIS IS DISINFO.
   </p>
   <p>
    James Alefantis instagram, Besta pizza, Abramovich, Jeff Koons, Icmec and the occult art world being involved in money laundering for human trafficking were all legit, but the Madeline thing is fucking stupid. Let me put it this way, I've been on house arrest, so I've have a LONG TIME to sit here as an armchair investigator and contribute to the digging DAILY without interruptions. I first noticed the Podesta brothers faces juxtaposed next to the facial composites of the Madeline girls abductors, there was also a picture of fucking Obama as one of the alleged abductors which looked especially retarded. I came to the conclusion that Pizzagate was gaining traction a little too fast so the shills needed to inject some disinfo into the discourse and then astroturf the Madeline thing until it became part of the evidence that people were memeing
   </p>
   <p>
    Anyone familiar with the Sandyhook/boston bombing digging threads on 4chan will remember that the shills used a similar tactic by making "tony hawk crisis actor" memes which were used to discredit the internet sleuthing and make us all look like idiots.
   </p>
   <p>
    It's great that so many people have taken interest in this subject and it's especially exciting for me because I've been researching the subject of SRA for awhile now. Although I'm ecstatic by how fast this has blown up, I'm a little discouraged when I see people blindly sharing memes without doing their own research. The whole subject of SRA is littered with so much disinformation that it becomes increasingly hard to discern truth from fiction, and too many of you fall for the bait.
   </p>
   <p>
    This shit is hard and it's like circumnavigating through a mine field. Make sure your really look into things in depth before assuming that it's real. There is a plethora of information out their and it's very easy to get confused. Keep digging and be vigilant!

    If there is proof Podesta was in Portugal at the time of abduction, we know for sure the bastard is the kidnapper.

    Is anyone in power uncorrupted enough to move on this evidence? Can Interpol issue an extradition warrant? There is already more evidence against these men than there is against Julian Assange and he has been forced into living in a foreign embassy for 4 years. The fate of the Podesta Brothers should be much worse than that. Who in the world has jurisdiction and is good enough to act here?

    This website and story are bullshit, the FBI didn't even investigate the case, so how the fuck would an FBI 'anon' know what happened, it was investigated by Portugese police then covered up by Mi5, total disinformation, if you honestly research this case it will become obvious that the parents and friends of Madeline were responsible for her death.

     An FBI agent would probably have the capability to obtain flight logs, whether there was a sanctioned investigation or not, but if there really were an anonymous FBI leaker, why wouldn't they leak

     rather than just an unsubstantiated anonymous claim?

     Maybe they sold her.

    Mods, please denote that this whole theory about Maddie McMann rests upon an "FBI anon insider"... There's no fucking proof here. People are making hay all over the place connecting the CF with twitter and everything else, but this idea that the Podestas personally kidnapped some girl makes no damn sense. Why would they do that when they could get children to abuse through the seemingly huge network of connected pedos that they appear to be a part of? This whole idea is nonsense. Inb4 shill, the people pushing this maddie mcmann BS are the shills. It's disinfo because they know it actually isn't true and if they can prove that they weren't in portugal at the time (which would probably be easy because right now there's absolutely no proof that they were) then they have an alibi and all of the efforts focused on this will have been pointless. The real leads are elsewhere, lads.

    I don't see why people think this is unrealistic. He was a minor celebrity and was a politician for a small amount of time. It seems realistic that someone like him would know someone like John Podesta. Especially if they were both child molesters. No-one knows where the Podesta brothers were when she disappeared and so it seems to have substance to me.

    Summary (part of #Pizzagate); 
Clement Freud confirmed friend of paedophiles;
Podestas confirmed friends of paedophiles; 
McCann taken during period when 2 people looking very much like Podestas were identified; 
Probabilities; CIA - 5% - they manage the corruption of world leaders program so are unlikely to have leaked this; 
DI (Military Intelligence) - 55% - very likely they are leaking this as either truth or fabrication. Either way they are helping reveal the corruption of the CIA program and the Clinton Foundation and Bush/Clinton Regime; 
Truth - 40%;
   </p>
   <p>
    In all 3 cases there is much for new FBI (post inauguration) to explore. No doubt they already have everything needed for indictment of many people.

    I think this path is a waste of time.
Why would these rich and powerful men risk doing this stuff themselves?
The only thing I can think of is the thrill of being caught, but even that is IMO far fetched.
Am I wrong?
   </p>
   <p>
    Plus, where is the
    <strong>
     proof/evidence
    </strong>
    that they where in Portugal that date?

      OK. Reasonable.
But what about the claim that they were in Portual at the time?
Source for this? Hint, clue, anything at all?
