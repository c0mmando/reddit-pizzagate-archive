        <p><p>Would you, or anyone else be interested to dig in the Natascha Kampusch case aswell.</p>
<p>Franz Kröll, the main investigator, said, that there were heavy ties to Austrian politics/pedophiles.</p>
<p>He said, it was as big as the Lucano case in the 80s, until days later he commited suicide out of nowhere. Just like the investigator in the Lucano case (Lucano case is not relevant here)</p>
<p>Wolfgang Priklopil and Ernst Holzapfel are the 2 main relevant names here.</p>
<p>There are several questionable suicides here aswell.</p></p>

        <p><p>I forget which post or site I saw it on but there was a related link to a photo of a guy with a mustache bemoaning the closing of some pizza place and the business had a German sounding name and the menu items were in German. prices were in €. BUT the creepy thing, besides coming up in one of these summaries, was the item descriptions were in English and one I remember was "Just like a long hot sticky summer fuck...€10,000. Very suspicious. </p></p>

        <p><p>Before much of this and other things pertaining to this conspiracy became increasingly public knowledge I would explain matters to others. They would ALWAYS say "that's just a coincidence". In every conversation. The human mind looks for patterns. We cling to our worldviews. Anything that conflicts we must explain away or change our worldview. 
Most popular: Crazy, fake, right wing propaganda, coincindence. Or just "conspiracy theorist" a CIA propaganda term btw.

        <p><p>A corner stone of occult knowledge. It dates back to ancient egypt. Light up and watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSNV5m-qOAg 
The secret or rather the occult societies posess this hidden knowledge and apply it for control. Watch from minute 4:00 onward for verification https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L777RhL_Fz4&amp;index=2&amp;list=PL0EekPe-iLvKtq3fL-gu2X64zVY1xPqHg 
From one playlist I made that led me down my personal illumination https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0EekPe-iLvKtq3fL-gu2X64zVY1xPqHg
Fundamentaly we need to all wise up BIG time and unite.

        <p><p>Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but it is a coincidence.
Im a huge football fan and remember the original "pizzagate". These teams are playing at the weekend so thats why it is the news!</p>
<p>Also this happened in 2004, which from Google Trends, shows that there was a spike then, also 10 years later as the sports media carried the story again. This is evident on Trends!</p>
<p>OK. I dont know why I am getting downvoted here. I have mearly stated facts, as I mentioned I am a huge football fan and the mention of "pizzagate" to any football fan, they will know exactly what you are talking about. If you too are a football fan,then come along an rebuttal me or criticize me or tell me otherwise. But this downvotting because I mearly disagreed with the OP is BS. The main aim of this sub is to investigate the topic at hand. Jumping on to a post like this and making your mind up without even considering other evidence will just lead to this investigation been looked upon as a joke!</p>
<p>Yes there are plenty times the media has covered up stuff and in the past I have presented plenty of evidence showing this but Im telling you now, this is not one of those times! </p></p>

        <p><p>They've played against each other 29 times since 2004. Are there 29 "let's remember pizzagate" articles or just this time they did one?</p></p>

        <p><p>Not 29 times, but at least on 10, perhaps more occasions when they have met I recall the sports media running stories, as I mentioned before, before this current "pizzagate" became news, the term "pizzagate" was solely known as the incidence in that football match. The incident even has its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Buffet">wiki page</a>
And if you look at the wiki page sources for this topic,there are 73 references, most of them originating from newspapers from between 2004 to the present, so yes it has been covered many times in "let's remember pizzagate" articles!</p></p>

        <p><p>I did a search going back and admittedly there has been a ton written about it even recently. Could be a coincidence, we'll never know. I do think it's interesting they put "pizzagate" in the title of the story which bumps up the search engine priority on that key word.</p></p>

        <p><p>Thank you. The important thing for this sub to remember is that we have many people with differing skills on here, that we should be able to cross check and verify each others claims, for example, in this case Im the football fanatic and knew that this story has been carried many times from my own memory. Doing this keeps the investigation in check, discards any bogus, disinfo or other completely false statements. This will help the investigation further!</p></p>

        <p><p>Well there's r/satangate which was established weeks ago—I know it came before the "pizzagate" name took off, because we were all discussing in the Wikileaks and conspiracy subs what kind of name we could give this shit in order to easily push it into public discourse, but I don't know how easy it would be to rename the scandal at this point </p></p>

        <p><p>You also have a lot of people on this sub who are working hard to derail pizzagate through misdirection, such as trying to make connections that are outlandish or merely coincidence. Do you think they're doing this to lead new visitors to believe that there's no actual conspiracy? I'm thinking of the posts that implicate Pres-elect Trump because of innocuous pizza-related news (such as his Pizza Hut ads and the whole eating-pizza-with-a-fork fake controversy). </p></p>

<p>Or is there a football-scandal with the same name already?</p></p>

        <p><p>If you're a United fan ( as I am) you even come across it when we're not playing Arsenal.  It's always being talked about on forums like Republik of Mancunia for example.</p>
<p>Also to suggest that the Daily Star would be pushing anything further down on Google shows they don't know how few people actually read it, and those that do are generally not the type to be following this news anyway.</p>
<p>I am sure there is something underhand going on but this proves nothing.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don't think you want to argue with me on this one. Let's not even fucking argue over 9/11. It doesn't fucking matter anymore. Asange hasn't had an interview or video confirmation since Ecuador. The governments of the entire world were implicated in his ultimate file dump. He is compromised and we are on our own. They are no longer fixated on him, as evident by them giving a fuck about this subreddit. The "matrix" chat links are honey pots. I don't care if you're right about 9/11. This is different brother. Watch your back. This is 1984. </p></p>

        <p><p>Agreed. The Wikipedia article already used the term "Pizzagate" in August 2015. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_the_Buffet&amp;oldid=678437459</p>
<p>On the other hand, the event has not gained any significance since it happened, so if it will blow up in media outlets now, I'd say it's a coverup attempt. </p></p>

        <p><p>Not coincidence, it's mockery and tacit acknowledgement. The [Daily Star's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Star_(British_newspaper) owner is one of the richest men in Britain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Desmond">Richard Desmond</a>, who resides in Hampstead Village in London - home of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ1aBCOeVlk">infamous satanic ritual abuse case</a>. His publishing company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_%26_Shell">Northern &amp; Shell</a> made its money in the early going producing pornography. When not busy covering the "other pizzagate" his media companies are typically pushing royal family propaganda. Not "proof" of anything but just some interesting information for people like myself who have already made up they're minds in terms of this London-based international crime ring.</p></p>

<p>in the same paragraph. Its shit like this that detracts from the real info being dug up here that gives the opponents a chance to say "look at what they are saying, they are just reaching for anything"</p>
<p>Stick to things that you <strong>can</strong> prove and this will become a lot more real. Otherwise it'll just go in the books with the dozens of other "conspiracies" surrounding this group of people. </p></p>

        <p><p>Me too, footy pizzagate was when Sir Alex Ferguson the Man Utd manager got hit on the head by some pizza thrown by an arsenal player, its not synonymous with man utd v arsenal.
Also people involved are no longer at their respective clubs anyore</p></p>

        <p><p>A post with sense, finally. This is merely jumping on a 'trend' (the name pizzagate) and shamelessly plugging their own story of the football-related story by the same name. It is, as the other guy said, fishing for page views to boost revenue from a trashy paper. Believe me as a Brit, The Star does not carry the weight necessary to act as a 'cover-up'.</p></p>

        <p><p>The 'trend' I am referring to is THIS trend (our pizzagate). This is trending all over. Someone at the Star has, in my opinion, simply noticed the trend of this term and either used it to tie in with the football story for their own benefit, or mistook it for the football story and promoted that anyway. I'd assume the former but either way I don't see it being anymore than that. Like I said before, the Daily Star has no real pull in the UK. If it were one of the bigger ones, like The Sun or The Guardian, for example, then I may have been suspicious. As it is I am not in the slightest and I don't believe anyone else should be either.</p></p>

The teams played each other (crazy intense match, a lot of fouls and Arsenal ended up losing their 49 game win streak) and allegedly an Arsenal player threw pizza at Man United's manager in the tunnel after the game. And, as any pizza related controversy, it was dubbed "pizzagate". </p>

        <p><p>Could be. I don't know, in the world of football things that have happened in the past are constantly being brought up and discussed in this fashion. ex players coming out and discussing the events. Timing is coincidental, unsure if it's enough to form a solid connection</p></p>

        <p><p>United plays Arsenal in two days. It's the first game for either team in over a week. Pizzagate was the most significant event between two of the top three successful English clubs at their peak. You won't hear anything about it until the next time they play, but the English media salivate over the thought of a clickbait article relating to United, the football club with the largest following in the world. </p></p>

        <p><p>Put it this way...
Manchester United and Arsenal have played many times since the 2004 pizzagate and this has not been bought up by MSM, asides from the 10 year anniversary of it happening in 2014.</p>
<p>Pizzagate has just began to gain traction internationally and is blowing up. This has been noticed, as is evident with some leftist news sites already denying its credibility, and calling those investigating "alt-right conspiracy theorists". Places involved such as Besta Pizza and the place with the big/ little hand and heart symbol have already redesigned their logos or deleted previous images. </p>
<p>It is clear this has been picked up on, and it is a case of Occam's razor that this article has been published now of all times to cover pizzagate and push it further out of the public eye.  It is just a feasible excuse (e.g. the same teams are playing this weekend) that is being exploited.</p></p>

        <p><p>First of all, you need to seperate sports media from normal media as they are completely different. Second of all, I have already mentioned above, that I personally recall it been in the sports media, especially UK sensationalist tabloid papers like the star, on no little than 10 occasions, that is just my memory of the story running. Also if you look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Buffet">wiki page</a> that covers the topic and you check the references, they are all referenced from newspaper articles ranging from 2004 until now, so yes it has been covered by the MSM plenty of times!!</p></p>

        <p><p>Are you kidding? This is brought up every single year. Ask any United supporter on /r/reddevils - I can't think of the last time the two played that the announcers didn't at least mention it. Look at the dozens of media references in the last decade on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Buffet">Wikipedia page</a>. United is the biggest club in the world and clickbait surrounding the club is written on an hourly basis.</p>
<p>And ffs, if anything it doesn't cover anything up, but brings more attention.</p></p>

        <p><p>Tbh that original Pizzagate was hilarious. This one not so much.</p>
<p>We are playing them this weekend which might explain the story. But more likely it's to deflect attention, SAF was the Utd manager this happened with. Would only be worthwhile to bring up the story if he was somehow relevant again</p></p>

        <p><p>Don't listen to these concern trolls who want to change #Pizzagate....
Don't be fooled.
Whether they know it or not they're being used like tools...
Don't underestimate the value of the #Pizzagate brand the media that are listening know about it. </p></p>

        <p><p>They mentioned both pizzagate and spirit cooking on CNN earlier today... including the implications of both... They said Clinton was a child sex trafficker... and the government was full of satanists.  It was as an example of what would be blocked as "fake news" going forward... but still... they said it on the TV. </p></p>

        <p><p>I had read of some kind of thchnique...to improve impressions or images of the target.If you want to make up good impression of a target,you can describe it with positive words.The target and positive image of the words will unite in your mind unconsciously.
Unless you want the target to discregit,use crass word in the sentence with it.
This technique is simple and seems to be natural as well.</p>
<p>edit:Add and correct some words and sentences.</p></p>

        <p><p>I saw this (both the wikipedia article and the google trends) a week ago. /u/toekneemontana is correct. Some of us even considered changing the name. I had no idea that the soccer-related pizzagate would EVER come into the public purview again.</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm going to lock this, the title is sensationalism (which turned out to be incorrect).</p>
<p>REDIT: I felt a pang of guilt as it IS being revisited and the timing is really really bad (of them). Gonna be interesting to see how google uses this to bury embarrassing news about their buddies the Clintons. I'm going to unlock it.</p></p>

<p>And that the authorities investigate.</p>
<p>That poor woman in Haiti that was killed is very saddening news,</p>
<p>I hope does not deter other people from investigating <strong>pizzagate</strong></p></p>

<li>Muddying the waters with an unrelated years-old scandal with the same name suddenly trending</li>
<li>CTR shills flooding the sub with tinfoil-hat distractions and troll posts and downvoting good info</li>
<li>Nope nothing to see here hurr durr</li>
</ul>
<p>If we have to change the name, PodestaGate or PodestaFiles would work. Podesta should be the focus anyway, and any attempt to hijack it would necessarily have to involve another Podesta scandal.</p></p>

        <p><p>You should change the name. Not only because of the cover up but because it sounds weird. I have seen this sub on reddit front page this past week but not bothered checking because it sounded weird. You need a name that draws attention. I've seen Pedogate mentioned, which is far better.</p></p>

        <p><p>pizzagate trended very well until it was censored by twitter and others. Either way, we discussed but by that time it was almost too late to change mid-stream. It certainly is now. Anything we use will be censored.</p></p>

        <p><p>Playing Devils Advocate.  The two teams mentioned in the article are playing each other and they are typically the 'bigger' teams in the Premier League (think the Pats-Seahawks game from last weekend).  Anyway, the timing is suspect at best.  why rehash an incident from 12 years ago when these teams have played each other no less than 30 times since and only one of them is likely to have a good season this year?</p></p>
