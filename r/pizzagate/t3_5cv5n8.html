        <strong>Is it normal for churches to have playgrounds?</strong>
        <p><p>I don't want to venture too far from the main plot here...could be totally unrelated but there is a epicostal church down the road from comet with an old crappy playground photographed as one the google pics. also a weird comment about "This church has something for everybody" could be super coincidence and just reaching, though.</p></p>

        <p><p>Okay, thanks. That's why I didn't wanna link the church and the pictures and stuff. In case it was totally normal. I don't live in USA and a playground around any religious building here would be super abnormal.  There's also a public school in near vicinity to comet on google maps which would explain the high volume of "unattended children" people talk about. But I also noticed comet's hours are kind of weird for a pizza parlour, they don't open until 5 PM. </p></p>

        <p><p>Churches like to be all things when possible. They want to suck you in and keep you there. They often serve food, have games, all sorts of puppet shows and stuff, cartoons, all religious based, that they use to try and keep kids interested in beingat church. Hard to blame them for that, getting kids interested in these dense, ancient, archaic texts has got to be an uphill battle.</p></p>

        <p><p>They open at 5PM on weekdays, which would suggest that they work day jobs. </p></p>
