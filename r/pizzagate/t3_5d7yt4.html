        <p><p>This thread is being created more or less to make try to make sense out of this bizarre relationship between pizza and satanism, and document  stuff that relate. It seems to be rather wide spread as there are several pizza parlors all over the country(and outside the country) that have satanic related themes:

        <p><p>Thanks for this. I had known about this one too, but it slipped my mind as I was listing these. Roberta's is an important one too. From what I understand, Bushwick Brooklyn has satanic and occult imagery all over town. </p></p>
