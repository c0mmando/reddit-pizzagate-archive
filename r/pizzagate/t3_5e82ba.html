<p><p>They handcuffed him and forced him to go to the hospital against his will due to "sleep deprivation".</p>
<p>At the very least, that alone is unsettling </p></p>

<p><p>Maybe he got Redpilled about everything recently and he legit went manic and couldnt sleep. I didnt see any videos of him mentioning pizzagate at his concert but he did make it seem like he knows things his audience actively ignores. If he was willing to have his audience hate him and endorse trump openly, he must know something and it mightve driven him off the wall. The truth is really harsh and I assume he knows it.</p></p>

<p>Kanye knew kanye saw and kanye fucking lost it, look at that video where shes being groped and shit.... this is getting really fucking shady</p></p>

<p><p>I'm not sure i completely follow. Are you saying Kim was raped or something during the robbery? and Kanye is extremely pissed over it and expressing those events in this video by having kim be groped by many people's hands? Or possibly you are insinuating Kanye is the DNC email leaker? Or maybe you're saying Kim was robbed by Kanye's illuminati handlers and he was secretly there and saw it all go down but has been keeping it secret for some reason? </p>
<p>lol. sory. I've been awake almost 48 hrs and I cannot into logic very efficiently atm. What am i missing tho? Did this joke just go over my damn head? Am I just severely autistic? Someone plz fill me in. thx u.</p></p>

<p><p>Or maybe he went off his Lexapro like he always does before recording an album or touring and snapped. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"See, before I let you go. One last thing I need to let you know. You ain’t never seen nothing crazier than this nigga when he off his Lexapro.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dudes been working on a fashion line, his wife got robbed, he's on tour with a new album, his mentor left him, and he's off his meds. Occam's razor. </p>
<p>Oh yeah, and his mom died 10 years ago this month.</p>
<p>Edit: Forgot where I was. Please excuse my rational explanation, I know it doesnt jibe well with the paranoia. Carry on.</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah bro..... Kanye went to the same high school as Seth Rich and literally has a song titled "<em>Shoot em in the back!</em>" where the chorus says </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WATCH HOW YOU SPEAKIN CUS I'LL LEAVE EM LEAKIN! LEAKIN! LEAKIN!" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>in the chorus. COMPLETELY meaningless...... surely..... </p>

<p><p>Just really take a moment and think about what an extreme accusation that is. The most likely thing, I think, is he just snapped. Second would be that he's doing it for attention and publicity. Third would be so he can get out of his tour and have it covered by performer's insurance. Then way down the list, at the bottom of the barrel of witchhunting and conjecture, is your idea. Please realize not everything is a conspiracy. Jumping to conclusions like this is what makes us all lose credibility.</p></p>

<p><p>Real shit, I feel so bad for the guy right now.</p>
<p>I've been fairly red pill for a while but the revelations of late have been like a red pill overdose. I actually started drinking again recently and I feel like the snap into the realities of the world have something to do with it.</p>
<p>With Kanye it's particularly shitty because he is an ever present icon in pop culture. I've had a breakdown before and fortunately I was able to do it in private, for all of his luxuries he sure as hell doesn't have that one.</p></p>

<p><p>You guys.. Come on.</p>
<p>I applaud the work done by this subreddit, it's incredibly interesting. But some of it.. Just no. </p>
<p>Kanye Wests mother died in November (not 2016). He feels like he played a role in his mothers untimely death. He always goes a bit off the rails with crazy rants and public displays this time of year. </p>
<p>Go read the transcript of his most recent rant at the concert they're now having to refund people $ for, just days before being hospitalized.. It has nothing to do with any of this. </p>
<p>People deal with grief in different, sometimes odd ways. </p></p>

<p><p>You're right that he's generally unhinged, and says crazy shit, and the thing about his Mom is legit as well. </p>
<p>That said, in his rant he specifically talks about Jay-Z sending people to kill him, and goes off about Beyonce. Jay and Bey have been linked to the Illuminati shit for awhile now, which I never really believed until this Pizzagate shit popped up. They routinely hang with the Obamas and the elites, so I feel like the assertion that they could be implicated in some occult shit is now a little less tenuous. Maybe Kanye found out about that, and it's affecting his life?</p>
<p>I saw some other theory that the robbery in Paris was a message from the elites/Illuminati/pizzagate people, like "if we can take the ring off your wife, imagine what else we can do," and that the media hasn't really been given the whole story about what happened. You link that up with Kanye melting down now, it gives some validity to that assertion as well. </p>
<p>I know it sounds nutty, but Kanye is a powerful public figure, and we're discovering pizzagate is a cabal of the most powerful people in the world. Kanye falls within that sphere, and would be rolling with those types of people. He may be privy to information we aren't, and maybe it's what fucked him up. I just feel like nothing is really off the table anymore as far as any loose connections that intersect with pizzagate. </p></p>

<p><p>This might be overly paranoid me, or just being a rational person. But, the top post on the front page right now is 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/5e7z42/kanye_west_hospitalized_after_abruptly_canceling/</p>
<p>I encourage you all to "control+f" search for kewords:</p>
<p>child, red, pill, pizza, gate, pedo, (this is where i gave up)</p>
<p>There is literally NO MENTION of pizzagate or the possible implications to this.  Just wanted to throw that out there. Also the thread is locked now. </p>
<p>Youre telling me all of reddit made no mention of pizza gate in this post.</p>
<p>Guess I'm just crazy.</p></p>

<p><p>There's a thread in r/television with Dave Chappell talking about how Martin Lawrence went crazy and all these other Hollywood people go crazy and what's going on in Hollywood to cause that... I mentioned pizzagate and twittergate and was accused of being a Trump troll. But it started a conversation about it in a default sub, it has not been locked, yet. </p></p>

<p><p>I havent seen any mention of him talking about pizzagate specifically. r/the_donald usually seeps out into other subs though. I just think its strange to find there are no comments at all about anything related to this pedo pizza ring. Try it yourself and try to find any mention of a keyword. If I'm wrong ill happily delete my comments.</p></p>

<p><p>I can see where you are coming from, despite him actually having no connections as far as evidence tells, some would likely mention it in comments anyway.</p>
<p>In keeping with this theory, I checked unreddit.com to look for any deletes from nazi mods, and of course, 6 mentions of 'pizza' https://unreddit.com/r/Music/comments/5e7z42/kanye_west_hospitalized_after_abruptly_canceling/</p>

<p><p>No way man I thought the exact same thing. Reddit is just as bad as other social media its bullshit. Noone is questioning why he 'lost it' after talking truths and agreeing to go on infowars. We need to get some serious motion behind this. People need to question it. </p></p>

<p><p>Yeah this story is either fake or this is just all lies and sketchy as fuck. Since when are doctors having patients taken against their will for something as simple as sleep deprivation. This is that fake news shit that just gets swept under the carpet while the truth is lost making it that much harder to expose things.</p></p>

<p><p>It's quite difficult to get a 5150.  And using restraints of any kind requires doctor's orders and are not taken lightly. </p>
<p>I don't know for sure if he was handcuffed or if that's just media sensation.  Have any of the gossip sites posted pics?</p></p>

<p><p>Not true. It's incredibly easy to get someone committed. In many states, if someone reports that you're suicidal to the police, they're required to cuff you and take you to the hospital for an evaluation. Kanye has been acting weird lately, walking out of his show after a long rant and then cancelling the rest of the tour. He's clearly distraught over something, and it would be incredibly easy to co-opt that and use it as "evidence" that he isn't mentally sound and needs to be committed. </p>
<p>It's already clear that these people are capable of doing just about anything and making just about anything happen. If Kanye found out a little more than they liked, getting him admitted to the hospital for "delirium" or a mental problem or something of that nature which would completely discredit anything he then says afterwards. </p>
<p>Obviously this is speculation, but it doesn't seem farfetched after everything that's been going on lately.</p></p>

<p>I'm 100% with you. </p>
<p>It's like the "fake news" narrative -- get out in front of any bad stories and delegitimize anyone who would report them before they happen.</p>
<p>Kanye could absolutely know something pizzagate-related, and he has the mouthpiece to reach tens of millions of people. I would say that's definitely cause to shut him up/scare him/delegitimize him.   </p></p>

<p><p>Seriously!I feel bad for him for the first time in his carreer no matter whats actually going on. I just wish we could see some evidence that showed him mentioning Pizzagate. I've been following this stuff for a few weeks now but haven't said a word but this really freaked me out bc of the timing of things said about him. Too freaking weird. </p></p>

<p><p>Go read his full rant. There's no pizza gate mention.</p>
<p>He's mad about radio stations making mediocre songs into hits by overplaying them (this is true; lots of methods for how they do this - Outkast's Hey Ya is a good example of a curated hit) and he rants about Mark Zuckerberg not giving him a billion dollars to develop his DONDA company and things like that. And about Jay-z not returning his calls - and asking Jay-z to please not have him killed. Also asks Khaled (?) not to send hitmen after him apparently.</p>
<p>The whole mention of Hillary is him drawing a parallel between her not accepting all of middle America and what matters to them - and radio stations sticking to old programming methods &amp; becoming as irrelevant as she is.</p>

<p><strong>He does make one very interesting claim: that Beyonce refused to perform at the VMAs unless they promised her to win Video of the Year. That's pretty corrupt, pretty messed up.</strong></p></p>

<p>I think his programming is already broken. That's why he's been going on these "bizarre" rants. This is a similar, yet more restrained (and honest), break to Britney Spears and Amanda Bynes'. </p>
<p>If he comes out of the hospital and disavows everything he said, then they succeeded at reprogramming him. </p></p>

<p><p>Another ones programming who broke was Tila Tequila. She was ranting on her facebook, twitter and youtube about the elite and pedos and hollywood etc and one day her facebook was wiped, she disapeared for a few days and came back and announced that she was pregnant and all her exposing posts disappeared. It was weird as fuck.</p></p>

<p>Videos like these are what she would post.</p>
<p>I found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYrlBogLrek">video</a> of a guy who observed the EXACT same I did. He documented it way better than I did. He draws some nutty conclusions that may not be true but just look at what he documented, exact same stuff I saw. One day she was ranting about illuminati etc and then she disappears briefly and comes back being pregnant with no mention of the illuminati stuff. </p></p>

<p><p>I say it was either an inside job for a kickback once the jewels are fenced or a complete lie perpetrated by Kim to get the insurance money on the jewelry. Kanye has made public statements that they are broke as fuck. </p></p>

<p><p>Some 'insider' on 4chan says the robbery was actually an attempted kidnapping by isis to cover up potential wikileak info drops. The drops never came so they ditched the plan and it was covered up as a robbery.</p>
<p>Sounds a bit far fetched but TBH who the fuck knows these days!</p></p>

<p><p>Yeah this came from "anon5's knowledge bombs." He basically states that ISIS cells in Paris had planned on kidnapping and killing her publicly after having reported plans to execute a female celebrity in the week leading up to it. This was to coincide with the potential 'Oct surprise' from wikileaks bombshell (suspected full release of pedophile/sex trafficking govt level involvement) that never really materialized in order to deflect the nation's attention away from it, which undoubtedly it would have done. Notice no one has released security footage and the media went out of its way to state that her personal security detail went with her sisters on the day of the incident. Then oddly enough Kanye fired the 'entire staff' days later. Anon5 went onto say that this was to coverup the fact that her security staff was with her and were executed in the process of her kidnapping. She was then raped and sent back to the US alive and with a message that she would disseminate to her elite web of friends. They stole her diamonds and this pink panther robbery story was peddled by the media, while quietly disposing of their previously drafted "Kim killed by extremists," copy. As terrifying as this might be to imagine, FBIanon did state in his 6th AMA that anon5's info was indeed legit, FWIW. Certainly it would explain why Kanye has become unraveled the way he has as of lately and why kim rarely leaves the house.</p></p>

<p><p>The video of Snoop Dogg that soared to the front of /r/all today is disturbing to me. He's at the Kanye show during the rant, talking about how far off the deep end Kanye is. And most of the people in the comments section are talking about pitiful/crazy/idiot Kanye's mental illness. </p></p>

<p><p>I'm sorry I have no idea where to look. It was the night before he walked off stage and it was on this sub though. I'm on mobile but just search Kanye in relation to pizzagate sub should pop </p>
<p>Edit: hopefully we can find a video actually, I think someone linked a video too. Someone with more autism than me use my details above to find it. Literally from the day before he walked off </p></p>

<p><p>Do you consider the kardashians the enemy? I watched the first few seasons of their show. They had a really good family vibe that I don't think they were faking. You don't get that by being "bad" ppl. They just seemed really wholesome I can't explain it. 
I think they're really good at making money by making themselves seem dumber than they are and manipulating ppl, which isn't exactly moral. But I don't think they're the enemy by any means
Their persona makes them rich. Dumb ppl fall for it and want to emulate them, but that's not inherently bad of them</p></p>

<p><p>Programming broke and he was on the verge of breaking the "big picture" and going nuclear on the people that killed his mother (call them the Illuminati if you want to...). They had to get him reprogrammed before that happened. </p></p>

<p><p>I remember seeing a video of him at a concert shortly after breaking down and saying "They killed my mama" or something along those lines. I'll have to see if I can find it.</p>
<p>There were a lot of reports that he did blame himself for his mother's death, as well as a weird post-Taylor Swift incident rant in which he says "My mother didn't die for this fame shit". Odd. But that seems to be the status quo for Yeezy</p></p>

<p><p>Hopefully we don't find out in a few days about how "depressed" he's been lately since he's about to kill himself tonight.</p>

<p><p>Anyone know anything about his mental health?  It sounds like he could be manic right now, which would be grounds for institutionalization.  Mania makes people a danger to tgemselves, even if they are more productive.  </p>

<p><p>Are we going to ignore that Kim was the victim of a highly organized robbery in the past 24 hours? The only reason they left is because alleging the bodyguard would be back with police if he didn't hear from Kim. http://radaronline.com/celebrity-news/kim-kardashian-gunpoint-robbery-paris-hotel-concierge-tell-all/</p>
