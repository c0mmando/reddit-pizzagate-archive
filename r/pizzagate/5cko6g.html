    I grew up in Nebraska, I have a friend who is much older than I, her brother was groomed to be a prostitute at boys town. After he got out that's all he knew and he continued his high class prostitution in the L.A. area and died early due to IV heroin addiction. When he was dying of Hep C he called her and told her that his whole life he was fucking guys and he's not even attracted to men. This shit is real, and it's very sad to corrupt any child like this.

     Well, there's no secret that things like this happen.  It'd be interesting to know if he was subjected to extremely traumatic and scarring torture.  Emotional, physical and mental prior to his grooming.  This would be the connecting factor for a lot of this I believe.

    Shit, I recently watched this. Fascinating but mostly profoundly disturbing.

    If some of you are curious as to why these crimes are swept under the rug, this doc provides some telling answers.

    Yes, there are two books out about that scandal.  Both excellent in that they get into many details about Offit AFB and the US Gov't involvement/MKULTRA.
   </p>
   <p>
    Also, there is a NEW book by a guy named Vinson, titled 'Confessions of a DC Madam', which talks about how he got roped in/blackmailed while in DC during that time, and how corrupt and evil the SECRET SERVICE(!!??) is, as they were involved in the coverup of the Franklin Scandal in DC.
   </p>
   <p>
    Buy the book!  It's on Amazon...the guy put his life on the line to write this, because he has been harassed by the US Gov't for the last 30 years!  Railroaded into prison TWICE on false charges...
   </p>
   <p>
    If you read the book, it's downright scary what this gov't does to people...if you get caught up in the 'system', and they want to destroy you...they WILL destroy you.
   </p>
   <p>
    EDITED to add: And the info in the book about the Secret Service is beyond disturbing.  These are the same people tasked with PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT!  Donald has numerous snakes in the grass around him and must be very careful.  Anyone who has looked into the JFK assassination, KNOWS that the Secret Service was neck deep in that op.  Including changing his limo route the day of the assassination right into the belly of the beast, and ordering the SS detail protecting Kennedy to stay back from his car.  There's even a video of a SS agent complaining to the Director of the SS that morning at the airport when told what to do/not do...
   </p>

    Evil bastards.

      he definitely has a no messing around drug policy.  I remember reading somewhere that USA was angry with him for blocking certain trading which was assumed related to smuggling drugs into the phillipines.  I can't remember where I read it.  But it kind of falls inline with these world leaders like Putin actively trying to separate themselves from the west.
