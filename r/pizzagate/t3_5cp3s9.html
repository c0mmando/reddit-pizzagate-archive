        <p><p>Matt Hollamby is a lover of James Alefantis.
Matt is the programs director at the Wyss Foundation.</p>
<p>The Wyss foundation is a nonprofit that promotes conservation and environmental causes. They fund national parks, encourage people to go outdooring, buy forests....etc</p>
<p>They also fund a significant number of shelters. Womens shelters, domestic violence shelter, AND homes for runaway and homeless children.</p>
<p>It might be nothing, but I think it's worth looking into. </p>
<p>The List of Donations page is here:
http://wyssfoundation.org/philanthropy/2015-grants/</p>
<p><strong>CAN YOU GUYS HELP GOOGLE THE DONATION RECIPIENTS TO DETERMINE WHICH ONES ARE SHELTERS?</strong></p>
<p>Once we parse out all the shelters, we can look into them individually and scour the news for anything fishy.</p></p>

        <p><p><strong>There are ALOT of childrens and womens shelters on this list. some of them look more legit than others. Here's some organizations I confirmed to be shelters</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abby Kelley Foster House Inc</strong>
Shelter for homeless women and children. High volume. 11k people since 1979</p>
<p><strong>Asociatia de Vanatoare Piatra Craiului Fagaras Conservation</strong>
This does not appear to be a legitimate association</p>
<p><strong>Attention Inc</strong>
A series of homes for runaway children. Something seems odd about this place. </p>
<p><strong>Bridge Fund of Massachuesetts</strong>
Low cost day care and childcare for low income and crisis families. </p>
<p><strong>Camp Dreamcatcher</strong>
Retreat for kids with aids. </p>
<p><strong>Carriage Town Ministries</strong>
Shelter for homeless men, women and children</p>
<p><strong>Casa Myrna Vasquez Inc</strong>
Domestic violence resource center. </p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Stone House Inc</strong>
  Transitional flop house for homeless women and children</p>
<p><strong>On The Rise Inc</strong>
Another womens shelter</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvannia Home of the Sparrow</strong>
This is a series of homes for women and children, there’s something odd about this too. The site looks like a template site with all stock photos. The fb page is all pics of room interiors</p></p>

        <p><p>Okay I'm just going to drop this incomplete rabbit hole here.</p>
<h1>In case someone can connect the dots</h1>
<h2><em>Note, there are no lines connecting dots so please don't bother these people !  Right now they're just coincidences.</em></h2>
<p>There's a man named Joel Fleischman who lives in Brooklyn and has a warehouse with a loading dock in walking distance to a house. We'll call him <strong>Brooklyn Joel</strong>. Old Joel's fax number -- in Brooklyn -- is a Seattle number.</p>
<p>There's another <a href="https://joelfleischman.com/">Joel Fleishman</a> in Wisconsin, who has his own building company, <a href="http://www.drexelteam.com/">The Drexel Team</a> aka "Team Blue" . We'll call him <strong>Wisconsin Joel</strong>. Everything looks on the up and up, but now that I got that link for you, I just noticed the moon and the stars on the splash page.</p>
<p>Can you read the tiny print at the bottom of their page about WOW being a registered trademark? It links to <a href="http://www.mathewsbrothers.com/News/History.aspx">The Mathews Brothers Windows in Maine</a>. Their logo has an M inside an unfinished triangle.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Wisconsin Joel's employees <a href="http://www.drexelteam.com/team.html"><strong>really like their pizza!</strong></a>. Maybe it's a Wisconsin thing, because, you know, cheese.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Meet James aka JJ- When not working you can find him on the dirt track racing. Enjoys the outdoors and listening to Jason Aldean - As long as there's pizza count him in!! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This spunky, fun gal carries nothing but an energetic spark around with her. She loves her dog and being outdoors, specifically in Winter when she stays busy Sturgeon Spearing! With the stress of finishing her marketing degree at Marian, there's nothing that a big slice of Veggie pizza can't fix for her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Living by the motto, "Tomorrow is a new day". She loves hanging out with her family and taking her kids out to dinner - pizza or chicken nuggets, count her in! Not a fan of Justin Bieber, but at least she likes the Packers and Badgers! </p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1>Going back to the WOW Trademark and window company in MAINE: There's not much to see besides their triangle logo.</h1>
<p><strong>But just for fun,</strong> I searched the town's name + PORN and found <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/amber-cummings-avoids-prison-for-killing-nazi-husband-while-he-slept/">a wife who shot her kiddie-porn-addicted and Nazi husband before he could bomb Obama</a>. Any relation to Scott Cummings, the Penrose Triangle sculptor?</p>
<h1>I don't know, but <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/The_%22dirty_bomb%22_that_disappeared"><strong>Julian Assange</strong> wrote about him.</a></h1>
<hr>
<h2>There are a lot of Joel Fleischmans, including the nice jewish doctor in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Northern_Exposure_characters">Northern Exposure</a></h2>
<p>There IS even a fourth Joel Fleishman (no C) in the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=Joel+Fleischman&amp;mfrom=&amp;mto=&amp;title=&amp;notitle=&amp;date_from=&amp;date_to=&amp;nofrom=&amp;noto=&amp;count=200&amp;sort=6#searchresult">Podesta emails</a>.  We'll call him <strong>Professor Joel</strong>, since he teaches at <a href="https://law.duke.edu/fac/fleishman/">Duke</a>. Professor Joel authored a book <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-58648-411-8">The Foundation: A Great American Secret: How Private Wealth Is Changing the World</a> in which he discusses the Carnegies, Bill Gates, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Milken"><strong>Michael Milken</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Milken, known as the "junk bond king" was indicted for racketeering and securities fraud, when he was working at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drexel_Burnham_Lambert"><strong>Drexel</strong> Burnham Lambert</a> in New York. One of the founding members there was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Martin_Drexel">Martin Drexel</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I can't for the life of me</em> connect these people to <a href="http://www.drexelheritage.com/About-Drexel-Heritage/">Drexel Heritage</a> which filed for bankruptcy and  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritage_Home_Group">closed its doors in 2014</a>.  How did <em>Wisconsin Joel</em> come up with the lumber name? Coincidence? And isn't it a coincidence Wisconsin Joel Fleischman works with lumber and building, while Brooklyn Joel works in shipping and has a warehouse?</p>
<p>And if that doesn't irritate you, there's a lot of <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/?q=drexel">Drexel shuffling around</a> while Kissinger was Secretary of State, including VP <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~ncburketp/obits/jackmilroysampson.htm">travelling Jack Sampson</a>. Jack was born in MA, lived in WI, and died in NC at the ripe old age of 95.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Thus ends my incomplete circle.</h1>
<p>The Drexels aren't related to one another, they just have a bunch of coincidences connected to them like the pizza-eating Drexel Team in Wisconsin, the bank Milken left and Professor Fleishman wrote about. And traveling Jack Sampson, VP of Drexel Heritage, rest in peace.</p></p>
