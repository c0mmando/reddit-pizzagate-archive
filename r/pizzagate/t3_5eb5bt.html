<strong>Questions for former worker at Comet Pizza</strong>
<p><p>I live in the friendship heights area and will be seeing a friend who is back in town this weekend who used to be a low level at Comet Ping Pong (think it was a few year ago now). Do y'all have any questions I should ask him more specific than if he saw kids getting abused?</p>
<p>On a related note, Besta Pizza has a second location in Bethesda, MD which just sent us a mailer with the original questionable logo. I'll post a picture of it when I get home</p>
<p>Edit: seeing him Thursday morning so will post responses that night or friday</p></p>

<p><p>Was he familiar with the Instagram posts?   He think it was just sick joking or something worse?</p>
<p>Did he ever go into the rooms below the shop?</p>
<p>Why is the owner one of the Top 50 most powerful men in Washington D.C. if he's just a guy throwing pizza dough all day?</p></p>

<p><p>How much time does Alefantis spend at Comet? I think this is important because we know he has his hands dipped in many things and if he spent a lot of time at Comet i think that only raises suspicions - it's hardly his main source of income.</p></p>

<p><p>Wow, you're right. I hadn't thought about how strange that is. It's one thing if he owns it and sometimes has fundraisers there, but if he's there frequently, that's really weird. Maybe he just really likes managing/cooking, but if he spends all his time doing that, then how did he manage to get to be one of the most important people in DC? (That question would be on the premise that he does spend significant time there)</p>
<p>Also a little unexpected that someone so important would own such a casual, family-style joint rather than a fancy upscale restaurant. Do he and his friends just enjoy pretending to be one of the plebs? That's not usually the impression I get from big name politicians. For a minute I was thinking that I suppose whatever he's doing at Comet, he could also be getting away with just as easily in an upscale restaurant. But then I remembered people never bring/see kids at those places. Still a fact more on the side of "unusual" rather than "guilty", but it's one more little factor.</p></p>

<p><p>Did he feel there were more than one group of people working there? People like him doing the dishes and others running the place, and then an other group who were regulars/ familiar faces, but with no immediate business.</p></p>

<p><p>I think many people who've worked at restaurants, myself included, can attest that walk-in freezers are pretty large.  That one in particular concerns me less than other info going around.</p></p>

<p><p>Well, you basically ousted your friend so... What i'd advise next for your friends safety and for this subreddit...</p>
<p>Have your friend pull up his bank records and take a picture of comet ping pong paying him his wages so we know this is legit. Whether or not he wants to include his/her name is up to them. Post an AMA and we'll get that shit archived. If anything happens to them we'll make sure it spreads like wildfire.</p></p>

<p><p>It's now or never OP. You have what we do not, direct connections. If it's damning enough you have the entire support and backing of Trump supporters and the rest of the decent humans who voted Hillary because they thought she was the lesser evil. Pretty sure if it's damning enough and is a slam dunk, ex-vet type of people will come to your defense if needed.</p>
<p>But i'm just an anonymous internet person who wants justice for crimes if they were committed. Think for yourself on your own safety and if it is worth it to you.</p></p>

<p><p>-Does Comet Pizza looked like a sustainable business or a cover for something sinister? I looked at yelp reviews of that restaurant and a lot of people were saying the service was awful, like they don't really care about losing clients.<br/>
-Is there more secret chambers like the bathrooms?  </p></p>

<p><p>I agree with what /u/conspExec said. We need definitive proof that your friend really did work there. With all this talk of LARPers and "lack of proof" we need to do everything we can to make sure we have real evidence here and not just anecdotes. </p></p>

<p><ul>
<li>What was his relationship with Alefantis ? How was he with his employees ? Any sudden change in his mood ?</li>
<li>Was he talking about his private sex life in public (He seems to have an activ sexual life) ?</li>
<li>Was he able to move everywhere in Comet ? Some area were restricted ? If yes, were they heavily protected ?</li>

<p><p>Was the restaurant ever closed for extended periods of time outside of holidays? If so, what reasons did they give? </p>
<p>Did they host private parties?</p>
<p>Who were the regular customers? Anyone stand out as displaying strange behavior?</p></p>

<p><p>I live sort of near there and I can tell you right now they definitly close for private events. I'll ask if he worked any of them though</p></p>

<p><p>Closing for private events in itself isn't suspicious, given that he's an important person and holds fundraisers there. Although if your friend knows anything more about those events, that would be helpful.</p>
<p>Closing for extended periods of time could indicate construction or something.</p></p>

<p><p>Was he aware of many "after hours shows" or anything like that?</p>
<p>Were there ever different children around the owners? like rotating children basically?</p>
<p>Show him the carisjames photo and other suspect photos, familiar?</p>
<p>However I think the most important thing I want to know, is was he at all aware of the kill room?</p></p>

<p><p>you can ask if there actually are customers that are deeply interested in contents of the food in detail. such as, do people often come and say:</p>
<p>"hey, this pasta with walnut sauce? are you sure it is a good choice to play dominoes on?"</p>
<p>or, do people ask him about further details of their food:</p>
<p>"hey man, the restaurant you work was claiming to add a new haiti cheese to one of their pizzas. i am very busy and cannot eat it before end of this month, but please tell me, how was it? is haiti cheese on new pizza really that good?"</p>
<p>such sort of questions seem extremely unreal to me.</p></p>

<p><p>Livestream with him/her on Periscope or something and link it here when you actually see him/her so we can post questions and get answers in real-time.
Otherwise this is mostly just a LARP.</p></p>

<p><p>Does he have a special "client list" for his after blue parties? </p>
<p>Is there any other pizzeria in the area that the same high end customers go to? </p>
<p>Could you tell him and his clients had a baby obsession? I saw on one of his party event flyers, they were giving everyone who attended "comet swag, baby onesies" </p></p>
