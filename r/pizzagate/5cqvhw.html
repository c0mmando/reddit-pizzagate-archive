    Ok putting on my tinfoil hat here, no shill.  I'm on mobile so no links.

    Remember the theory that Podesta may have been involved in Scalia's death?  The email about the Inez movie with the link to a US map with Poindexter's place highlighted (where Scalia died).
   </p>

    Where was that image located?
    <strong>
     On the smithsonian website

    Looking up the details of his death at the time, it wasn't enough to make anything clear.  Very lacking in specifics.  But it did mention a group of 30-ish people...
