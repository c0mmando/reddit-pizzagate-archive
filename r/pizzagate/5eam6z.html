     So glad that we got to see both of you after quite a while.
It was great to be with Tony so close to his 72nd..
Attached are pictures that capture some of the spirit of the evening - at a couple of different levels.
Warm Regards - and hope we see you again soon.

    <em>
     side note: This has an interesting picture of the pope in the attachments
    </em>
    I looked up who this was coming from (Amrita &amp; Ashok Mahbubani) and they are the president and founder of Multitronics, Inc.
    <strong>
     But,
    </strong>
    what is more interesting is this: http://www.ektafoundationusa.org/main/
They are also the founders of EKTA which is funded by the
    <em>
     "Clinton Global Initiative"
    </em>
    and
    <em>
     "In their path to the present, the Mahbubanis developed a bond with Haiti, through a family owned manufacturing business that employed 300 people there in the '80s."
    </em>

    Could I have found something new or am I barking up the wrong tree?

    The EKTA founders were later convicted of cocaine smuggling and money laundering.    There's a thread on it in this sub.

     You follow every lead until you are sure it's a dead end or the truth. Otherwise you miss important things.

     Of course it would be impossible to have the time to do this alone, which is why crowd sourcing investigations is so effective.

    Thank you for bringing this up. The subject of Amrita and Ashok Mahbubani of Huntsville, Alabama, deserves far greater attention and study, I think.
   </p>
   <p>
    They were ubiquitous in the Tony Podesta dinner circle and Amrita cooked an elaborate Indian dinner at his house with an extensive menu which required the use a of a pizza oven. "Fresh, sweet mango" was for offered for dessert.
   </p>
   <p>
    https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9735
   </p>
   <p>
    Amrita planned to go to the Costco in Fairfax, VA, to shop for the fish/meats:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Amrita typically shops for fish/meats here at Costco where she knows where to find what she wants. I see the closest one is at 1200 South Fern Street, Arlington, VA 22202 Maybe you have a preferred place closer to home that you could suggest?
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    What do we know about Costco? Is it possible it could be a warehouse for human trafficking?

     I noticed that - before the thread got deleted. I assumed costco was code for buying/selling kids in whatever manner they are doing that. I wouldn't think it would be literally costco as these people are... to "elite" for that, just like they are too elite for real hot dog stands in Hawaii or anywhere else.

      The only thing I can think of about Costco is that they are very large facilities and semi-trucks can be unloaded and loaded in a very inconspicuous manner.
     </p>
     <p>
      The human merchandise, for instance, could be loaded in one of the warehouses in the Caracol-Ekam industrial park into a USAID shipping container and taken to the nearby airport in Cap-Haitien and flown anywhere in the world, unloaded and sent to any number of stores.
     </p>
     <p>
      The garment factory in Caracol was ostensibly shipping products to Gap, Target, Walmart and other stores in the U.S. Costco could hypothetically be one of the stores in an international pipeline of human trafficking.
     </p>

     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Nearly three years after the project was announced, the park still has just one major tenant: Sae-A Trading Co. Ltd., a Seoul-based textile giant that supplies Wal-mart, Gap, Target and others.

     More about the EKTA Foundation from their website:
    </p>
    <p>
     "In their path to the present, the Mahbubanis developed a bond with Haiti, through a family owned manufacturing business that employed 300 people there in the '80s. In this, the poorest country in our hemispehere, the EKTA Foundations has made measurable impact working with stellar partners - the Haitian Education &amp; Leadership Program (HELP), Inveneo and Water.org - to change ground realities for the better. Perhaps more fulfilling is the experience of seeing Haitians at all levels strive to take charge of their destiny, directing their irrepressible spirit to rebuild their country as they find their new place in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
     BTW, the Mahbubani's EKTA Foundation donated between $500,00 and $1,000,000 to the Cllinton Foundation

      Speaking of EKTA, the Mahbubani's foundation, the word "ekta" is defined on their website as Hindi noun (pronounced ayk-tha): a purposeful unity; solidarity; a melding of people in pursuit of a common cause.
     </p>
     <p>
      The funny thing is that "Ekam", the name for the housing in Caracol, is also a Hindu word, meaning "the supreme oneness."

      <p>
       Just looking up the origins of the word "Ekam" and found something VERY interesting. The temple of the Hindu supreme god, the Lord Shiva, is "Ekambaram", or "Lord of the Mango Tree".
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the Caracol-EKAM housing project which Monica Petersen was investigating has an interesting connection to the mango tree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the mysterious email from Cheryl Mills to Hillary Clinton where mango trees are discussed:
      </p>
      <p>
       https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/19339
"Only two mango trees had to be uprooted at the Caracol Park. Trees under threat are now being transplanted to the Caracol Ekam housing."
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, this could all be totally innocuous; hypothetically, however, is it possible that Amrita and Ashok Mahbubani who operate a charitable foundation in Haiti,the EKTA foundation (another Hindu word), have a close connection with the EKAM housing project?
      </p>
      <p>
       And is it possible that "mango tree" means temporary housing for children ("mangos") in the Caracol-Ekam housing project who are about to be passed into the international pipeline--- stowed away in USAID shipping containers in the Caracol factory warehouses and delivered to the nearby Cap-Haitien airport for transport around the globe?

    It's a cardboard cutout of the pope. The same pope cutout was on the jimmy Comet IG, along with Tony Podesta wearing the same shirt.
