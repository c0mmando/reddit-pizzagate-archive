    Should we reach out and start contacting these people? It may help to have some big names on our side.

      I don't know, but even if she does she probably only had it for an AMA and doesn't check it. It would be best to contact her through her agent.

    And don't forget what Putin did in retaliation for US sanctions on Russian officials. He BANNED Americans from adopting orphans! Coincidence? Why do you think Trump is trying to talk with him?

     Yeah, guy I know adopted his kid from Russia right before the ban was instituted. They were making it really complicated for Americans to adopt kids even before Putin signed the ban.

      Isnt the ban because of a crazy american woman who adopted a child returned him several years later because he had social and mental problems that she gave up on trying to help him?

       I'd be really surprised if an entire country changed their adoption policy over a single incident.

    This is kind of the impression I get. I spent a fair bit of time digging through Podesta's facebook the other day and all I found were DC reporters, some politicians, lobbyists galore, and a lot of "grandparents" with lots of "grandkids". Whether they truly are grandparents or not couldn't be determined. However, they all seemed quite young to have a dozen grandkids.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm thinking some of these may go up for adoption because of the whole, "babies having babies" epidemic in America. Teen sex is rampant and children result. Maybe some are raised by grandma and grandpa, but others may very well go up for adoption.
   </p>
   <p>
    It's likely this is a main source for their orphanages. Hell, some of these people could be foster parents and if they had a personality test that could determine a child's potential for programming, they may just keep the ones who fail and
    <em>
     actually
    </em>
    foster them, while the ones who pass go to the "orphanage".
   </p>
   <p>
    If you gave up a baby, you wouldn't want to visit and confuse the child. Let the adopted parents make a strong bond so the kid isn't constantly saying shit like, "You're not my real mom!". So, for those kids given up that way, the "orphanage" could be confident that no one will come looking for the kid. They tell the biologicals, "Little Sarah was adopted by a nice young couple from DC! They're into politics, so Sarah should be very well off."

     Horrifying thought, but I bet you're right. I bet the shortage of babies to adopt is artificial. Most are going into the abuse pipeline. That is terrifying.

    There is a direct link to an orphanage in this scandal - the owner/admin owner (via Whois) of Besta Pizza (The whois was being updated a few days ago though). He's the same guy who owns an orphanage with an address registered within miles of Comet/Besta. The posts got deleted after he came on here and got the moderator to delete the thread. This is real.

    its also interesting that Elijah Wood spoke out against Child Trafficking and now we have the person who made his career retweeting about this topic. Perhaps she sort of shielded him from this shit in the industry?

     I'd forgotten about that. We should dig up Elijah Wood's info on this -- kind of build a case over the next few days.

      It finally sank in. This is the same site that met with Snowden before the NSA leaks were released. 2017 is going to actually be the year when the Internet uncovers a child sex trafficking ring.

    Portugal had a huge scandal back in 2008. They were assaulting children in a well known orphanage near Lisbon. It had been going on for years and years but nobody said anything for the longest time.

    Condensed version of the  interview - focused on Haiti because of known Clinton Foundation ties.

   <p>

     Full Article Here

   <blockquote>
    <p>
     [...]
     <strong>
      Research clearly shows that 80% or more of these children have at least one living parent.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     In
     <strong>
      Haiti
     </strong>
     , for example, we found that because foreigners love giving
     <strong>
      some foreigners coming to Haiti, are setting up orphanages simply to access that money
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The conditions in probably two thirds of these orphanages are appalling.  These are children who have no access to clean water, and have very little access to medical care and often are not receiving any education.
     <strong>
      From what we are told, these are children who are often being beaten, sexually abused
     </strong>
     , [...] All of this to enable unscrupulous people to
     <strong>
      raise money on the backs of children who should not be in orphanages in the first place.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     [...] An orphanage sets-up near a town and then
     <strong>
      child finders (yes, that’s what they actually call them) are paid (usually on a per-child basis) to aggressively recruit parents in the community with the false promise that by giving up their children, their child will receive better education, nutrition and healthcare.
     </strong>
     [...]  The child finder then
     <strong>
      gives these parents a false  address
     </strong>
     for the orphanage so they can’t find their children again. Then they will
     <strong>
      deliberately malnourish the children
     </strong>
     to get better images of emaciated kids to raise more money.
    </p>
    <p>
     [...]
     <strong>
      People will often come to orphanages for help (not to give-up their children).
     </strong>
     [...]
    </p>
    <p>
     Let me be clear, this is child-trafficking funded inadvertently by well-intended donors who think they’re actually giving to orphanages.

    This story from Australia's 60 Minutes deals with a British child-sex ring, and it too gathered many of its victims from orphanages and similar places. (edit) Doh! Forgot link! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfNeB6Hx7N0
