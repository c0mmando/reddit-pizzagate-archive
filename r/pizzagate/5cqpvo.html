    Wanted to share a thought I had regarding the Heavy Breathing "Airtight" video
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    First and foremost, I searched this sub and this video was posted 2 days ago, but no one commented what I had noticed when I first watched this video last night.
   </p>
   <p>
    https://youtu.be/N_gGhrIO6ps?t=3m25s
   </p>
   <p>
    Apart from the voice and the overly obvious euphemisms, I feel like this video is referencing some sort of streaming service and/or a delivery service for Heavy Breathing's album "Airtight." Now, one part of this video that shook me was commentary about the radius of distance they can "send" their album too.
   </p>
   <p>
    Did anyone else notice this? Any thoughts towards this "streaming."  Some things from the video that really made me raise my eye brow were "
    <em>
     ...about 15 minutes in length
    </em>
    "(why wouldn't they know the length to their own album??) and of course, the pictures used in the video.
   </p>
   <p>
    I used a throwaway account, sorry for any grammatical errors, I just wanted to get what I noticed out to this sub. I do not want to immediately jump and say this video is advertising CP, this video is just really disturbing to me, along with the rest of the Heavy Breathing videos I watched.

    They are talking about their show not a album with the radius. The 15 minute thing is about a personal record based on your email. Have you even watched the video?

    I just wanted to add a few more thoughts.
   </p>
   <p>
    This band seems like of the many "hipster" bands that I'm sure you'll find all over, in any place. You can take this video as a "left-field-edgyness" kind of thing.
   </p>
   <p>
    To me though, this video seems to be like an
    <em>
     update
    </em>
    and I noticed that there seems to be one of the videos a year. (Again, they are band, they are just promoting themselves... right?).
