<strong>Cheerleading! Spread the word, but break them in easy and wisely.</strong>
<p><p>I feel like we need to reach out to friends, family, colleagues in safe and discreet ways.  Let them know about the strange things in DC focusing on the pedoring, not as much occult (for now).  Show them easy leads.  </p>
<p>It will be uncomfortable, but I'm sure you know a few people who might take interest, if they are ready to dig.</p></p>

<p><p>I've been telling my friends and family for like 15+ years that we are being ruled by an elite group of child molesters. People don't like uncomfortable realities even when the evidence is undeniable. </p></p>

<p><p>This type of story is on the level of E.T. disclosure.  The topic is just too uncomfortable for people. Makes it feel like you are living in the matrix. For decades no one has paid attention to these conspiracy theories because they are so bizarre, to say the least. The level of mass cognitive dissonance that would take place is similar to that of having a close family member accused of pedo. I've known victims (not related to this scandal) and when people find out, they'd rather pretend it didn't happen, so they don't acknowledge it, it's just too much too handle.</p></p>
