        <p><p>Has anyone seen a simple "explain this to my parents" summary that is an easy at to explain this whole pedo thing?  Every time I try to inform someone I stumble and sound like a lunatic. </p></p>

        <p><p>Have them watch the documentary "Who Took Johnny?" A short little intro into child abduction and human trafficking in the US, it will make them more open to the idea of Pizzagate.</p></p>

        <p><p>Start with Jeffrey Epstein. I introduce people to it by mentioning the whole rape accusation with Trump and the fact that it was supposedly at an Epstein party with Epstein as the main perpetrator, and that he has a reputation for being a pedo. Then I bring up the fact that the first time Epstein's name hit msm was after Bill Clinton took "The Lolita Express," to Africa. </p>
<p>Epstein being into kids is a mainstream rumour, and he has verifiable ties to a fuck ton of important people. Good place to wade into it without getting too nuts. </p></p>
