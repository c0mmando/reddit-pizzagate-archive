<strong>GTA V, released in 2013, has a main character who makes an odd reference to pizza! Possible prediction/click bait?</strong>
<p><p>I gave up playing GTA V for a while due to this damn mission where I kept failing to land the plane after the Chinese kidnap Michael. So after replaying the mission today after some time a particular line of dialogue jumped out at me. </p>
<p>On this particular mission Michael says to Trevor on the phone </p>
<p>Michael De Santa: Come back, we'll order pizza. 
Trevor Philips: Fuck you! Fuck your pizza. Fuck everything it stands for! </p>
<p>It sounds innocuous but remember, Trevor is quite the conspiracy theorist in-game and causes chaos for the establishment. Just something I noticed which I'd thought I'd share as we all wait to see what happens with this nasty business.</p></p>

<p><p>I think the only odd quote is the "fuck everything it stands for." To me, that's a little out of context. From everything we know about movies/games predicting stuff, and the whole, truth is stranger than fiction notion, I don't think it's completely out of reach. </p></p>

<p><p>Interesting catch, esp considering Trevor made many conspiracy theory comments.  Might be on to something, gosh I hope Trump does the right thing and legitimately investigates these people with transparency.</p>
<p>Btw there's some videos that guide you through landing.  You basically have to land with a really slow speed, it's not like real life the planes flying characteristics are totally unreal.</p></p>

<p><p>Maybe you think this just something silly and trivial but in reality it really highlights how dramatically our perceptions of something can change, how something so good can immediately bring to mind disgust. This is a good example of that and I will never look at pizza the same way again. #rippizza</p></p>

<p><p>If other people already knew "cheese pizza" was common substitute for "child porn" years ago on the Internet, I wouldn't be surprised if creators of games knew it too.</p>
<p>I never knew cheese pizza was pretty much synonymous with child porn til now. And yes, I will never think of ordering pizza the same.</p></p>
