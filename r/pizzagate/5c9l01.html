   <strong>
    Hospital abuse victim-- How to proceed?
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I had an interesting chat with a friend of mine. He just opened up to me about some of the sexual abuse he endured when he was younger.
   </p>
   <p>
    He grew up in Chicago has been in and out of the hospital since he was 3 years old with heart issues. He told me of a care unit for children in one particular hospital. Apparently, only a handful of doctors allowed in the unit, and he wasn't permitted to go to the recreational areas in the main hospital without a chaperone, (even when he was well). His mother was a pill head and alcoholic. His dad, in a wheelchair and in terrible health. So they didn't visit him. His room mates were boys his age and also had little to no visitors. 
Here's where it gets scary.
He said that doctors would drug the boys at night and carry them outside into a van. There would be 4-6 of them at a time. 
He broke down because he couldn't remember what took place. Just that he would wake up 'sore' in bed the next morning. 
He was in and out for months at a time at this particular hospital from ages 3-7. He doesn't want me posting his name (which I understand) or the name of the hospital (which I don't understand)
   </p>
   <p>
    He opened up to me about this when I was showing him this sub. I had no idea about any of this until today, I just knew he was in the hospital a lot as a kid. (He now has a pacemaker)
   </p>
   <p>
    This just goes to show that we need to spread the word. There are a lot of victims out there. I am going to do some digging on this.
   </p>
   <p>
    One more thing, how can I convince him to give more info? Names, locations, etc? He is very uncomfortable talking about it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit: Seeing him Monday for lunch! Will update, trying to get a video.

    Your friend is probably dissociative if he underwent that kind of trauma. If you want more information from him i suggest gaining the trust of his alter parts. Very likely they are small children and one or more aggressive protector that might not want to talk much but if they trust and respect you, you have a chance of hearing the whole story. It's really hard for some alters to talk. They're terrified, and with good reason. They were created in the darkest world you can imagine.

    Getting him to open up is definitely a trust issue and nothing personal towards you, that's his survival mechanisms in play.
   </p>

    How to proceed is a bit more difficult. There are several routes to take, but they depend on the circumstances. These types of things make a difference: How long ago has this been? Is it likely or possible this is still going on in this particular hospital? What type of institution was is, profit or nonprofit, religiously or secularly affiliated?
   </p>
   <p>
    That being said, I work rather high up in a large hospital. There ARE options for pursing this.

     The last incident happened about 30 years ago... :/
    </p>
    <p>
     And I never thought to ask about the type of institution it is. I will ask him when I see him.

     He is chewing over the idea of doing an interview, as long as his identity is hidden. After reading on this sub, he feels compelled to help children who may be experiencing similar situations. He wasn't aware that it was so widespread and thought he was alone in this. As far as trying to seek justice for himself, he isn't interested. He doesn't want anyone knocking on his door with a camera. Understandable.

      Yes absolutely understandable from his point, camera and publicity at this point would only bring up the harsh reality of the past and unfortunately justice for himself would be bittersweet. An interview many be helpful in bringing things to light as well as give him a sense of resolution.
     </p>

      Unfortunately hospital's like any other business tend to stick with practices they have found "acceptable" meaning they got away with it, chances are the practice has been handed down to the newer staff even though this was 30 years ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      As I said, working in a large teaching hospital, unacceptable things like this get swept under the rug all to often. I see it (not this exactly of course) even in the Catholic Non-profit I'm currently at.

    This is 100% it. These are the children they prey upon, those w/o families, or parents, or anyone who will come looking.  Keep him anonymous.  Keep him safe.
