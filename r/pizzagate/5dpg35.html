   <strong>
    The Biggest Threat To Pizzagate
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Whilst we are uncovering more and more damning evidence to the crimes of these fuckers, we run the risk of it all being buried to the ground in a single way:
   </p>
   <p>
    If Podesta pays his minions for a fake alibi for the Madeline Mccann, they can run this on TV and paint the image that Pizzagate is bollocks, while ignoring the other incriminating matters revolving around and leave the impression that this is just about some pizza joint conspiracy. Afterwards they may work toether to exterminate Reddit and all forms of free speech online at all costs. We need to make the new discoveries apparent too:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Amanda Kleinman Videos
    </li>
    <li>
     Suicide of Monica Petersen and witness testimony of boss
    </li>
    <li>
     Haiti Child Trafficking and Clinton Foundation
    </li>
    <li>
     Laura Silsby
    </li>
    <li>
     Possibly Indian child trafficking
    </li>
    <li>
     And lots more.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <hr/>
   <p>
    I also think, they're going to launch a guerilla attack sometime soon. It's really gotten to a point of no return. They've exterminated people, and even killed someone a few days ago. They're going to do everything in their power to exterminate this. I think they'll either do it one way or another: destroy, or subjugate. Maybe they'll upvote all Maddie threads and fill the first three pages with Mccann and Satan posters or something. Is Reddit capable of defending from that?

    We also need to keep in mind the other sides (shillls, ctr..) next phase in this subreddit.
   </p>
   <p>
    -At the beginning they shit posted as much garbage as possible to confuse,
   </p>
   <p>
    -next came the divide and conquer, they tried to make it about Politics (left vs right) Religion, Satanism etc
   </p>
   <p>
    -then came in some damage control from minor players accused, obviously using every argumentative fallacy known to man trying to defend themselves.
   </p>
   <p>
    Next...im not sure. But if you pay attention you can start noticing patterns.
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit. If people start reading this some other immediate concerning points. Do we have any recent Julian Assange proof of life? I mean like him on his balcony in public..

     Assange last confirmed seen 15th of October. Last pgp signature signed document 16th (wish I had a source handy but I'm pretty sure that's right) His personal Twitter via his cat last posted Oct 15.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rt interview falls apart as evidence of his safety upon further inspection. (Very shady editing and unanswered question by assange. His director/mentor  Gavin died the weekend after the internet shutdown and all that ddos shit which happened 17 and 18 of October.
    </p>
    <p>
     You can find a more complete, correct and thourough timeline on other parts of reddit. (Sorry I don't have it handy)
    </p>
    <p>
     But yeah Assange is almost assuredly in custody or dead. There is other possibilities but my guess is that the chances of him being okay are extremely slim to none.

      Is it normal for him to be this quiet for a month at a time? Or is this the first time hes been silent for this long

       first time as far as I am aware.
      </p>
      <p>
       But more importantly, it's definitely the first time the hash pre-commitments haven't matched the realeased files. That was a huge red flag that set off a bunch of people on r/whereisassange r/the_donald and r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that the mods over on r/wikileaks are compromised. They were banning people and removing posts asking about the pgp key.

        I saw that. All of these things happening are just too coincidental, I feel like these are the early days of the single most important event in recent human history. I honestly think that TRUMP is the biggest unintended wrench thrown into the largest machine of corruption running today.

      They already do, but they have to disrupt this sub too. Mods on 4chan are already compromised, and they close all threads about it on /pol/

    All pedophiles are part of a pedo ring. Child porn is not easy to get. They join clubs where they have to upload shit to get accepted. Many go to Thailand to get original material for the club.
   </p>
   <p>
    How do I know this? A friends brother got busted with a laptop full of fresh kiddie porn at Canada customs. He was trying to get into exclusive clubs on the dark web. He won't see sunshine for a long time.

     I suspect a lot of this pedophile ring is about Child Pornography. I also suspect there is an alternate internet of some sort... Something DARPA created to house this disgusting filth..
My gut tells me when Podesta is emailing back and forth about the food he sent someone, he's talking about child porn.

    In terms of publicity, any publicity is good publicity.
   </p>
   <p>
    Let them try to discredit us and say on TV the word "pizzagate". See how many more subscribers we get. Saying on TV "don't look at this people it's so wrong and bad for you and please don't look at it" is always and everywhere counter-productive.
   </p>
   <p>
    When they move from ignoring us to overtly fighting us, we'll know it won't be long before they are exposed for their crimes.
