    Most disturbing passage from "the Franklin Cover-up" (warning: NSFL)
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm reading John DeCamp's
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Franklin-Cover-up-Satanism-Murder-Nebraska/dp/0963215809">
     "The Franklin Cover-up,"
    </a>
    which you all should check out, along with the documentary
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY-F5JoHoho">
     "Conspiracy of Silence."
    </a>
   </p>
   <p>
    This is the most disturbing passage I've come across so far in the book. Paul Bonacci is one of the child victims who came forth to tell his story about being abused by Republican big-wig Larry King. This guy is connected to George Bush Sr. by the way. Are they talking about THAT Hunter Thompson I wonder??

    Wish I hadn't read that.
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit: I also remember hearing that it was THAT Hunter Thompson. I can't remember which podcast, but they mentioned it either on The Corbett Report or episode 5 or 6 of the Sword and Scale podcast. They also mentioned that he was killed for trying to blackmail someone in this group rather than committing suicide.
   </p>
   <p>
    Edit 2: It was mentioned in episode 6 of the Sword and Scale podcast at around 29 minutes. They play an interview with Bonacci saying he was approached to make snuff films. He said Thompson was involved in making those snuff films as well and that he felt that Thompson's death was not a suicide.

     Thompson is known to have had a collection of snuff films. You don't get to be that fucked up and that famous unles you're in with the pedos too. He was not a good man

    Holy shit. Well deserved NSFL warning.
   </p>
   <p>
    Need to show this to /u/BeyondWikipedia who thinks this is "all a coincidence" and /u/VOICEOFREASONDC who claims a DC pedophile ring "just wouldn't be possible". Although I doubt it'll change their minds. Confronting worldview-altering material with a level head and open mind is asking a lot of people.

     I am not attempting to debunk all stories of occult abuse, however I really don't don't see any evidence of any restaurant in Washington DC being used as a cover for a sex trafficking operation.

      Is it really that far-fetched to think that the same satanic cult responsible for this, is also connected to Comet Ping Pong? In both cases, we have VERY high-up elites involved. And we know that the elites know each other and protect each other.

     Edit: to be more clear, if you look into the Franklin story with a level head you'll find that it's a well-known hoax and that Decamp is not credible.

    Can anyone explain to me how being satanic and being a pedophile aren't even close to normal human behavior, yet somehow every single politician and famous person are accused of being such things? What does becoming famous do to people that makes them have a craving to fuck children? The pattern people are claiming just makes zero sense.

     I can't remember where but I read that they do it for 3 reasons . 1) They want to show that they can trust eachother by participating in the most vile things imaginable. 2) They want to have dirt on eachother to prevent backstabbing. 3) They want to prove they are sadistic enough to do whatever it takes to rule.

     They aren't fucking boys because they're famous. They are the only people who wanted to be famous, and were willing to fuck boys instead of take a bullet to the head.

     It's what's called a blackmail ring.

      The quickest way to the top is on your knees, in this situation, it's possible that this little dark club is the "Cheat" to popularity, to partake in the devil's fruit and have all your dreams come true.
     </p>
     <p>
      Honestly does sound like some dark magic when you think of it like that. Yet when you consider how much you can do with a billion dollars, you could call it magic.

     It's not that people in power gain a taste for these sorts of things (which I'm sure some do), it's more that these types of people know they need to be in high places of power to get away with these evil deeds.

    It's known that hunter s thompson had a collection of snuff films. He snorted coke and watched porn all night every night like it was just background noise like the news or something.

     Yup, this is not a new revelation. His death came shortly after supposedly making this snuff film.

    Yes, that made me feel sick. The accuracy of that testimony considering the themes and such we are all dealing with it quite frightening.  Seems we are dealing with the same infection

    Warning: Do not read this. Just take our word for it--it's fucking horrible. Worst thing I have ever read. Even if, (BEST case scenario) it happens to be fiction, I'm going to be scarred from that mental image.

     Nah. Don't listen to this. Read it. Some of you don't really understand or don't really get what's really happening. Think about this every time you miss the opportunity to show someone this sub. Think about the kids and think about the authors words.

    I should probably ask this in its own thread, but did anyone ever get the "official" reason that it was taken off the air?  I cant remember ever hearing one

    Interesting you post this, I'm currently researching something and hunter s thompson came up in that too, i was already aware that he was named in the franklin case. Hopefully I'll post what I've got so far tonight.

    Edit: shit i had only seen the first image. Jesus that is the sickest shit i have ever heard.

    Rusty Nelson is a 'photographer' who worked for Larry King, was seemingly abused and then paid to recruit for him. There's an interview on Youtube, he says it is indeed the Hunter Thompson. Reckons Thompson was making snuff films and paying big money.
