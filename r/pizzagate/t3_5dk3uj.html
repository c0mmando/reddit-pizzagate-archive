        <p><p>Pathetic puff piece.  And privatizing child care is a disaster in the making--once you start paying PER child, you'll find kids disappearing by the thousands. Just look at what the Child Care Act put into law by Clinton.  See Georgia and Colorado and many other states for nightmares with children.</p>
<p>And Bush?  Well, gee. Daddy Bush likes em black and around 15-16 years old.  As stated in numerous books, including the Franklin Scandal and the Unauthorized Bio of George Bush.  Both available on Amazon.  And in print for years and never sued.</p>
<p>I expect our gov't to do the same to the Bushes as we demand done to the Clintons--they all need to be breaking up large rocks into smaller rocks.  End of story.  Bring down the Octopus...</p></p>
