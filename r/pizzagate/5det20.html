    One interesting theory is that the truly powerful -- Soros, Rothchild, and who knows who else -- choose perverts to put into "leadership" positions because their loyalty is guaranteed by blackmail, and they are easy to control.

    I think you are going about it the wrong way.
   </p>
   <p>
    Instead of thinking that 'World leaders want children' you should flip it around and think along the lines of 'People that want children are world leaders'. What I mean with that is that there is a network of pedophiles and this network has worked itself up into the most powerful positions in the world.
   </p>
   <p>
    Because politics really is nothing more than friends of friends, with the occasional exception (Trump for example) it is easy to put people from your network in places you want them and maintain a power structure which allows you to control investigation and opportunity at your leisure.
   </p>
   <p>
    So if you want my hypothesis;
   </p>
   <p>
    World leaders don't want children, pedophiles want to be world leaders for obvious reasons.
Don't think that this pizza-gate is exclusive to the US, there are more Western countries where high officials are linked with pedophilia but never investigated, because they are high officials (Witnesses gone missing/dying, evidence getting lost, Investigations halted for obscure reasons).

      I agree.  The man has a court date for his own child rape case, but he couldnt possibly be associated with pizzagate.

     I'm fine with the logic here and you've clearly made an excellent point. I guess the fault is upon me because I can't justify that as means to an end.

     Simply pfla and trafficking aren't the only interest. How is ones sexual appetite so vast and fucked up?  Am I being too stubborn?

      Being too stubborn? No, not IMO. This stuff still seems barely believable to me too. But then I remember cases like Jerry Sandusky and Anthony Weiner.  One built an entire charity just to have a private hunting ground. The other was caught three separate times, and each time it cost him big time: a career, his marriage (such as it was), and now maybe his freedom. Weiner wasn't (AFAIK) trafficking or even having physical contact, just sending pictures... but clearly his obsession, like Sandusky's, was indeed "vast and fucked up". And of course, these are just two recent, well-known examples.

    It may also be that a certain type of psychopathology -- that of the predator -- is better at achieving power. Bill Clinton, for example, can appear very charming and sincere to some, but also ready to pounce when someone vulnerable comes near. One thing to notice with Bill is that many or most of his victims were not enemies or strangers, but were supporters at the time. Even Monica Lewinsky was an intern, i.e. a subordinate. Because of the inequality of their relationship, she could not freely consent (that despite the fact that she turned out to be perfectly willing). In any case, the idea that the extremely power hungry (or fame hungry, or wealth hungry) are mentally ill isn't a new one.

    There are two major theories which go hand in hand here. One side is spirituality: Aleister Crowley wrote books on why children produce the purest energy from pain. And then blackmail for a compartmentalized hierarchy. The brotherhood kills many birds with a single stone.

    It is the most detestable crime, and the perfect blackmail. I know Mossad, not wanting to conduct ops in America for fear of damaging relations, instead had men set up high class escort agencies with mole prostitutes to blackmail and gain info. Epstein likely is a Mossad tool himself. Was it the rothschilds who talked about not being a politician, but controlling the politicians and the money. This is a guaranteed way.

     I agree. But is it a bearded god and horned demon we're looking for? Or is it just a spliced narrative where God and Satan represent something else? I have a hard time with the former being the answer. It isn't simple enough.

      The picture is far larger than just paedophilia. You won’t get a correct answer if you only analyse this from the angle of paedophilia. You know Soros is largely funding a lot of the people implicated. Take a step back, follow the money. The root of the problem are Zionists, usurping wealth and power for an agenda which they can't pursue out in the open. Religion is very much involved, but plenty of people in powerful roles either have a distorted view of religion, or are bought/blackmailed by someone who does.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paedophiles are attracted to positions of power, it can give them easier access to victim, and also would give them more believability/options when things go wrong. They're easy to blackmail too due to the grotesque nature of their crime, but once they see the system lets it go under the radar, and many big players are implicated, they will probably to whatever people like Soros ask of them, just as long as they can stay on the sick gravy train. The children are also used in rituals which aren't necessarily directly related to sexual desires, but rather have some sort of spiritual goal.

      EDIT: Actually i'm not too sure if Zionists are
      <em>
       the
      </em>
      root cause of it all, that's probably wrong, I don't know the true extent of who's actually incharge and what their ideologies are, but Zionists are at least part of the problem.

     Have you ever read anything about satanism (by non bullshit media)? Like how it has nothing to do with awkward rituals and praising satan? Most satanists are down to earth people who praise their ego over everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
     What you mean are cults, and not specifically satanism.

    It's easier to control and influence children. They probably get off on corrupting innocence.

     My personal theory on the satanic aspect is that they do the satanic rituals and use symbols to harm the credibility of anyone who speaks out against them. If you go around saying you saw a satanic cult ritual most people will just assume you are mentally ill.

     I guess I can buy into the last bit. There are refugee, black, Latino and definitely too many LGBT lawyers.

     Never heard of a kid lawyer.
