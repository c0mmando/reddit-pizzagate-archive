    Is it me, or have posts lately been a turn for the tinfoil?
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    I think there is definately something up, I think digging is important but this has really been taking a turn for the tinfoil lately.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not everything with a pizza, a kid eating a pizza, a shitty washed up 90's kid star making shitty pizza themed covers of velvet underground, and a triangle is 'evidence'. Not every clip from 90's shows is code for pedophilia.
   </p>
   <p>
    I fear this will suddenly take a turn for the unbelievable (as is with what evidence is in it already is pretty bonkers) if people keep up the tinfoil or too much focus of past child scandles whose major players are already defunct. I don't want this to become a witchhunt.
   </p>
   <p>
    Just my thoughts.

    It's not just you. Last night I went to bed scared having read all of this evidence about one of the most sickening conspiracies that I've ever heard of. I woke up this morning to check for new developments but now reading all the new posts is like watching a bunch of retarded kids chasing a balloon.

     Some of it is to be expected. When something big like this unravels you are gonna get some tinfoilers. What is strange is the amount of shitposting... I knew disinfo would play a part. I underestimated how successful it would be in making this all look like a 'lizard people' scheme.

      Disinfo is usually how such things unravel and fall apart. We'll see how this one plays out. For myself and my crew, we are holding onto valid data points and saving all incriminating evidence. We can't stop the sheep from being fed a story about it just being all a bunch of tinfoil.

       The people who are hunting the ring see through the shills, it's just a last effort trying to undermine the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are already silent groups organised in the background filtering and researching the leads, it's just a matter of time now. Keep digging.

      That is a good way to ease in to it.  We should attempt to create a coherent document that eases people in to the topic following this outline.

    Yup. It's been annoying me too.
   </p>
   <p>
    I guess it's attracting the hardcore conspiracy nuts with twisted logic that often makes no sense.
   </p>
   <p>
    Derailing which could be a very real thing with crazy illogical theories.
Like...every pizza place is not a pedo ring. People do actually eat pizza.
   </p>
   <p>
    A logo with a pizza on it, is most likely because it's a pizza joint.
   </p>
   <p>
    The pedo pizza logo is suspicious due to it being discovered AFTER the initial theory of a pedo ring, and it's location being so close. And then changing the logo afterwards.
   </p>
   <p>
    A kid eating a pizza is not suspicious in itself. A random email saying "nice" with a kid eating pizza IS suspicious.
   </p>
   <p>
    Basically, I'm getting tired of people just posting pizza logos and images and being like "this is so creepy!". I spose /pol/ is a better place for serious discussion without the whack jobs getting involved.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sorry if this offends anyone.

     Spirals too. Spirals are pretty basic geometric shapes, and there are plenty of reasons one might use them in a logo.

     If it's related to the Podestas we have "pizza related" discussions in wikileaks. That should be our reference point. If we can link something to wikileaks or the Podestas we have a strong case.  Symbol sightings and old videos are great and disturbing but I think that will be lost in the mix.
    </p>
    <p>
     The wikileaks - Podesta - comet ping pong - Soros Money - besta pizza - orphanage. All solid links that anyone can follow.

    <p>
     absolutely nothing suspicious about people finding out their logo is a pedo symbol and changing it. NOTHING.

      Aye, I was saying that is suspicious.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although if I was to look for another explanation, (I think it's important to look at things from another perspective)
They probably got a ton of messages / reviews about the pedo thing. Without knowing their logo matched a pedo symbol, they changed it. If my business unintentionally had a pedo logo, I'd probably change it too.
     </p>
     <p>
      Just another possibility, don't lynch me pls.

        No but for reals, I've put a ton of time and energy into this. I think it's important to question things, both ways. Not just accept everything as a conspiracy. Doesn't help anyone.

    I think they may be trying to plant "Satanic Panic" fever all over again... If there is a legitimate pedo ring, they'd want to make the whole thing look like a joke.
   </p>
   <p>
    What's more ridiculous than say your opponent is "literally Hitler"? Saying your opponent is "literally Satan", perhaps?

    And everybody is jumping to the conclusion that the entire world is run by pedophiles, I don't think there is enough evidence for that one.

      Within our leaders are obviously pedos. "The world is run by pedos" is still VERY far stretched.

    I think this is all planted humbo jumbo recently.
   </p>
   <p>
    I think we (not really me cause I havent uncovered anything) need to find a new place to document works and what not, then post official findings

    This is just a tactic they're using to desperately cover up. Saturating a legit investigative measure with diversionary rabbit holes and false leads, posting loony content to make us look guilty by association.
   </p>
   <p>
    Don't worry about it and don't get bogged down in it, intelligent readers know it only confirms they have something sinister to hide.

     That's a possibility, between that and people legitimately just desperately over-analyzing every detail, it's bound to happen. The sad thing I see is that a lot of it isn't getting challenged and gets more attention than other things with much more solid leads (but aren't as flashy).

    Now people are posting triangle shapes.
Kinda losing faith in this sub reddit.
   </p>
   <p>
    Whenever you question things posted, you're called a shill.
People post pizzas and triangles and spirals and try to loosely connect it to this ... THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.
   </p>
   <p>
    This sub exists because of the hard work of people who read the emails, found the connections, the locations, the meaning behind images.
   </p>
   <p>
    But now it's just become a god damn mess.
I guess it's upto me to get this sub back on track.

    It's all real man, just look at all the posts getting deleted. reddit.com/r/me_irl was literally openly trading children up until last night. Pedophilia is everywhere, their smokescreen is vanishing before our very own eyes.

       Lol, so every time pizza is mentioned by anyone, no matter the circumstance, its considered code for pedophilia. You do realize people eat pizza right? Who are these people? There is literally nothing here hinting at 'trading children'.

          The post had like 6000 upvotes and 1000 comments of people freakishly obsessing over the screencap too. Unfortunately it's now deleted almost as if they weren't talking about pizza.

        They scrubbed the entire subreddit overnight, it was obvious. The top post was a little kid and like 2000 people jizzing in their pants about what they would do with him. Second post was a literal trade for a kid. They've been doing this out in the open for a long time.

         No idea what you are trying to tell me. Your source is obviously bullshit and now you come with a random story without any further source? But well, not feed the trolls they say

          Lol their top post is https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/5c01fh/fellow_americans_its_going_to_be_okay_were_going/ right now. They've tried to normalize pedophilia and are now freaking out because their secret is out.

           Why did they delete the thread with the image I posted if it's trading a pizza for upvotes if it was innocent. HINT: that's not what innocent people do.

    Yes! Its so sad watching this going downhill so fast. I feel most posts now are only paranoid bullshit, drawing lines where there are non and accusing random people of molesting children.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is really one of the worst things i've seen on Reddit so far. It was a good idea, but obviously the community is the stupid for this.

    Tinfoil or Not, if there is a small chance of helping a child it is as least worth a quick look into.  I would rather be called crazy now and a hero later.

    Hey fellow redditors! Im very new here, but just wanted to say that I am cheering for you in what you are doing! Stay smart and cooperate. There is nothing they can do if you act smart together and use your skills. I just downloaded Tor and Express VPN!

     lol he got scared and deleted his account. Some people really do think we're like some brave collective of hackerman badasses, each with our own corkboard and bunch of yarn, connecting pictures and dates and files, making it into a case. We need good connecting-the-dots theme songs, all suspenseful and tense.

    And if you don't believe their most crack-headed, least-likely theories, then you must be a shill! They've been doing this since way before pizzagate. I've gotten used to it. I wouldn't worry. Just keep the more solid stuff in mind, but keep also a healthy dose of skepticism.

    It's bound to happen in a situation like this. We have a limited set of evidence set before us, and can only draw so many conclusions from it. Without a stream of new evidence or information to further link things together, we'll just continue down the rabbit hole coming up with more and more outlandish things trying to make something of nothing.

    Ya can't investigate an underground Illuminati satanic cult without a tinfoil hat... or else you write off stuff like

     "Lou Malnati's Pizzeria"

    as just a coincidence.

    It's past the point of worrying about speculation. They put it right out there with FBI confirmed pedo logos. I want some fucking answers. The sick fucker even has pictures of infants taped to tables. They're gonna let this guy operate a business?
