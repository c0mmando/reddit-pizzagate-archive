<p><p>"while rumors about pedophilia and child trafficking remain standard in urban folklore, roughly 90 percent of assaults on children in the U.S. are committed by a friend or family member"</p>
<p>Seriously? Child Trafficking is folklore? are we just going to ignore missing children stats?</p>
<p>"According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, roughly 800,000 children are reported missing each year in the United States -- that's roughly 2,000 per day."</p></p>

<p><p>Ah yes, child trafficking now according to Snopes, is up there with the mothman and chupacabre urban folklore. Of course. How stupid of me for ever thinking such a thing could be real. Thank you snopes</p></p>

<p><p>Actually that stat is misleading according to the coauthor of the study who is also the director of Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire.</p>
<p>"The number of kids who are actually kidnapped by strangers is quite small," says Finkelhor.
Just 115 of the 797,500 children were subject to what Finkelhor and his co-authors define as a "stereotypical" kidnapping - that is, they were abducted by a stranger and detained overnight, perhaps permanently, or taken at least 50 miles away.</p>
<p>It's still definitely a problem, and it doesn't mean that people should stop protecting children, but 800,000 a year would mean 80,000,000 children have gone missing the last decade. That's a fourth of the population of the United States. </p></p>

<p><p>"we are unable to locate any substantive aspect of the claims that could be fact-checked or otherwise held up to the light to determine their veracity"</p>
<p>So why make a judgement then? This is an ongoing investigation not an assertion of charges. Yes some people are jumping the gun but nothing has been proven either way.</p>
<p>Also "To the alt right, though, "pizza" became a suspected code word" Why are we being grouped in with that shit? Why are thousands of people being defined politically?</p></p>

<p><p>Well, I've never been quoted on Snopes before, so that's a first.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>None of it was true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except for all the parts they quoted that are obvious facts? Like It really being owned by James Alefantis, him being gay, and being the boyfriend of David Brock, who is the CEO of Correct the Record?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pilfered from the restaurant’s social media pages and the personal accounts of friends who had “liked” Comet Ping Pong online.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>@jimmycomet instagram was run by James Alefantis himself, even according to the bio page of it and the multiple captures where he posted interview transcripts of himself. He even admits that images were pulled FROM HIS SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT. </p>
<p>Their whole argument hinges on the New York Times article being 100% true, which is hilarious given that said article provided no evidence of any kind to support their counterclaims.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>assertions that underground tunnels linked adjacent business</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wasn't part of my summary at all. So they're rolling in other stuff rather sporadically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"linking" unrelated Instagram screengrabs, a number of individuals supposedly involved</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Unrelated" as in all of those individuals WORKED AT COMET PING PONG and were all liking each other's posts. Great detective work guys! @workingonmanightcheese is pictured in the photo of the trenching work. @joshuaryanv worked as a bartender at Comet Ping Pong for several years. @ccwoolman worked there fore several years as their Event Planner and her kids are in the majority of the relevant photos.</p></p>
