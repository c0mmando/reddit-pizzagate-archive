    We still need confirmation of where the Podestas were during this time. The police sketches clearly resemble these two. Only once we have proof can we clear their names from the crime.

     This was the theory I've been going on.

    My theory -- that yes, the McCsnns accidentally caused her overdose.  But that the Podestas were spotted with A DIFFERENT GIRL resembling Madeleine. And that they were both spotted individually with her at different times. Possibly a handoff was made. This explains two TOTALLY different composite sketches, with each one almost a perfect match of one of the brothers. Its truly uncanny how close they each are.

    One might respond.... "are you kidding?  They'd have to be incredibly unlucky. "
   </p>
   <p>
    To which I'd respond, "or God exists and sees the ritual abuse of trafficked children and is going to execute justice upon the perpetrators of such evil. "
   </p>
   <p>
    (That is...IF It is proven that they are involved in such things. Right now, based on the soft evidence that the public has, I'd give it a 30-40% chance. )
