        <strong>Confusion regarding Bif Skipman/David Flintstone</strong>
        <p><p>I remember reading part of the thread about a Reddit user who found strange wifi signals but I didn't get much further and now I'm hearing about some kind of underground Hawaiian facility? Could someone explain the deal with Bif Skipman/David Flintsone?</p></p>

        <p><p>Flintstone and Skipman are the same person. Wifi signals was reported by fbianon. The location of the pictures taken is 577 Pakala Street, Honolulu, HI. The links are buried somewhere in this sub.</p></p>
