        <strong>[Fact Summary] + [Speculation] Moves and Counter Moves</strong>
        <p><p>Part 1: A short introduction to the situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It has been a little over 2 weeks since the tip of the iceberg was struck. Hillary Clinton's top advisor, campaign chairman, advisor to president Obama, and former Chief of Staff to Bill Clinton, John Podesta was linked by his own emails, uncovered by WikiLeaks, to a private fundraiser dinner, known as Spirit Cooking, hosted by occultist "preforming artist" Marina Abramovic. The reputation of "Spirit Cooking" is somewhat secretive, with explanations ranging from simple soup recipes, art and self-expression, to former occult members claiming the true practice of spirit cooking involves ritual infant abuse and sacrifice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Driven by morbid curiosity, the reddit and 4chan community began looking further into the thousands of emails released to the public by WikiLeaks. Within what previously looked like spam emails, dinner party invites, and recipe swaps, the internet sleuth community found a surprising amount of references to "Pizza," "Cheese," "Maps," and Handkerchiefs." <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/23561">For one of the many emails containing these references, look here</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The terms are incredibly concerning as they are known to the FBI to a secret code system that pedophiles use to communicate to one another and advertise safe places to meet socially and conduct various illicit acts and business transactions. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/FBI_pedophile_symbols">For more info look here</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was also incredibly concerning due to "About" page and logo of Besta Pizza, a pizza shop near the White House, containing a known symbol for Pedophilia. The logo was changed on NOV 10, 2016 without statement, after this story broke. <a href="https://i.sli.mg/SjWSAu.png">Pic before it was changed</a> , <a href="http://archive.is/V2XBu">Pic after</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following the social media trail of another often-referenced DC Pizza joint, Comet Pizza and Ping Pong, that was left public until this week, the community discovered, archived and shared evidence of countless references to a sex-obsessed sub-culture, strange artwork, and suggestive comments about and pictures of very young children, one of which, later found to be named Juniper, was taped by her arms to a table in front of an adult male <a href="https://archive.fo/YJJnJ">pic here, no indecency but still disturbing</a> , 
For the full depository of archived social media postings, saved before they were removed or made private, <a href="https://github.com/PedoHunter/pizzagate">look here</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comet Pizza is owned by James Achilles Alefantis, who GQ magazine listed as one of the Top 50 Most Powerful People of Washington. All roads lead to Rome, and in Pizza-Gate, much of the red flags point directly back to Alefantis, his instagram account "jimmycomet", and his hipster "after-hours for all ages" pizza place. [For more info on Mr. Alefantis, look here] (https://steemit.com/personsofinterest/@ausbitbank/persons-of-interest-james-achilles-alefantis-aka-jimmycomet-at-comet-ping-pong)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further along in the search for truth, the reddit/4chan community finds more and more reason to be concerned that this is not a baseless conspiracy, but a real-life, organized criminal ring of powerful elites using their influence and funds to not-only indulge in regular, systematic child abuse and murder, but use the very systems sworn to protect youths, like orphanages and the foster care system, as cover to abduct and deliver victims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More info comes to light regarding John Podesta and his brother Tony Podesta, in regards to their incredible likeness to Law Enforcement sketches made of 2 men suspected in the 2007 abduction of child Madeline McCann. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/q4wCy">Info-graphic here</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a surface level explanation of the basics and leaves many connections to the larger picture (which is still being analyzed) out. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5cr74l/pizzagate_link_compilation/">For a detailed list of links, further evidence and research material, look here</a></p>
<p>Part 2: An Analysis of The Major Moves</p>
<p>Now that you know the basics, here is a speculative analysis of the chess-moves that have happened and will possibly happen in the coming weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Move 1: Emails are leaked to WikiLeaks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move 2: WikiLeaks chooses to post them for the public</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move 3: The Reddit and 4chan investigates publicly and finds disturbing trends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move 4: The subjects of the investigation react by removing or setting to private many traces that were discovered, indicating that they are aware of the investigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move 5: Investigation Continues but a growing trend of disorganization, CTR style vote manipulation, and shill-style dis-information type posts and comments are noticed and discussed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move 6: Incoming</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Move 6 is why I have created this post. I want to warn the community. </p>
<p>Given the noticed trends of lack of media attention on the issue (focusing on George Soros funded "protests"), the going-to-ground knee-jerk reaction without public statements by those investigated, and the growing number of shills and disinformation being spread, it is reasonable to assume that another more organized response will happen shortly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Within their playbook, we have observed silencing of witnesses both violently and non-violently, manipulation of the public opinion via the Mainstream Media and Social Media, including Correct the Record's manipulation of Reddit by bots, paid employees, the banning of users, changing of moderators, and up/downvote manipulation of one sides posts, as well as false-flags (operations that cause social unrest or violence and are organized for the purpose of placing the blame on a targeted opposition group. Example: A popular theory: The US Gov wanted a war with Cuba but the American people didn't. The USS Maine explodes and is sunk off of the Cuban coast; the media blames Cuba, the US People are outraged and now fully support the War.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While this is a peaceful investigation that seeks only provable facts, some of the above scare/manipulation tactics have already been observed on reddit. More tactics may come, including attacks on the users and moderators of reddit and 4chan. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Online Freedom of Speech communities like reddit are now a direct threat and will now be specifically targeted. A false-flag could include the "false" accusations towards someone whose career and life suffers, resulting in public outcry against "irresponsible online vigilantes," "dangerous digital sleuths," and a media campaign to "protect the public" from itself. Slogans could include similar attacks made on the 2nd amendment: "the power of the internet is too dangerous to be entrusted to the public," "the 1st Amendment is outdated, was written before the internet age."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An all out counter move is being crafted as we speak:</p>
<p>If the people we are looking into are anything that they publicly appear to be, it is a safe bet they are conducting damage control and stopping leaks at a cyclic rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the evidence is unavoidable and makes it to the mainstream ears and eyes,  fall-guys will be selected and felled. A media campaign and script will be written. The dark circle will be made to look small, localized, shameful. Everyone else too protected to take the fall will be shocked and horrified at the actions of their peers. New laws will be proposed to "protect" the children. Those new laws will be the new gateways that allow further abuse and atrocities to go without notice or justice. New security measures, codes, and methods of communications will be crafted and enforced, making these types of underground societies harder to spot and harder to prosecute.</li>
</ul>
<p>I, and many others, truly HOPE none of the bad things we are finding are actually happening. Violence will not be condoned, and peoples reputations must be protected where deserved. A simple hunt within the documents made public, and listing of these peoples own words in their own emails, and on their own social media sites CANNOT and SHOULD NOT ever be considered an attack on that individual. Everyone is responsible for the content they make public or that they sign their name to. </p>
<p>TLDR: To accomplish the mission and to protect ourselves, we must further dedicate the work done here to a peaceful investigation of the FACTS that is rooted deeply in concern for the possible victims, a relentless search for justice for ALL involved, and truth for the American Public.</p></p>

        <p><p>I left a lot out to keep things somewhat accessible to newcomers and to avoid misstatements. I Also got burnt out. If you or anyone have solid leads or have something prepared to add I will gladly make an edit.</p></p>

        <p><p>Is there anyway to publicly "ear mark" known shill/bot/misinformation accounts, past keeping track of it in private? I know this might be a long shot, considering they seem to delete the moment they are caught, and I wouldn't want to contribute to legitimate accounts being labeled, but would something like that be useful in any way?</p></p>
