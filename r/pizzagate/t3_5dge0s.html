        <p><p>Go to comet/besta and look around back perhaps for an upstairs that is accessible. If you have seen the cryptic poster in besta. It will make sense. The building next door to comet (left side) caught my eye last night because the second story had a window open and just seemed like some kind of observation point. So get a good look at it as well.</p>
<p>Maybe poke around the curtained off "party area" in comet.</p>
<p>Also periscope guy mentioned a weird address stickied  to the wall in besta with instructions to leave any pizzas on the ground, don't knock. Could you locate the property in that sticky and see if there is anything of consequence there as well? These are the most solid physical leads that were found from the guy who periscope getting kicked out. </p>
<p>If they give you problems suggest that the easiest way to squash this would be to open the restaurant up to everyone for a few hours. All access .</p></p>

        <p><p>Can you take pictures showing the fact that there is no room inside? I believe that those photos could come in handy in showing that Clinton couldn't have held a fundraiser inside the establishment.</p></p>
