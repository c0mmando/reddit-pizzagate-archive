<p><p>This subreddit is linked in the sidebar and we share some mods.</p>
<p>/r/pizzagate is not "hot with censorship."</p>
<p>We have to play by the Admins rules, as will any other subreddit discussing this topic.</p>
<p>This Subreddit should be used as more of a way to showcase the well documented research to the rest of the world once it has been completed without information that Reddit considers doxxing.</p>
<p>It is probably in this Subreddit and everyone heres best interests to keep the bulk of the actual research in the chans, private chat rooms, and anywhere else besides Reddit.</p>
<p>We have never banned anyone or deleted any comments that did not violate Reddit TOS or our Subreddit Rules.</p></p>
