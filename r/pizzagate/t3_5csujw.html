        <strong>Citizen Investigate Documentary into Pizzagate- Traveling to DC</strong>
        <p><p>I'm traveling to DC Tuesday to conduct an investigation and documentary into #pizzagate.  The intention of the film will be to give an organized story into the various discoveries of evidence involving the HRC campaign, other PAC executives, and DOJ officials. I've gathered evidence from this reddit as well as other sources via Instagram.  Are there any specific things one would advice me to focus on looking into, I will be asking bystanders in the area of their awareness and opinion is of the various stores shown to be involved in the schemes .  I'm also wondering what the status of the involved businesses are right now?  Have they been closed to due recent developments?</p></p>

        <p><p>Yes, it was John Ash.  I would like to know what, if any, info can be had about the underground tunnels underneath that complex.  IMO, it's awful shady that there are pics of holes being dug in the ground around there, with no permits.</p>
<p>Are you going alone?  I don't think that's such a great idea dude.  I would bring someone with me.</p></p>

        <p><p>Confronting people is such a bad idea.  Would you just stop that? With what freaking evidence?  You're advocating stopping people that what?  Walk into the restaurant?  Walk by on the sidewalk?</p>
<p>Geez, some people are downright scary.  Leave that kind of investigating to the authorities.  Focus on things that will GET an investigation that is official STARTED...not by scaring any potential witnesses and perps away.</p></p>

        <p><p>Lol.  I think you're replying to the wrong person.  No where in my history of posts have I ever advocated anything in which you are suggesting.    </p>
<p>Edit: for the record, I too think a rando confronting anyone in or near this place is a bad idea for several reasons.  Which is why I was asking him his plan.</p></p>

        <p><p>Stay in the 828.  This investigation has been compromised by the sheer number of people involved.  IF there's any truth to this all incriminating evidence has long since been removed from the pizza place. </p>
<p>There was a guy in there last night from 4chan, he said even some of the questionable art had been removed. </p>
<p>It was over once people started calling and yelling at the hostess. </p>
<p>Save yourself the 8 hour drive and gas money. Go to the Southern and get some shrimp and grits instead.. </p></p>

        <p><p>I agree I hope to do just that. Any info, you think is most important to look into, concerning any of the suspect businesses involved would be helpful. I'm sure the locals have much to say as well...  I heard something about besta pizzas business logo being changed recently.  Is this true? </p></p>

        <p><p>Perhaps you should get up to speed prior to taking a trip to DC on Tuesday lest you make yourself look silly. </p>
<p>The locals will this you're certifiably insane if you go around asking them about this. </p>
<p>There are plenty of pastebins and posts on this sub containing all the relevant and solid information that's been discovered so far.  So do yourself and all the people who have spent hours digging through this shit a favor and know what you're talking about when you go up there before you make this whole thing look even sillier than people already do. </p>
<p>What paper or site do you work for in Asheville? </p></p>

        <p><p>Don't ask people they won't know and probably think you're insane. If they do know you might make yourself a target. </p>
<p>Poke around in the restraunts and the area. Just be aware. Maybe look through some trash bins, connect to open WiFi and see what other computers are connected. "Get lost" looking for the bathroom and see if there are hidden passage ways or anything out of place. If you notice someone going to confront you or take notice fake answer a phone call. If you smoke, smoking is a great way to walk around outside without looking out of place. Get a nice suit, people in that area wear suits and people are less likely to fuck with you or suspect you of doing something. Make note of anything bizarre. Don't bring attention to yourself. Trust your instinct.</p>
<p>Read up on investigative techniques and inflitration to get ideas of what to look for.</p></p>

        <p><p>BE CAREFUL DUDE. Don't just start sticking a mic in people's face with a camera out. Try meeting people kind of casually and sparking up a convo and then ask if they'd be up for an interview later on. </p>
<p>It's going to be hard to get info if you're too forward about it. Also, I would head to Comet Ping Pong as a customer and just scope it out. Try to find secret passages or the tunnels from their insta.</p></p>

        <p><p>maybe so but if the person isn't going to pack they should stay away. If they are serious about doing any worthwhile looking around getting caught could be a fate worse than death. If these people are SRA occultists then they are murderers.</p></p>

        <p><p>Go on a busy night. Be clandestine. Amid the bustle, try to wander off. See if you can snap pictures of any potential underground entrances. It might require walking into restricted areas or areas marked "employees only". Idk if you're bringing lots of equipment, but I would suggest not. If they see that you're there to document anything you'll probably get resistance. </p>
<p>There's a lot of heat on them right now so expect them to have their guard up. Clandestine is the only way to succeed. Above all else, protect yourself. Bring a friend or bring a weapon. If you have anything to drink, I'd recommend sealed soda or bottled water. Probably don't eat, especially if you think they're onto you. </p>
<p>If you had some spy gear, like a micro camera in a pen, that would be perfect. If you get caught in a restricted area, just say you got lost and another patron sent you the wrong way. Ask whoever caught you where the bathroom is and follow them out immediately. Since the bathrooms are hidden, this may not sound their alarms. </p></p>

        <p><p>Purchase a mini drone with a live stream camera, but make sure each model isn't  unique or something so that it doesn't trace back to you. Research a school or day care holding a "pizza party" and bust in with that drone.</p>
<p>Have a mini mic and mini livestream camera on you at ALL times, and a friend monitoring the feed from their end.</p>
<p>I'll probably be doing my own citizen investigation soon, maybe a month or so if something big doesn't happen then.</p>
<p>Good luck to you, comrade.</p></p>

        <p><p>Depending on how much you're able to poke around, see if you're able to observe how business is being run:  cash is king here- are people coming in and making payments or providing paperwork without eating? How big is the actual kitchen relative to the space and number of tables for seating or ping pong for that matter.  Are there servers who wait on ping pong players.   It's possible this is a money laundering front as well as some aspect of location for pedo ring.  I'm sure this has been discussed somewhere.   Also, storage.  There should not be a huge amount of storage area or walk in freezer relative to the restaurant front of house.    Walk the Preminger - look for vents or windows in garden - type units below the main floor. May be visible from outside, or have steps tucked away as an exit. </p></p>
