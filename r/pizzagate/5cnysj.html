    I was admittedly a little skeptical when all this blew up, and I'll state out front that I'm a lifelong Dem, though wasn't a Hillary supporter. I have investigative experience in issues like those presented here (at a state level), though that isn't my job anymore. I have made criminal cases regarding organized criminal activity. A lot of this evidence is circumstantial, but very, VERY intriguing. And terrifying. As an observer up to this point, I just want to suggest you all document and archive everything and don't release evidence if its even a little bit flimsy. They will use that to discredit you.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have no way (or interest) in proving my investigative experience,  but remember to be extremely vigilant in your sleuthing. Keep up the fight.

    if you were to be in charge of this investigation, where do you start? what steps do you take to take this 'circumstantial' evidence and try to find the hard evidence? i'm genuinely curious because i do not have any experience regarding this type of issue and it's even difficult to talk about this with others.

     There is a huge difference between starting this investigation as a law enforcement officer and as a civilian. As a LEO, I'd start looking for credible witnesses and trying to find an informant, or a whistle blower. Anyone who will talk, even if its off the record. I'd also start surveillance on Comet and Alefantis. I'd subpoena the hell out of financial records after that and then have an individual investigator responsible for chasing the money. When investigating vice crimes, you always follow the $$ as a sidebar.
    </p>
    <p>
     None of that really helps us as private citizens, though. We can't do any of that. I have seen some very IMPRESSIVE gumshoe work on here, though, which basically brought this whole thing to light. I'd keep doing that, honestly, and archive the shit out of everything. The problem with crowdsourcing an investigation like this in a public forum is that the badguys can read all of it too, and use that to their advantage. I guarantee, they are reading this right now.

     This investigation is over.
    </p>
    <p>
     It has been compromised so thoroughly that it's beyond repair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps if those that were uncovering this information had been a bit more discerning about who they released it to they'd still be on track.
    </p>
    <p>
     As it stands now the owner of the pizza place knows.  Has made all his social media private. An anon from pol was in the restaurant earlier and said most of the questionable art has been covered up or taken down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Comet Pizza is a dead now.  It has most definitely been cleaned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Reddit and chans are the two worst places I can think of to be releasing this information to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not even a fucking day after reddit saw it people were calling the restaurant and sperging out at the hostess and leaving comments all over their social media...  Now it's gone dark.  As have all the accounts affiliated with it.

      Agreed. I'm afraid the only thing left that will blow this open is if Wikileaks is sitting on some very incriminating shit.

         As gloomy as the outcome seems, regarding the perps going dark, this was the only course of action available. Info like this could not have escaped law enforcements notice for this long.
        </p>
        <p>
         Releasing the emails to the public was obviously going to make for an explosive and messy investigation, but the word spread, and the perps have been forced to react.
        </p>
        <p>
         If a single kids life was spared via the word spreading, then it's encouraging.

          Agreed that this could all have saved a life. To be morbidly honest, it could have also costed lives. Purging tangible evidence isn't limited to social media posts or changing logos. The victims themselves are evidence. I know thats dark as fuck to think about, but its a reality.

      I thought the same thing. Whatever evidence that was in comet, is likely gone. However as I posted on another reddit, there may be enough evidence to stay ahead of them and figure out where they would move to. I would think they are within same area of comet, as they obviously have clientele in area.
     </p>
     <p>
      It's surely not over. They are arrogant elitist fucks. Just need to stay on top and follow any and all leads. If you may have info re: Twitter, instagram etc as a lead just maybe keep it close to you or small circle, don't blow up the spot.
     </p>
     <p>
      Its not over. Keep fighting

    I guess one question. What should one do if they find evidence (unsure how familair you are with everything). Some people on 4chan and 8chan grabbed some encrypted files and suspected stenograph files from "pizza sites". The thing is if they crack it they're fucked cause they now are in posetion of cp and if they report it there is a chance higher up with go after person handing over evidence instead of following up

     I would def not recommend anyone being in possession of suspected CP files taken from their site. I know the intent is to expose them, but if this goes as deep as we all think it does, they will get quietly railroaded for being in poss of illegal media. My hope now is that Anon or Wikileaks finds some incriminating evidence that is difficult to ignore.

    From your experience, could you please tell me, say on a scale of 1-10, how likely it is one might dig a tunnel, or use some kind of "invisible transport"

    One is a house and one is a warehouse, both belonging to the same Brooklyn shipping company. Brooklyn, NY. Yet their fax number is from Seattle, and apparently a "known number" for BoyWiki.

     A very primitive smuggling tunnel would be very feasible, assuming there weren't any sewers or utility lines in the way. To build a stable, concrete walled passage would be a little more difficult, but not impossible. Check out some of the border tunnels that traffickers dig on the U.S. / Mexico border. The distance on your map view is very feasible.

      Just looked at map. I would say highly unlikely a tunnel from point a to b in that area of Brooklyn. Between con ed, Brooklyn union gas, Verizon etc..  they are always digging up street and opening swalks for repair and install. However, it's deff a good area to hide something in plain sight. Busy, bustling area.

    Logged back on after seeing this sub fly way off the rails. I get the passion. That passion can easily make this whole effort lose credibility though. I won't even comment on the recent honeypot or Twitter stuff (though the Twitter stuff looks legit) but in order to be taken seriously we need to stay away from publicly promoting angles the common reader would discount. We can pursue those angles, but lets not promote them as the first thing someone sees coming here.
   </p>
   <p>
    For example; If someone came to you and proposed a global conspiracy concerning a pedo network and asked you to help crack it, it would catch most of you folks' interest. Even if you weren't awake yet.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now add that there is a massive Satanic conspiracy involved, with actual Satanists and demonic influence, and you've lost a large part of your audience. I have put folks in prison for child sex crimes, and the common denominator on all of them is that they use whatever means necessary to control and extort their victims. Whatever guise that comes in, whether it be the occult or just plain manipulation, we need to use the same investigative techniques to root it out.
   </p>
   <p>
    I know the idea of a global Satanic conspiracy catches the imagination better, but I've seen a lot of evil in my work before moving on to another field and they didn't all wear horns and carry a plastic pitchfork. Lets not lose sight of that as we dig deeper into this. I have been hesitant to comment on some things because any counterpoint or alternate viewpoint as far as where we should shine our light has been met with paranoid, dismissive responses.
