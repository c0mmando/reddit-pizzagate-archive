        <strong>WHich 3 letter agency to trust?</strong>
        <p><p>Have heard lots of talk that cia and nsa are at war with each other in some technological power race.</p>
<p>Lots of talk, loooots of talk about agencies being bad.</p>
<p>So who do we trust. Which agency do we know that will take info and actually investigate? </p></p>

        <p><p>None. They are all fighting for control. The way I see it, the CIA has Clinton ties (flying in cocaine to Mena, AK when Bill was governor - also friends with the Bush family dynasty). They are the old power structure. The NSA has stepped up in the advent of technology like PRISM which gives them <em>full</em>'surveillance on <em>everyone</em> so they are creeping up the ladder in terms of power. They are the new power structure. </p>
<p>I think the NSA leaked things to wikileaks. They know. They know everything, and they want to be at the helm as the new intelligence antihero. </p>
<p>The FBI is in constant competition with these two, mostly. The FBI is also experiencing disdain from within for many of the lower agents want to be the good guys, but the veterans in the bureau adhere to the system that has been in place since Hoover (e.g. Blackmail, agent provocateurs, illegal entrapments, etc)</p>
<p>That's the way I see it at least. No matter what, we will have to keep fighting whatever power structure rises to the top next. The enemy of my enemy is my friend, but still be weary of all of them. </p></p>

        <p><p>The record has been corrected.  Thanks for the international help.  I don't know much about the Canadian agencies but if we can get international pressure on this investigation it will help.  I think contacting international media would be better to contact than international govt agencies.</p></p>

        <p><p>The Clintons preemptively created the organizations that would investigate the trafficking ring and placed people in charge that would do the exact opposite. </p>
<p>It's a standard wolf in sheep's clothing tactic, just on an insane global scale. This is mostly for US agencies and UN agencies. Other governments may or may not be the same. </p></p>

        <p><p>Director Comey revived the FBI investigation into Clinton's e-mails one week before the election and then concluded it the day before. Considering it had taken the FBI the better part of a year to go through 33,000 e-mails and just a week to go through the new 650,000, this second investigation reminded people of the e-mail scandal and made it look like Clinton was being protected by corrupt agencies, right before the election. </p></p>

        <p><p>First case is like pulling someone over for speeding... and then finding a pile of dead hookers and cocaine in the back seat... You're not really concerned with the speeding ticket anymore. </p>
<p>FBI used the "server" as a smokescreen to keep the foundation off balance and to get the corrupt people obstructing justice to publicly out themselves... The real investigation is about what he found in the emails... not how the server was set up... it was a trick and almost everyone has fallen for it. FBI won't comment on an ongoing case... so we don't know about the huge shit they are planning. </p></p>

        <p><p>I've spent hours listening to his testimony and sifting thru his statements... if you don't trust Comey to do what's right it is only cause you get your "news" interpreted for you by TV and facebook... He's an easy target to hate when you are spoonfed soundbites... take off your baby bib and do your homework. </p></p>

        <p><p>So why didn't he prosecute Hillary with more than enough evidence? Something along the lines of, he didn't want Obama to pardon Hillary, he wants Trump to be able to toast here... I will believe it when I see it </p></p>

        <p><p>Be patient... you are too used to politics being a reality show. Hillary when go down when the case is complete... not when it would be most entertaining for the folks at home. </p>
