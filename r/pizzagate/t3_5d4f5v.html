        <p><p>I can vouch that this is happening in Nashville too. Court system attempted to do the same thing to us. Thank heaven's they weren't successful but, they would have been had I not threatened under oath to bring up the judge and state attorney's affiliation to freemasonry and remarked about the judge buying residential properties from BofA for 10% the fair market value that were actually forclosed in a courtroom 2 doors down the hallway by his own friend (another judge) </p>
<p>Anyone that ever finds themselves in the same position as the OP. Please take the time to look into public records of property owned by the court officials involved. Imo this is one of the biggest forms of bribery going on and could be quite helpful if you use that information tactfully. Every situation is different though so look but don't get bogged down or discouraged if no leads are found through this method.  Always follow the money and anything of substantial value. Often they can't take bribes in the form of currency because it is too obvious to investigators....this is what our justice system has devolved into. NO MATTER WHAT!,  NEVER ACCEPT DEFEAT WHEN YOUR CHILDRENS LIVES ARE IN THE BALANCE!!  YOU CAN MAKE ENOUGH NOISE THAT YOUR CHILDS VALUE IS LESS (to them) THAN THE RISK OF BEING EXPOSED!!</p>
<p>also, beware of your own lawyer working with the other side. They only think of their career and it's better for their career to end a case amicable with the state and their attorneys than getting justice for your child. And NEVER expect your lawyer to look into the corruption angle. They are always complicit to an extent.</p></p>

        <p><p>a lot of corrupt judges are affiliated with Freemasonry and that may be something they don't want people looking into the politics of.  Never give up on children!</p></p>

        <p><p>It's true. The entire ambience of the courtroom changed from the moment I brought up freemason connections in a sane manner. My lawyer refused to address it. Suggested I take a deal. Never take a deal. We assigned ourselves the right to a jury trial for a good reason. </p></p>

        <p><p>Do you have any info on the correlation between freemasonry and corruption? </p></p>

        <p><p>Three things:
1. Land/property as a bribe is worth looking into (at least a quick glance to see if anything looks odd). I read the testimony Epstein's pilot gave and he said Epstein gifted him land on his island to build a house on (far away from Epstein's house). 
2. I'm a fellow Nashvillian &amp; just learned that our local officials have been blocking public records about any sexual harassment cases or complaints made about them. One rep. Has 22 official complaints that a journalist dug up. I'm looking into this shit like crazy. 
3. You're bad ass, straight-up!</p></p>
